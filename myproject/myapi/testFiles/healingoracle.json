COULD NOW HAVE AIDS", "content": "Fresh statistics out of Germany this week reflect yet more worrying facts about vaccines that much of the world will not see .\nThis will never be broadcast .\nThey will not be debating this in TV studios .\nThe latest \u2018 variant \u2019 getting stuck in everyone \u2019 s throat is \u2018 Omnicrom \u2019 which is revealing yet more troubling data .\nThanks to German efficiency for record keeping , they have recorded everything and so it their statistics that reveal the truth behind the headlines and suggest that the Immune System of the fully vaccinated is now in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nA disorder also referred to as Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome , or AIDS .\nThe rapid speed of virus to vaccine is record breaking , as new variants emerge , scaring the world into more and more jabs that have been mandated on the entire world and in exchange for basic human rights and freedom .\nThanks to The Daily Expose this week who covered this story : \u201c German Government Data for the alleged Omicron variant of Covid-19 , suggests that most of the \u201c fully vaccinated \u201d will have full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( AIDS ) by the end of January 2022 , after confirming that the immune systems of the fully vaccinated have already degraded to an average of minus 87 % The German Government Covid-19 figures are produced by the \u2018 Robert Koch Institut \u2019 ( see ) .\nTheir latest data is available as a downloadable pdf .\nPage 14 has their Weekly COVID-19 management report from December 30 , 2021 \u2013 \u201c Additional information is known to some extent for the Omikron cases in the reporting system .\nfor 6,788 cases were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly none or mild symptoms indicated .\nIt was most common by patients with symptoms Runny nose ( 54 % ) , cough ( 57 % ) and sore throat ( 39 % ) mentioned .\n124 patients were hospitalized , four people died .\nExposure abroad was reported for 543 ( 5 % ) cases .\n186 patients were unvaccinated , 4,020 were fully vaccinated , of these , a booster vaccination was reported for 1,137 .\nOn the basis of the transmitted data 148 reinfections were found among all transmitted Omicron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were reported to the person affected by reinfection .\nSee below for the distribution of the Omikron cases reported so far in Germany .\nOmicron cases have been detected in all federal states.\n\u201d In Germany 70.53 % are fully vaxxed , 2.97 % are partially vaxxed and 26.5 % unvaxxed \u2013 https : //ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations So unvaxxed have 186 cases out of 26.5 % of the population Fully vaxxed have 4020 cases out of 70.53 % of the population .\nVaccines should always be considered with full knowledge and exposure to these risks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much against such open discussion and now seems to simply exist as a vaccine propaganda sponsor .\nMeanwhile , we continue to warn people .\nPlease see this post from early last year , as according to a prominent vaccine creator who was so worried by this global catastrophe ( back in March 2021 ) that he risked everything by going public about his concerns : \u201c As a dedicated virologist and vaccine expert I only make an exception when the Health Authority is allowed vaccines to be administered in ways that threaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being ignored .\nThe present extremely critical situation forces me to spread this emergency call .\nAs the unprecedented extent of human intervention in the COVID-19 pandemic is now at risk of resulting in a global catastrophe without equal this call can not sound loudly and strongly enough .\nSufficient scientific evidence has been brought to the table .\nUnfortunately , it remains untouched by those who have the power to act .\nHow long can one ignore the problem when there is at present massive evidence that viral immune escape is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say we didn \u2019 t know \u2013 or were not warned.\n\u201d So fast forward to what we are now seeing via German data\u2026 The Daily Expose goes on to say : \u201c Vaccine effectiveness = immune system effectiveness = ( 1-8.12 ) /8.12 = -7.12/8.12 = -87.7 % .\nSo the vaccinated have an 87.7 % lower immune response than the unvaccinated have to Omicron .\nThis means that the average German is down to the last 12.3 % of his or her immune system for fighting certain classes of viruses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with more variants and more vaccines being developed , this could perhaps only be the beginning .\nNot for the first time It is not entirely a new suggestion that a huge vaccine program could carry the very virus that causes HIV and AIDS .\nAs we reported back in November 2014 : \u201c Africans are aware of the man-made theory of AIDS , and the possibility that the WHO \u2019 s extensive vaccine programs in Africa in the 1970s is connected to the severe outbreak of AIDS in the early 1980s .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ British newspaper The Times published an explosive article entitled , \u201c Smallpox vaccine triggered AIDS virus.\n\u201d The story suggested the smallpox eradication vaccine program sponsored by the WHO was responsible for unleashing AIDS in Africa .\nAlmost 100 million Africans living in central Africa were inoculated by the WHO .\nThe vaccine was held responsible for awakening a \u201c dormant \u201d AIDS virus infection on the continent.\n\u201d Please also watch this following video , featuring the doctor behind the MMR vaccine and 3 dozen others .\nThe video , recorded before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from all media broadcasts .\nIn the footage he clearly admits to putting SV40 ( Cancer ) in the polio vaccine and importing monkeys to start the HIV virus .\nWhilst it has been known since 2019 that Vaccines turn your immune system into reverse and as such the immune system can be sent into turmoil by such huge doses of toxins .\nPlease read the article in full here Vaccines have always had dangerous side effects , but of course the vaccine makers remain immune from prosecution .\nIn the USA Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars was awarded to the families of vaccine victims ( in a long lasting exhausting legal minefield that is the Vaccine Injury Court .\nWhilst back in 1986 The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act ( NCVIA ) absolved all drug companies from all medico-legal liability when children die , become chronically ill with vaccine-induced autoimmune disorders , or are otherwise disabled from vaccine injuries : \u201c No vaccine manufacturer shall be liable\u2026for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury or death.\n\u201d \u2013 President Ronald Wilson Reagan said , as he signed the deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put whatever they want in vaccines as they will never be held liable .\nIt is never too late to wake up to what is happening .\nIts not too late to say enough is enough and be brave enough to ask the questions that matter and refuse these \u201c jabathons \u201d as Boris Jonson likes to refer to them .\nAnd as the vaccine gravy express train continues to grow in strength , for many this may feel like too late , but we implore you , consider the effects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another jab.\n\u201d We now live in an age that the act of another stranger injecting unknown and untested substances into you and your children \u2019 s arms is seen as the answer to everything .\nIf it \u2019 s free , then you are the experiment .\nThese

PATIENTS!", "content": "The Nagalase test is advertised as a highly accurate early cancer detection method .\nLabs that offer this test state that the enzyme rises during very early stages of Cancer because these cells use it to suppress the immune system and augment their growth.\n\u201d Does this test yield what is promised & advertised ?\nRead to learn more !\nThe ( In ) Famous Story of Nagalase : Nagalase is a type of protein that can suppress the immune system by breaking down some important white blood cells called macrophages .\nVDTP/GcMAF helps produce Gc macro inflammatory peptide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it hard to fight infections or cancerous growths from spreading to other body organs .\nSpecifically , nagalase breaks down the Gc protein , which inhibits the production of VDTP/GcMAF [ 1 ] .\nMany research found that cancer cells and invading viruses use nagalase to infect the host and spread further .\n[ 2 , 3 , 4 ] When cancer cells and viruses like HIV release nagalase , it further blocks the production of VDTP/GcMAF .\nThis prevents macrophages \u2019 activation , which is essential for our immune system \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invaders like tumor cells .\nWith a deficiency in these white blood cell populations , you could end up with an unchecked disease that will not disappear even after surgeries .\nResearchers have developed a treatment based on the VDTP/GcMAF molecule .\nThis treatment activates your macrophages & boosts your body \u2019 s immune system , fighting off cancer , HIV , and other chronic illnesses .\nThis treatment has also been effective in autism and autoimmune diseases [ 5 , 6 ] .\nMany researchers found that nagalase levels can increase when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a few discussed .\nNagalase levels are bound to increase during viral infections .\nThis suppresses the immune system response .\nInfluenza A & HIV patients have shown an increased nagalase activity in their blood and body systems .\n[ 7 ] Since cancer cells release nagalase enzymes , people suffering from cervical , prostate , breast , and other cancers reflect high levels of nagalase .\nWith the advancing stages of cancer , the nagalase levels keep increasing .\nMany studies suggest that children with autism may have increased nagalase activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy people , autoimmune patients with lupus have higher nagalase activity [ 9 ] .\nPeople who are alcohol-dependent individuals have significantly higher levels of nagalase compared to healthy individuals .\n[ 10 ] Many types of research have shown effective cancer treatment using VDTP/GcMAF .\nImmunotherapy patients have been successfully treated using the body \u2019 s immune system capabilities .\nHowever , rather than exploring the potential of natural cancer immunotherapy , a small faction of the world chose to tarnish such studies and labeled them as \u2018 lacking scientific bases \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marketers found grounds to promote the traditional cancer treatments over natural cancer treatment without trying to understand its efficacy even once .\nAccording to the study , cancer cells cloak themselves through an invisible chemical shield of \u2018 Nagalase \u2019 ( \u03b1-N-acetylgalactosaminidase ) .\nThis also stops the production of natural VDTP/GcMAF in the body system .\nRemember , VDTP/GcMAF is vital to activate Macrophages that destroy cancer cells and other pathogens in the body .\nVDTP/GcMAF immunotherapy works by compensating the blocked natural MAF by cancer cells \u2019 Nagalase enzyme .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ doses of VDTP/GcMAF .\nAs soon as the body receives the required dose , it triggers warrior white blood cells ( macrophages ) that kill cancerous cells .\nIf taken in tandem with traditional cancer treatments like chemotherapy , radiation therapy , or surgery \u2013 immunotherapy for cancer and autism patients can work wonders .\nNagalase studies date back to the \u2019 90s and VDTP/GcMAF studies to the \u2019 00s with no recent quality research .\nBut when you search for nagalase and VDTP/GcMAF on the web , you will find doctors recommending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggesting how VDTP/GcMAF has been successfully used to treat prostate cancer , breast cancer , other types of cancer [ 11 ] , HIV [ 12 ] , Sclerosis [ 13 ] , and many other diseases !\nTo learn more about the efficacy of the VDTP/GCMAF immunotherapy , we need to trust the research and keep a broader perspective .\nIf you are having problems sourcing a genuine product , here is one link where you can source VDPT/GcMaf

@ @ and the onward march of the New World Order .\nFor it is here that the people are making their presence known by standing firm to their beliefs and traditions .\nThey are willing to protest , to make a stand and to refuse the much talked about toxic jabs .\nThe vaccines have a very low uptake , as most people in Bulgaria understand that your health is your own business and the necessity to take care of yourself has always been important , but it is their body , it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not more countries stood up for reason , for tradition and for freedom ?\nIn Bulgaria they know not to trust their politicians , or their TV sets .\nThey know and understand that the system is rotten .\nThey also know how to grow their own food and take care of themselves .\nFor them , organic food is simply food .\nGrowing it any other way is simply not as good for you .\nWe say \u201c GO BULGARIA !\n\u201d Their history is full of foreign invasion that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined the European Union in 2007 and have seen much change in this time , some things have improved , somethings have not .\nAnd so as the world has been gripped by media fear and propaganda over a global plandemic virus with a 99 % survival rate , one small country in the Balkans remains firm against the New World Order .\nBefore joining the EU , Bulgaria was under communist rule and like many of its neighbouring countries like Serbia and Romania has a deeeper understanding of political corruption than others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people that attempt to wield power over them is a healthy one and has led them to be one of Europe \u2019 s least vaccinated .\nPlease see this article from GenuineProspect that describes the local mood against the fear mongering and coercion of the New World Order : \u201c I spent the first lockdown in Bulgaria and can assure you that except the closed schools , malls and stores life was normal .\nPeople still were people and connected with each other .\nThey would stay outside the communist condos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSometimes you would hear \u201c Police are coming !\n\u201d If the police comes they would join .\nThey know they have no power over citizens .\nThere were also no dead bodies on the streets despite it being supposedly the plague of our times .\nIt is strange because Bulgaria has aging population and if was that we would see it .\nMy own mother is in the vulnerable age but never stopped doing what she does \u2013 having the time of her life with her friends .\nThe lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopping the atrocious creatures behind the New World Order .\nCaging people wasn \u2019 t enough , we need to be experimental animals and all must be injected with experimental medical treatments .\nYet , that isn \u2019 t working in Bulgaria as well .\nExperimental medical treatment isn \u2019 t accepted well and only 15 % of the people had a dose .\nEuropean Union is pushing hard .\nThis isn \u2019 t surprising since the husband of EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen , Heiko von der Leyen , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company Orgenesis .\nThe company just announced a cell-based vaccine platform targeting COVID-19 & other existing and emerging viral diseases .\nYes , everything is about money and control .\nIt happened in the past and we , the Bulgarians resisted .\nWhen the Nazis ordered to Bulgaria to send Bulgarian Jews to the death camps Bulgarians just said that isn \u2019 t happening .\nThey didn \u2019 t let the train with Jews to leave by simply lying at the front of it .\nArmed SS officers surrounded them .\nMiraculously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were let to go home .\nNo trains like it ever left Bulgaria .\nJacky Comforty directed the 2001 documentary \u201c The Optimists , \u201d about how Bulgaria foiled Hitler \u2019 s extermination plans .\n\u201c We have an example of the power of the common man to stop genocide , \u201d Comforty told The Washington Post in 2013 , on the 70th anniversary of Bulgarians \u2019 mass protests .\nSo this is how we are doing it today : we resist , we disobey , we aren \u2019 t afraid , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resistance create local committees .\nThey send letters to authorities , filling lawsuits against the measures , spread information , organize protests , visit the experimental medical treatment spots , and ask for documents .\nRecently it was even in the news that they attacked such place .\nTruth was they asked for approval to do such a job and proof that the experimental medical treatment is legal in Bulgaria .\nThe people didn \u2019 t have any of it .\nPolice came and the experimental medical treatment inoculation spot was closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twist it but there are videos which show that the resistance members just politely ask for information .\nThe inoculation spot was closed because didn \u2019 t have documents to work .\nWhile in many countries people can not participate in the everyday activities without a test or proof of inoculation with the experimental medical treatment , life in Bulgaria is normal .\nParents aren \u2019 t letting testing and masking of kids at school .\nThere was never ban to visit relatives , because family matters in Bulgaria .\nFamily is such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by EU and WEF the Bulgarian government never implemented measures which are against the family traditions .\nPart of the New World Order is to dehumanize and remove family connections .\nThis again isn \u2019 t happening in Bulgaria .\nI am asked every day how one can move to Bulgaria .\nWell , this isn \u2019 t that difficult , there is always space for decent people , but what about saving your own country ?\nI told you how above , so again : resist , find like minded , organize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get your freedom back .\nThe weapons used against you are yours because you pay the police and the army .\nGovernments is you !\nNobody has right to tell you how to live your life and what to do with your own body

.\nWell , we say don \u2019 t give up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay indoors and stay afraid .\nBut we hope that people can continue to travel , to live and to have a healthy happy lifestyle .\nSo we celebrate

replication-incompetent adenovirus type 26 expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein , ethanol , citric acid monohydrate , trisodium citrate dihydrate , 2 hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin ( HBCD ) , polysorbate-80 , sodium chloride .\nThe Janssen vaccine does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIf you would have noticed , the Janssen vaccine contains ethanol which is a very unhealthy ingredient to be injected into a population comprising different age groups .\nEthanol affects cognition in several ways .\nIt affects memory by disrupting the function of acetylcholine in the hippocampus .\nThis mechanism is directly involved with regulating learning and memory functions .\nEthanol also interferes with glutamate signalling , crucial to normal brain development and synaptic plasticity .\nWhilst a \u201c causal effect has been observed between alcohol and various cancers \u201d according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you need a healthy immune system .\nA vaccine that contains ethanol disrupts the immune system

polysorbate-80 is that it may trigger anaphylaxis .\n\u2022 Polysorbate-80 is an emulsifier used in foods to improve their quality , i.e.\n, to enhance smoothness and lengthen shelf life .\nIt also enhances the effectiveness of certain medicines , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from settling out of suspension or separating into layers at low temperatures .\n\u2022 Potential health concerns : Some

the heart muscle ) , hypertension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain ) , ischemic stroke ( decreased blood supply to the brain ) , acute myocardial infarction ( heart attack ) , congestive heart failure , pancreatitis , and fatty liver disease .\nAdditionally , ethanol is a direct neurotoxin , and insufficient dosage can cause lasting dementia .\nHowever , ethanol also has neuroprotectant properties and , in low-to-moderate dosage , reduces the risk of dementia , including Alzheimer \u2019 s type .\nIn fetuses , ethanol is teratogenic , and a safe dose is uncertain and controversial .\nThe FDA

people and kept many prisoners in their own homes for 18 months , whilst the elderly in care homes were refused visits from family and loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has just announced a U-turn of policies and relaxed certain laws of covid restrictions .\nSo why now ?\nIs this the \u201c return to normal \u201d that so many have been waiting for ?\nOriginally anyone with suspected coronavirus , or anyone in contact with them had to stay at home for 10 days .\nThat was recently reduced to seven days , and this week went down to five days \u2013 although experts say a third of people who have Covid will still be infectious after five days .\nThe prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmed the intention to end the legal requirement to self-isolate in the coming weeks .\nThe self-isolation regulations expire on March 24 2022 , but could be brought forward if data allows .\nMr Johnson said he expected not to renew the regulations in a new relaxed stance against restrictions .\nScientists believe the Omicron

school pupils will no longer have to wear face masks in classrooms Further announcements on the easing of travel rules and restrictions on care home visits in England are expected in the coming days , Boris Johnson also added .\nWhilst similar announcements have been made in Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland , after all four nations of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases .\nSome may say this is job done .\nBut other statistics tell a different story .\nIt \u2019 s of no doubt the vaccine campaign in the UK and other western countries has been a roaring success .\nThe uptake has been huge , with a staggering 80 % of the British population now double vaccinated .\nAs opposed to countries such as Bulgaria , where the vaccine uptake is as low as 20 % the government there is still forcing vaccine passes and closing schools .\nWhilst Austria is set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens in a bid to increase their vaccination rates .\nAs we reported earlier this month and all along , German data suggests that these very vaccines are themselves the cause of long-term irreparable damage to your immune system .\nAs even the UK government \u2019 s own research now shows , once you have been double-vaccinated you will never again be able to acquire full natural immunity to any Covid variant \u2013 or even more concerning , possibly any other virus .\nAnd there are trillions out there that we are exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the untested vaccine race now started the real pandemic that we have all been fearing ?\nIn its Week 42 \u201c COVID-19 Vaccine Surveillance Report \u201d , the UK Department of Health admits ( page 23 ) that \u201c N antibody levels appear to be lower in people who become infected after two doses of vaccination \u201d .\nIt goes on to say that this drop in antibodies is essentially permanent and that vaccinated people are more likely to be infected than the unvaccinated .\nOnce again proving that vaccines work against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body \u2019 s own natural process of making antibodies after an infection has occurred , not only against the spike protein , but also against other parts of the virus .\nVaccinated people do not appear to form antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein , the envelope of the virus , which is a crucial part of the response to combatting the disease AND are also far more susceptible to any mutations in the spike protein , even if they have already been infected and cured once or more .\nFor unvaccinated healthy people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immune system will work as it is intended and gain lasting , if not permanent , immunity to all strains of any virus , after being naturally exposed to it , or infected with it .\nAnd it \u2019 s not like we were not warned this could happen , as we reported back in March last year , vaccine expert Geert Vanden Bossche , PhD said the vaccines themselves were set to be a major threat to public health .\n\u201c Fact is there are long lived antibodies which have high specificity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our natural anti bodies because [ we have ] natural antibodies [ with ] a very broad spectrum , but low affinity\u2026 And that is a huge problem because these natural antibodies provide you with protection .\nThis protection is variant non-specific .\nThis doesn \u2019 t matter what variant you get , it doesn \u2019 t even matter what type of coronavirus is coming in .\nThey protect you\u2026 Unless of course you suppress this level of immunity , or it is for example out competed by long lived specific antibodies.\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are now seeing industry reverse tactics , as the first insurance companies are starting to back down in the face of a huge wave of claims against vaccine manufacturers .\nWhilst , in the USA Anthony Fauci confirms that the PCR test can not even detect live viruses and that neither the antigen test , nor the PCR test can tell us whether someone is contagious or not !\n!\n!\nSo if the tests are invalid , so the numbers are also very much effected , thus invalidating the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSince the PCR tests were the only known indicators of a pandemic .\nWithout the PCR-TESTs there is no pandemic !\n!\n\u201c Some are likely to feel more than ready to cast aside restrictions that have been financially and personal inconveniences , while others may fear things are moving too quickly and that it is now that we must show caution .\nRegardless of the range of attitudes , changing the rules will shift behaviour .\nThe research so far has shown that it has been rules that have been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Prof Robert West , a behavioural scientist at University College London ( UCL ) .\nWest points to a steady decline in the number of people adhering to advice to wear masks once it is not longer a requirement .\n\u201c People still said they thought it was a good idea , but fewer and fewer people were actually doing it.\n\u201d So why now are the rules relaxing ?\nIs it in fact a far more sinister move to relax the restrictions on a people that are now actually far more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called \u201c pandemic \u201d than ever before ?\nAs everyone lined up for the antidote and resulting miracle cure , is it this very cure that could cause the most long-term damage and destruction .\nDoes this government backed data not suggest that it is actually now that people should be social distancing , wearing masks and showing more caution ?\nOnly time will tell if death rates continue to rise , but this new overall trend appears to be the most alarming of all , if not surprising to some , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most

a strong statement , but anyone who carefully examines the science behind VDTP/GCMAF , Nagalase , and the molecular biology of macrophage activation will realize it is true .\nMany people are going to want to purchase genuine VDTP/GCMAF .\nUnfortunately genuine VDTP/GCMAF is only available from the below companies : This book has two primary goals , both of which are attainable .\nThe first is to further the cause of making VDTP/GCMAF available to all who need it .\nThe second is to promote the establishment of Nagalase cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high risk populations .\nWith Nagalase testing we now possess the technology to identify cancer when it is just a handful of cells and then easily reverse it with a few VDTP/GCMAF injections .\nFor me , the Holy Grail of cancer eradication is finding it early and nipping it in the bud .\nRoutine Nagalase testing finds cancer early and VDTP/GCMAF can then deal with the cancer .\nIf we can accelerate research on Nagalase testing and VDTP/GCMAF treatment , the following conversations might happen five years from now : Joe has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family doctor for the past two decades , to discuss Joe \u2019 s annual lab test results .\n\u201c Hi Joe .\nGood to see you !\n\u201d says Dr. Jones .\n\u201c We ran some screening tests on your blood and I \u2019 ve got some good news and some bad news.\n\u201d \u201c It \u2019 s been a long day , doc .\nHow about the good news first , if you don \u2019 t mind , \u201d says Joe .\n\u201c Sure .\nYour blood tests tell me you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other heart markers are all normal .\nYour vitamin D level is excellent at 70 .\nYour PSA is low .\nYour thyroid is in balance .\nYour complete blood count and other metabolic parameters are perfect.\n\u201d \u201c Sounds good , doc , and that all fits perfectly with the fact that I feel great !\n\u2026so what \u2019 s the bad news ?\n\u201d \u201c \u201c Well , Joe , your Nagalase level is elevated .\nand that \u2019 s got me a little concerned.\n\u201d \u201c My Nagalase is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does that mean ?\n\u201d says Joe cautiously .\n\u201c Nagalase\u2014short for alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase\u2014is an enzyme made by viruses and cancer cells .\nWe can test for it .\nAn elevated level tells me you have the very earliest beginnings of either a cancer or a virus .\nNagalase testing is a lot like cholesterol testing .\nElevated cholesterol is associated with increased risk of arterial plaque and heart attack .\nAn elevated Nagalase tells us you are at increased risk of cancer .\n\u201c Cancer or virus ?\nI don \u2019 t understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\n\u201d \u201c Both cancers and viruses make Nagalase , and at this point I can \u2019 t tell you which it is .\nBut there \u2019 s nothing to worry about here , Joe .\nYou don \u2019 t have any symptoms , so it probably isn \u2019 t a virus .\nWe \u2019 ll get some antibody tests to rule out that possibility , and we \u2019 ll repeat your Nagalase level to see whether it is going up or not .\nFor now , all we need to do is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elevation is caused by a virus , the level will go back down .\nIf the elevated Nagalase is caused by an early cancer , the Nagalase will keep going up , and we \u2019 ll treat it and make it go away .\nHere \u2019 s your lab order .\nSee you in a month , okay ?\n\u201d \u201c I might have cancer , but not to worry ?\nHow does that work ?\n\u201d \u201c Five years ago , Joe , I \u2019 d be very concerned .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nagalase testing for detecting early cancers , so I wouldn \u2019 t have even known that a cancer was getting started in you .\nAt least not until it got a lot bigger .\nAnd five years ago , if I did have some way to know you had early cancer , I wouldn \u2019 t have had a way to reverse it .\nNow , I have both .\nAnd I must tell you , as a doctor who has seen a lot of people suffer and die from cancer , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now available .\nMillions of olives have already been saved by catching cancers early and reversing them before they got out of control .\nSo , not to worry , Joe .\nIf it \u2019 s cancer , we have the tools to get rid of it .\nSee you in a month.\n\u201d \u201c Joe , your viral antibody tests all came back normal , so now we know you don \u2019 t have a viral infection .\nYour Nagalase , however , continues to climb higher .\nThat tells me you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing in you somewhere.\n\u201d \u201c I \u2019 ve got cancer ?\nYikes !\nYou did tell me this was a possibility .\nNow should I be worried ?\n\u201d \u201c No , Joe , you really have nothing to worry about .\nWe have a treatment that will make this cancer go away .\nAnd we can accomplish that long before it gets big enough to show up on a CAT scan.\n\u201d \u201c Does it matter what kind of cancer it is ?\n\u201d \u201c Does it matter where it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get a CAT scan so we can find it ?\n\u201d \u201c Since your Nagalase is only slightly elevated , I know that your cancer \u2019 s still way too small to see on imaging .\nBut the cancer cells are definitely in there , making the Nagalase that we see on your blood test.\n\u201d Couldn \u2019 t there be something else that \u2019 s making the Nagalase ?\n\u201d says Joe .\n\u201c No , Nagalase is only made by cancers and viruses , and we \u2019 ve eliminated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to be cancer.\n\u201d \u201c How soon can we start treating it ?\n\u201d \u201c In one month .\nI want to get a third Nagalase level , just to make sure\u2014and if it is still going up , then we can be certain it is cancer , and we \u2019 ll start the treatment.\n\u201d \u201c Well , Joe , your Nagalase is still climbing , so we can start treatment today.\n\u201d \u201c Okay .\nWhat do we do ?\nWhat is the treatment ?\n\u201d \u201c Weekly injections of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measuring your Nagalase once a month , and when it gets back down to normal , we \u2019 ll know the cancer has been cured , so that \u2019 s when we \u2019 ll stop giving you the shots.\n\u201d \u201c Usually three to six months.\n\u201d \u201c VDTP/GCMAF \u2014group specific component macrophage activating factor\u2014is the protein your body makes to activate your anti-cancer immune activity\u2026 \u201c Joe , your immune system contains some very large cells called macrophages that , when activated , will track down , attack , devour , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2014an immune protein made by your lymphocytes\u2014is what literally turns them on .\nWithout VDTP/GCMAF , your macrophages remain in a state of suspended animation\u2014sort of like zombies.\n\u201d \u201c You mean if I don \u2019 t have enough VDTP/GCMAF they stop killing off the invaders ?\nThat can \u2019 t be good.\n\u201d \u201c No , it isn \u2019 t , Joe .\nThis is not a subtle slowdown , either .\nIn terms of killing power , an activated macrophage is about 40 times more aggressive than a de-activated macrophage .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep.\n\u201d \u201c Your cancer cells have figured out that if they block the production of VDTP/GCMAF , they can disable their archenemies , the macrophages , and get the upper hand .\nWithout VDTP/GCMAF to activate them , the macrophages don \u2019 t have a chance.\n\u201d \u201c So , doc , how did they do it ?\nHow did my cancer cells disable my macrophages.\n\u201d \u201c Yup .\nNagalase blocks VDTP/GCMAF production , so when we see a rising Nagalase , we pay very close attention .\nIt is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us cancer is on the move .\nAs cancers grow , they generate more and more Nagalase.\n\u201d \u201c So the rising Nagalase numbers told you my cancer cells were winning the war.\n\u201d \u201c And that the Nagalase had put my macrophages to sleep by blocking my body \u2019 s VDTP/GCMAF production.\n\u201d \u201c Right .\nThere may be a future for you in molecular biology , Joe.\n\u201d \u201c So how do we re-/activate my macrophages so they get back to work destroying my cancer cells ?\n\u201d \u201c By giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bypass the production blockage caused by the Nagalase.\n\u201d \u201c Makes sense to me .\nHow big are these shots , doc ?\n\u201d \u201c They \u2019 re incredibly small .\nJust 100 nanograms\u2014that \u2019 s 100 billionths of a gram , dissolved in a few drops of water .\nIn fact , if you removed the water , the VDTP/GCMAF alone would be too small to see.\n\u201d \u201c In early cases like yours , Joe , it works every time .\nThat \u2019 s why we like to catch it while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screening.\n\u201d \u201c So you are going to give me some VDTP/GCMAF shots that \u2019 ll perk up my macrophages so they can get back to work finding and gobbling up these cancer cells , right ?\n\u201d \u201c Right .\nNow , please roll up your sleeve.\n\u201d VDTP/GCMAF is the protein that activates macrophages and jump-starts the entire immune response .\nTo sabotage the immune system and put the macrophages to sleep , all cancers and viruses make Nagalese , the enzyme that blocks production of VDTP/GCMAF .\nIn the absence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other viruses can grow unimpeded .\nDr. Nobuto Yamamoto demonstrated that VDTP/GCMAF administration bypasses the Nagalese blockage and re-activates the macrophages , which then proceed to kill the cancer cells and HIV viruses .\n\u201c Good to see you .\nAs you already know , we had found that small breast cancer on your mammogram , and Dr. Humphrey has already taken it out.\n\u201d \u201c As you also know , I got a Nagalase level before the lumpectomy , and then again after surgery , and then monthly levels since .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportional to the amount of cancer in your body , it really helps me to track your cancer and make sure it doesn \u2019 t get out of control.\n\u201d \u201c Yes , and remember how high it was right before my surgery ?\nThen , right after the surgery , it dropped a lot , because there was less cancer to make the Nagalase .\nBut it was still elevated after the lump was taken out , so we knew there still had to be some cancer left behind after the surgery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nagalase started climbing again , so we knew the cancer , wherever it was\u2014was growing .\nThat part was pretty depressing , doc !\nThat \u2019 s why you started me on the VDTP/GCMAF , right ?\n\u201c Yes .\nAnd as you know , Mary , we \u2019 ve been testing your Nagalase levels monthly since we started the VDTP/GCMAF shots , and it has been gradually coming back down .\nThis told me that the VDTP/GCMAF was activating your immune system and that your macrophages\u2014if you \u2019 ll excuse the expression\u2014were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells.\n\u201d \u201c I \u2019 ve got some really good news for you today , Mary .\nYour Nagalase level has finally , after 20 weeks of injections , reached zero .\nYou are now officially cancer-free , so we can stop the injections .\nAnd we can celebrate !\nIf you don \u2019 t mind my saying so , YIPPEE !\n!\n!\n\u201c Wow !\nThat \u2019 s incredible .\nYou know , Doc , I might have been dead right now if it weren \u2019 t for you \u2026and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary , it is sincerely my pleasure.\n\u201d Can it be true ?\nA cure for early metastatic cancer and HIV that appears to work 100 % of the time\u2014that almost nobody knows about ?\nMy search for answers .\nSolving the riddle of VDTP/GCMAF .\nWhy VDTP/GCMAF remains obscure .\nPlease don \u2019 t be intimidated by cell biology !\nThe war analogy .\nOn November 19 , 2008 something touched my life and changed it forever .\nI had just completed my second book , Outsmarting The Number One Killer ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart attacks and strokes ) when I came across three seminal studies published earlier that year by internationally recognized research immunologist and molecular biologist , Nobuto Yamamoto , Ph.D .\nThese pivotal papers\u2014which will , I believe , change the course of medical history\u2014blew me away : Yamamoto had apparently discovered a way to \u201c outsmart \u201d cancer , and was using the body \u2019 s own natural healing systems to do it .\n\u201c Holy cow !\n!\n!\n\u201d I said to myself ( using a word that \u2019 s less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This guy has discovered a cure for early metastatic cancer that appears to work 100 % of the time !\n!\n!\n\u201d And this was no \u201c black box \u201d model or statistical study ( you know , the kind that make observations but don \u2019 t address underlying causal mechanisms .\nMedicine A cures disease B , but nothing about how it actually works ) .\nAll the basic science , all the necessary molecular biological information\u2014an impressive display of published research studies from a quarter century of work\u2014was right there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mirrors .\nAnyone who has perused Dr. Yamamoto \u2019 s research papers would have to agree he published an impressively extensive series of serious science masterpieces .\nAs I learned more I became committed to bringing this powerful new set of ideas into public awareness .\nIt became clear to me that we need to find a way to make VDTP/GCMAF available to all cancer , HIV , and chronic virus patients , and we need to institute routine annual Nagalase testing to find cancers much earlier than imaging now allows .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ by regular Nagalase testing , we could reverse them with VDTP/GCMAF \u2014long before X-rays could find them\u2014and put cancer out of business once and for all .\nThis may seem like a rash statement , but I believe it is supported by the facts .\nYamamoto \u2019 s three studies showed that incredibly small weekly doses ( 100 billionths of a gram\u2014an amount that is invisible to the naked eye ) of VDTP/GCMAF had cured early metastatic breast , prostate , and colon cancers in 100 % of ( nonanemic ) patients .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same treatment to cure 100 % of nonanemic HIV-infected patients .\nFor the three cancer studies , Dr. Yamamoto had chosen patients who had recently received the standard mainstream triad of surgery , chemo , and radiation .\nDespite these treatments , every patient had evidence of metastatic disease , which means that despite the best efforts of conventional medicine , their cancers were out of control and still growing .\nTheir prognoses were poor at best .\nNevertheless , this patient group had one thing in common : their tumor mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been drastically reduced by the therapies they had received , and this in turn dramatically increased the likelihood that VDTP/GCMAF would remove the few remaining cancer cells .\nThese studies underscore the importance of the unique circumstance in which VDTP/GCMAF is most likely to be effective : very low tumor burden .\nLow tumor burden occurs in just two situations .\nThe first is the earliest stage of any cancer , when the number of cancer cells is still very small .\nThe second is immediately after a diagnosed tumor has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which prevailed in Dr. Yamamoto \u2019 s studies .\nConversely , the situation in which VDTP/GCMAF is least likely to be effective is when there is a large number of tumor cells .\nAlthough results will vary greatly from one patient to another and further study is needed , clinical research experience to date suggests that tumors larger than one cm .\nin diameter are unlikely to respond to VDTP/GCMAF therapy .\n( See Chapter 18 : \u2018 The Cancer continuum and the Point of no return \u2019 _ ) Curing metastatic cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yamamoto discovered and administered VDTP/GCMAF , no one had ever cured every single case .\nThese are the patients oncologists give up on , the ones that get \u201c palliative \u201d care .\nPerhaps another round or two of chemo or radiation in the slim hopes of a long-term reversal or a little extra ( probably not very high quality ) time\u2014but with metastatic disease there is no serious expectation of an actual cure .\nThe numbers are profoundly dismal .\nGranted , all of Yamamoto \u2019 s patients were in the earliest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortly after the Big Three had failed .\nFor these patients ( though a sprinkling might have been saved by additional radiation and/or chemo ) , the assumption would usually be that their cancers would grow and eventually kill them .\nVDTP/GCMAF , remarkably , saved every single one .\nThis is an exceptional outcome and deserves greater scrutiny that it has received .\nA fourth study , published in January of 2009 , showed Yamamoto\u2014using the same treatment protocol\u2014had removed all signs of viral activity in 100 % of HIV infected patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within 18 weeks .\nRemarkably , Yamamoto accomplished these cures relatively rapidly .\nThe breast and prostate cancer patients were all cured in less than 6 months of weekly VDTP/GCMAF injections .\nThe colorectal cancer study took about a year to cure all subjects .\nFive to seven years of careful followup revealed no recurrences in any of the patients .\nAnyone who is familiar with cancer research would have to find this remarkable .\nThis was not a \u201c one off , \u201d a \u201c lucky strike.\n\u201d Yamamoto \u2019 s four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trailblazing research in which he had already proven\u2014via basic science and animal studies\u2014exactly how VDTP/GCMAF and Nagalase work .\nThe 2008 human trials were just the frosting on a phenomenal cake that took a quarter century to bake .\nThe breadth and depth of the underlying research is important here because misinformed critics whine about VDTP/GCMAF being \u201c unproved.\n\u201d Had these naysayers read the dozens of Yamamoto papers published in peer-reviewed journals between 1979 and 2008 that lay down an unimpeachable foundation for his final proof ?\nI doubt it .\nWhen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I couldn \u2019 t believe it either .\nA cure for early stage metastatic cancer that \u2019 s effective in every single case ?\nAbsurd .\nPublished in peer-reviewed journals ?\nNo way .\nI figured there must be some hitch , a mistake , a logical error , a weak link , a fatal flaw , and I was determined to find it , but the deeper I delved the more convinced I became that VDTP/GCMAF was for real !\nThen I started wondering why I seemed to be among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At first , I spent a huge amount of time enhancing my understanding of the relevant molecular biology , genetics , and immunology .\nI learned a lot more than I ever thought I would about cancer , macrophages , oxidative bursts , adhesion molecules , antibodies , phagocytosis , protein chemistry , cytokines , messenger molecules , receptors , N-acetyl-galactosaminidase ( Nagalase ) , and VDTP/GCMAF .\nAt times I felt as if I had stuffed so much new information into my head that it was going to explode .\nI needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how all the pieces fit together .\nI poured over research articles and molecular genetics texts until I felt I had a reasonable grasp of what Yamamoto was doing and saying .\nI developed the ability to visualize\u2014in great detail\u2014the workings of macrophages battling cancer cells and viruses in this brutal microscopic cannibalistic war .\nThe more I learned the more it sunk in : using impeccable science , Yamamoto had found a powerful means of enhancing our bodies \u2019 own anti-cancer , anti-viral weaponry !\nThat \u2019 s what cured the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more I asked the question : why had the medical community\u2014much less the average person\u2014never heard of VDTP/GCMAF ?\nNo article in the print media .\nNo video , no book , no research articles other than Yamamoto \u2019 s .\nNo serious scientific web discussions ( which is truly extraordinary , because everything is on the internet ) .\nNo nothing .\nGoogling on VDTP/GCMAF does generate some hits , but nothing substantial , no serious science beyond Nobuto Yamamoto \u2019 s own original papers .\n\u201c Hmmm .\nThis is truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I turned to what I call \u201c human browsers.\n\u201d I called a bunch of my physician buddies and molecular biology colleagues\u2014good scientists all\u2014but there , too , I drew a blank every single time .\nNot a single one of them had ever heard of VDTP/GCMAF .\nNot easily dissuaded , I contacted several immunology researchers at major institutions , and again no one had heard of VDTP/GCMAF .\nMaybe someone in the government or research establishments , the FDA ( Food and Drug Administration ) , the NCI ( National Cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institutes of Health ) , American Cancer Society ( ACS ) knew something ?\nNope .\nNo one there had ever heard of it either .\n( Or if they had , they sure weren \u2019 t talking . )\nIn those early months , my level of frustration gradually escalated .\nProof of a natural cure for advanced ( metastatic ) cancer ( not to mention HIV and other chronic viral infections ) and nobody seemed interested ?\nI just couldn \u2019 t understand it .\nFinally , a sense of surrealism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hours on this , with literally nothing to show for it .\nNobody knew anything .\nAnd when I tried to explain Yamamoto \u2019 s work to some of the people I called , I could hear their eyes were glazing over .\nI could hear them thinking , \u201c C \u2019 mon now , doc .\nA cure for all cancers ?\nOh , sure .\nOne that works 100 % of the time ?\nOn metastatic cancer ?\nGive me a break .\nIt sounds like smoke and mirrors to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on reality .\nNo Oprah ?\nNo Larry King ?\nNo New York Times article ?\nNo article anywhere ?\nNo media coverage of any kind !\nNo scientific recognition ?\nWhat the heck is going on here ?\nAfter writing an entire book on the subject , I can still honestly say I don \u2019 t know why the average person\u2014not to mention the average physician or the average molecular biologist\u2014has never heard of VDTP/GCMAY It seems to me that that should have happened a long time ago .\nI hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass we need to overcome the obstacles .\nSo : Hello out there !\nHere \u2019 s a cure for cancer and AIDS !\n!\n!\nEven more significantly , here \u2019 s a way to rid the planet of the scourge of cancer .\nI am passing on what I have learned about it to enable you to chip in and work with me to transform VDTP/GCMAF from a set of abstract concepts to a lifesaving reality .\nMillions upon millions of lives would be saved if we could make VDTP/GCMAF \u2014a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and HIV patients who desperately need it .\nAnd countless cancers would be prevented using Nagalase screening and VDTP/GCMAF therapy on all adult human populations .\nPlease help !\nThis is a two-way street .\nI \u2019 ve chosen a reader-editable format ( actually , truth be known , my web genius friend and cyberguru , created it specifically for this book ) whereby anyone who is interested can contribute their ideas .\nThe beauty of this approach is that it facilitates collective development of ideas by an organized community .\nIn sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a process that has the potential to help a lot of your fellow humans and to alleviate a huge amount of suffering .\nAnd\u2014as if that weren \u2019 t enough of a reward\u2014 you \u2019 ll also ( if you so desire ) be listed in the Acknowledgments .\nHere are a few key facts that provide a partial answer to the fascinating question : Why has VDTP/GCMAF gone unnoticed ?\n\u2022 Understanding Yamamoto \u2019 s work requires a firm grasp of some pretty advanced molecular biology , which most people\u2014even most doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s kind of a language problem : if someone shouts \u201c Cancer Cure !\n!\n!\nCancer Cure !\n!\n!\nCancer Cure !\n!\n!\n\u201d in Swahili , it is quite possible that earthshatteringness of it all won \u2019 t get through , and everyone will go on about their business as if nothing happened .\n( In this book I have translated these ideas into everyday language .\nIt \u2019 s not that complicated . )\n\u2022 To a stodgy medical community that \u2019 s resistant to change , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d And an \u201c alternative \u201d one at that .\nUnproved therapies are not to be trusted .\n( Even if they \u2019 re harmless and bioidentical . )\n\u2022 \u201c Proving \u201d this discovery the conventional way would involve developing and promoting a lucrative drug .\nDoing that takes about a decade and costs over 100 million dollars .\nBeyond time and money , it requires a lot of biochemical know-how and some sophisticated equipment .\nBrewing it up in your basement lab with a chemistry set and a bunch of buddies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a motivated pharmaceutical company could do it overnight .\n\u2022 Big Pharma isn \u2019 t interested because there \u2019 s no cash cow at the end of this rainbow .\nVDTP/GCMAF \u2014like all chemicals our body is programmed to make\u2014can \u2019 t be patented because it fits the FDA \u2019 s definition of \u201c natural \u201d ( translation : \u201c unpatentable \u201d ) .\nWe are thus confronted with the supreme pickle : is it possible to conduct open-minded , non-profit driven research in an era of corporatized and politicized medical science ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ science was done for the sake of science .\nIt wasn \u2019 t that long ago . )\n\u2022 The cancer industry does not really want cancer to go away .\nThis may seem harsh , but it \u2019 s true .\nMany incomes would be interrupted if cancer and HIV suddenly ceased to exist .\nGovernment agencies would have to be closed , oncologists would have to be retrained , researchers redirected , cancer treatment centers shut down or converted to screening and prevention facilities\u2014and that \u2019 s just the tip of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profound social upheaval here .\nCancer is entrenched and institutionalized , and vanquishing it would cause major fireworks .\nThese fears are largely unfounded , however .\nFor optimum effectiveness , VDTP/GCMAF and Nagalase testing will need to be integrated into the existing cancer care system , so we need the system .\n\u2022 To understand VDTP/GCMAF and Nagalase we must embrace an entirely new model\u2014a completely different approach to cancer and chronic viral infections .\nThere is no super drug , no magic bullet .\nOur bodies already know how to cure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to enhance these systems using natural medicines .\nThat \u2019 s how VDTP/GCMAF works .\nThe scientific community , however , is deeply resistant to the idea of natural medicines bolstering the immune system .\n\u2022 If we are going to commit to stopping these epidemics our new direction must be annual screening ( with Nagalase or AMAS testing ) for early detection , then nipping cancer in the bud with VDTP/GCMAF .\nThe old \u201c wait until its gotten so big we can see it on imaging and then slash and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to go .\nA couple \u201c brief asides \u201d here , and then\u2014in the next chapter\u2014we \u2019 ll get into how VDTP/GCMAF works .\nPlease don \u2019 t be intimidated by cell biology !\nTo the outsider , the world of molecular biology and biochemistry may seem bewildering and the language we use to describe cellular events often appears foreign and incomprehensible .\nJust because we use inscrutably complex words like glycoprotein macrophage activating factor ( VDTP/GCMAF ) or alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase ( Nagalase ) doesn \u2019 t mean the concepts are inaccessible .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t be intimidated : this material is not as complicated as it might seem .\nMy self-imposed job description has been to translate this arcane , esoteric , imposing , and highly technical science into concepts that are easily understood by the lay person\u2014and , in the process , to bring it to life .\nIf you find the material hard to understand , I have failed at that task .\nThe war analogy : I use it because it works For the same reason that language is the most popular and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have chosen the war analogy to depict the nano-scale drama that unfolds on the immunological battlefield : it works .\nPlease don \u2019 t think that this means I am pro-war .\nQuite the opposite .\nI think most wars are bad and stupid , and I detest them .\nThough I believe that some wars have been justified ( a recent example would be World War II , in which control of the planet by despots was at stake ) , I am one who is hopeful that members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things out without resorting to needless slaughter .\nWe will have reached a high point in our evolution when we learn to put war behind us once and for all .\nSpeaking as a humanoid member of a cell-based life form , however , it is crucial to acknowledge the necessity of this inner war against cancer and microbes , those evil forces that are out to destroy us .\nPacifism won \u2019 t work here ; we really have no choice but to fight back or die .\nThere are three kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are many many kinds of research studies , but for the purpose of this article , I \u2019 m making it three . )\nFirst , there \u2019 s what I will call \u201c black box \u201d studies .\nIn these , you try something out on experimental subjects and see what happens .\nThe actual internal mechanisms driving the results are not necessarily known : \u201c Oh , when we fed the rats mushrooms and green tea , some of their cancers went away.\n\u201d Interesting and useful outcomes , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are population studies in which ( not necessarily accurate ) conclusions are drawn from statistical studies involving large groups of people : \u201c We found that 50 % of people who had heart attacks had normal cholesterol levels .\nWe therefore conclude that\u2026 \u201d Again , underlying causative mechanisms are not part of the picture .\nWith both black box research and statistical studies , the importance of cause and effect are effectively dismissed : the underlying cause of an observed effect is never known .\nThis is a fundamental flaw ; we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get from black box and statistical studies because they don \u2019 t address causality .\nFor this reason , I pay very little attention to these first two kinds of research studies .\nThe third type of research is basic science , where ideas are developed and tested from the ground up .\nInsights gained in one study become the driving force for designing the next one .\nProfessor Nobuto Yamamoto did\u2014and still does\u2014basic science research .\nHe spent a quarter of a century examining\u2014in minute detail\u2014the basic molecular biology and immunology supporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and glycoprotein macrophage activating factor ( VDTP/GCMAF ) .\nThere \u2019 s no black box , no statistics , just a complex trail of experimental insights that collectively form a colossal infrastructure upon which his final conclusions are based .\nHe didn \u2019 t try out a new , unknown and potentially toxic drug on a bunch of people ; he did the basic science research and figured out\u2014exactly , precisely , down to the submolecular level\u2014how cancer breaks our bodies , and then he showed how to fix it using the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tool .\nIt \u2019 s a brilliant , Herculean , masterpiece of work , and Dr. Yamamoto deserves a Nobel Prize for his efforts .\nHe also deserves to have his ideas widely understood and taken seriously\u2014an outcome that has not yet happened .\nDr. Yamamoto is healthy and active at age 84 .\nI feel that for him the best reward of all would be to see , in his own lifetime , the world \u2019 s cancer and HIV patients benefit from his work .\nYour immune army uses an amazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer and microbes .\nThere are good guys ( our white blood cells ) and bad guys ( cancer and microorganisms ) in us , and they are fighting it out for control of the territory that is you .\nI am going to put you in front of a very powerful microscope so you can see\u2014in vivid detail\u2014this constant vicious struggle going on inside every one of us .\nThe opposing armies conduct complex military maneuvers and deploy a fantastic and unimaginably small array of war machinery , all coordinated by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign invaders\u2014are constantly attacking us ; I speak of allergens , infectious agents , various toxins , and cancer .\nOur immune army , our guardian , is comprised of dozens of cell types with hundreds of different functions .\nIn any single person , immune cells number in the hundreds of billions\u2014several times more then the number of stars in our galaxy or galaxies in our universe !\nThey routinely sacrifice their teeny ( but incredibly complex ) lives to defend us .\nHealthy immune cells are essential to our survival in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relentless in their pursuit of cancer and other foreign invaders .\nWhen activated , they make Hitler , Stalin , and Mao look like neighborhood bullies .\nImmune cells attack in extremely large numbers\u2014far larger than any army ever .\nCome to think of it , every single human has far more immune warriors than all the armies in history put together .\nTheir onslaught is superbly coordinated by an extremely sophisticated communication and command system ; human military intelligence operations are kindergarten games in comparison .\nUsing a complex language comprised of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cytokines , cell-signaling molecules , neurotransmitters , etc . )\n, your immune cell soldiers release a barrage of chemical messages that identify foreign invaders , provide their location , estimate numbers , and coordinate the attack .\nMacrophage engulfs and phagocytizes a cancer cell .\nFrom \u201c The Immune System \u201d published by The Upjohn Company .\nAnd what an awesome attack !\nOur immune cells sport an arsenal that would make Star Wars look puny .\nImmune cells can blow up enemy invaders .\nThey can shoot out beams of ionized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outer cell membranes of infectious microbes and cancer cells .\nThey release spurts of corrosive chemical poisons .\nThey surround , cannibalize , and digest enemy cells\u2014and then recycle the parts .\nThey launch guided missiles from great distances that land and explode with incredible precision .\nThey even smother their enemies in sticky goo ( called complement ) like the Marshmallow Man in Ghostbusters .\nYour immune army deploys these remarkable weapons in multiple wars on several fronts .\nThe skin , respiratory system , intestinal tract and bloodstream sustain the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells .\nOur largest exposure to pathogens\u2014by far\u2014is in the gut .\nBecause this is the largest and most frequently breached barrier , roughly 80 % of your white blood cells are embedded just beneath the intestinal mucosal surface .\nMicrobes\u2014in the form of bacteria , fungi , parasites , viruses , and the occasional helminth \u2014are persistently knocking on the door and must be fended off on a non-stop basis .\nAs you will see , we fend with some pretty big sticks .\nImagine an army with hundreds of billions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take on cancer cells , viruses , and bacteria mano a mano in a struggle to the death .\nCancer cells are forming continuously in all of us , but alert , activated ( you \u2019 ll soon see why I italicize this word ) immune cells will give them the instantaneous hatchet .\nIf your constantly vigilant and aggressively protective immune system took a coffee break , you \u2019 d be dead by the time it was over .\nI am going to tell you a lot more about the wondrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside of us .\nBut first , let \u2019 s take a look at the \u201c big picture , \u201d an overview of our \u201c War on Cancer.\n\u201d 4 : The War on Cancer Inside Us Cancer is a war waged on a submicroscopic molecular scale .\nTaking a keen interest in this war wouldn \u2019 t be a bad idea , as its outcome will eventually determine whether about a third of us will live or die .\nThe advent of Nagalase testing and VDTP/GCMAF therapy gives us reason to hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the specter of cancer .\nThere \u2019 ll be problems along the way .\nCancer is many things to many people .\nFrom the point of view of the cancer patient , cancer may be seen as a fear-inducing , life-threatening nightmare .\nFrom the perspective of a family member , who may be called upon to provide emotional , physical , and/or financial support , how could cancer be anything other than stressful ?\nFrom the viewpoint of the doctor , who must find and treat the cancer to the best of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both a backbreaking , sometimes thankless , job and an opportunity to provide exceptional , loving patient care .\nThe molecular biologist , however , views cancer as a vicious and protracted battle waged between cancer cells and immune cells .\nThis cancer war\u2014a strategic dance of cellular activities\u2014is breathtaking in its elegance and sophistication .\nTwo cell types\u2014cancer cells and macrophages\u2014comprise the main forces of the opposing armies .\nBoth have massive numbers of personnel and awesome weaponry at their disposal , and both have a strategy for winning .\nRemember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells are genetically programmed to survive and spread .\nOn the other side our immune system consists of enormous numbers of crafty white blood cells doing their best to defend us .\nTaking a keen interest in this war wouldn \u2019 t be a bad idea , as its outcome will eventually determine whether about a third of us will live or die .\nHundreds of billions of cellular warriors on both sides will die before it \u2019 s all over .\nThe stakes don \u2019 t get much higher .\nIf the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will cease to exist .\nVDTP/GCMAF treatment and Nagalase testing will dramatically change the way this war is fought .\nWith some hard work and perhaps a few lucky breaks , we now have reason to hope\u2014and even expect\u2014that we can eradicate cancer .\nNot just in our lifetimes , but in the next few years .\nWhen I said \u201c a few lucky breaks \u201d above , I was referring to our medical care delivery system , including the federal government , Big Pharma , insurance companies , cancer care facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reasons\u2014including but not limited to the flow of cash\u2014this gargantuan beast resists change .\nVDTP/GCMAF and Nagalase are the two new elephants in the room .\nAccepting that these benevolent behemoths have moved in for good\u2014and making space for them within our current cancer care system\u2014is going to be the challenge of the century .\nPeople will continue to die because of the reluctance of modern medicine to embrace change .\nIf we started screening everyone for elevated Nagalase today , and giving VDTP/GCMAF to those with high levels , we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the rubble would be some some very unhappy drug salesmen and more than one bored but retrainable oncologist with an overdue Mercedes payment .\nAbout the nano-scale war fought inside us .\nSome important features of cancer cells .\nIt \u2019 s the cancer army vs our immune army .\nHow macros tell friend from foe .\nMacrophages are the ultimate fighting machine , but they \u2019 re naturally indolent and remain idle without VDTP/GCMAF activation .\nNagalase , made by cancer cells and viruses , puts macrophages to sleep by blocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain comatose .\nVDTP/GCMAF injections bypass Nagalase , re-activate the macros , and this jump-starts the entire immune system .\nCancers are made up of cells that carry damaged genes .\nThese cells have stopped cooperating with the rest of the cellular community , and are growing out of control .\nOnce a useful part of us , and still harboring our genome , these deranged cells have now mutated into our archenemy , hell-bent on destroying us .\nLeft to their own devices\u2014they will .\nThey grow , forming an isolated local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis tumor can eventually send its cells through the bloodstream ( we call this metastasis ) to establish satellite communities at remote locations in other organs .\nThe disease we call cancer is actually a nano-scale war fought in each of us every moment of every day .\nWe now know that we are all developing cancer cells all of the time , but that a healthy immune system devours them as fast as they are made .\nAnything that weakens the immune system can shift that delicate balance in favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2022 Cancer cells don \u2019 t stop reproducing \u2013 Unlike normal cells , cancer cells do not stop reproducing after they have doubled 50 or 60 times .\nThis means that a cancer cell will go on and on and on doubling .\nSo one cell becomes 2 , then 4 , then 8 , then 16 .\nThe cancer cells may be able to stop themselves self -destructing .\nOr they may self -destruct more slowly than they reproduce , so that their numbers continue to increase .\nEventually a tumor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of copies of the original cancerous cell .\nScientists describe cancer cells as being \u2018 immortal \u2019 .\n\u2022 Cancer cells don \u2019 t obey signals from other cells \u2013 Something in the cancer cells overrides the normal signaling system .\nThis may be because the genes that tell the cell to reproduce keep on and on firing .\nOr because the genes that normally tell the cell to stop reproducing have been damaged or lost .\nSo the cancer cell keeps on doubling , regardless of the damage the extra cells cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cancer is growing .\n\u2022 Cancer cells don \u2019 t stick together \u2013 Cancer cells have lost the molecules on their surface that keep normal cells in the right place .\nSo they can become detached from their neighbors .\nThis phenomenon also helps explain how cancer cells spread to other parts of the body .\n\u2022 Cancer cells don \u2019 t specialize ; they stay immature \u2013 Unlike normal cells , rather than maturing , cancer cells become more and more primitive ( we call this undifferentiated ) and tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To prevent bumping into one another , normal healthy cells regulate their growth rate by communicating with neighboring cells via a mechanism called \u201c cell recognition \u201d in which each cell sends out multiple chemical messages in an ongoing biochemical \u201c conversation \u201d \u2014a heated discussion about who gets to grow ( or do other things cells do ) , and when .\nThere is an etiquette all cells subscribe to , and this very civilized molecular exchange definitively settles matters to everyone \u2019 s satisfaction .\nCancer cells , however , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree to do this .\nThey no longer feel the need to work out an agreement about territorial issues .\nThey want it all now , and refuse to stop growing .\nHaving regressed to barbarians , they just push everyone else aside .\nIt \u2019 s what would happen if a group of complete social idiots crashed a civilized dinner party , elbowed the guests aside , and started grabbing all the food for themselves .\nRespect for the rules that govern cooperative society is not on their radar .\nSay hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army \u2019 s most effective weapon\u2014by far\u2014is Nagalase , an enzyme made by all cancer cells ( and viruses ) that shuts down VDTP/GCMAF production , thus disabling the entire immune system .\nMacrophages need to be \u201c activated \u201d by VDTP/GCMAF ; without it , they just can \u2019 t fight .\nBy blocking VDTP/GCMAF production , Nagalase effectively cripples the immune army by putting its soldiers into a deep sleep .\n( Later on , I \u2019 ll be going into much greater detail about how this all works . )\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ It \u2019 s made up of your fearless immune cells , ready to square off against the cancer army and wage a protracted war .\nEach side \u2019 s fighters can number in the hundreds of billions , but the battle itself consists of hand-to-hand combat between individual macrophages and cancer cells in a battle to the death .\nThe macrophages attack and engulf ( phagocytize ) the cancer cells .\nThe cancer cells are trying to grow as fast as they can , while preventing the macrophages from killing and eating them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our human immune army .\nThey exist to protect and defend us from threats like cancer .\nStationed at critical strategic locations around your body ( and embedded in every tissue type ) , these cellular behemoths stand guard , ready to deploy sophisticated weaponry should an invader\u2014a virus , bacteria , fungus , toxin , or allergen\u2014or a cancer cell\u2014dare to \u2026er , \u2026 invade .\nAs cells go , macrophages are massive : roughly 30 times the size of an average body cell .\nIf a cancer cell were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ macrophage would be bigger than an 18-wheel semi .\nBut this would be no ordinary truck .\nMore like a Sherman tank , the macrocyte comes armed to the teeth with a multiplicity of nasty weapons .\nIt also knows how to tell friend from foe\u2014and if you \u2019 re foe , prepare to be more or less instantaneously liquidated .\nIn their quest to kill cancer cells and HIV virions , macrophages aren \u2019 t shy about deploying their array of high-tech devices .\nThey extrude clusters of long skinny powerful octopus-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their victim in , whereupon they surround , engulf , and digest it .\nThey emit free radical rays that fry the outer cell membranes of cancer cells and microbes they \u2019 ve tracked down .\nThen they casually spit out the dead parts and move on to the next cancer cell , bacteria , or virus .\nUtilizing sophisticated surveillance and communication systems , macros exchange complex messages with B and T lymphocyte cells .\nOutgoing messenger molecules tell lymphocytes where and how to aim their antibodies and inflammatory responses , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the enemy , providing specific directions about where and how to direct their intimidating weaponry .\nHow macros tell friend from foe Because it is very important that these killing machines not accidentally attack our own cells ( \u201c friendly fire \u201d ) , they are equipped with a system for distinguishing \u201c self \u201d from \u201c other.\n\u201d It \u2019 s an ID check , not unlike like police use when they inspect a driver \u2019 s license at a routine traffic stop .\nFirst the macrophage sends out a \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm that wraps around potential targets ( which are often identified by a cloak of sticky IgG antibodies ) , putting them into a strong \u201c headlock.\n\u201d The arm then contracts a little , pulling the intruder closer , in order to be able to \u201c frisk \u201d it .\n( Like a cop grabbing a fleeing suspect . )\n\u201c Self \u201d -cells have a molecular surface protein ( their \u201c drivers license \u201d ) that tells the macrophage , \u201c Friend here ; please let go of me.\n\u201d The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , allowing the self cell to move on .\nForeign cells , i.e.\n, those without the protein \u201c license , \u201d suffer the ignominious fate of being not just apprehended , but also summarily eaten alive .\nNo ticket , no trial , no judge , no jury ; this is raw cellular vigilante justice .\nImagine , if you can , literally billions of these macrophage war machines simultaneously tracking down , apprehending and dispatching malignant cells inside of a cancer patient .\nThe outcome of this microscopic war will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether or not the cancer army can successfully incapacitate our macrophage soldiers , because if this happens , the cancer will prevail .\nMacrophages are the ultimate fighting machine .\nBut they are not actually a machine : they are alive ; they \u201c think ; \u201d they make well-informed decisions .\nEach possesses a copy of your DNA , complete with all 25,000 ( or so ) genes , and this means they have the capacity to synthesize tens of thousands of chemicals\u2014whatever they need to fight the war .\nBut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , macrophages are natural slackers ; without a kick in the derriere , they \u2019 ll stay asleep .\nThat kick , the motivation to get up and get going , comes in the form of VDTP/GCMAF , a protein synthesized by our lymphocytes .\nVDTP/GCMAF attaches to receptors on the surface of the macrophages and sends a powerful message : \u201c Get to work \u2026 NOW !\n!\n!\n\u201d Two macrophages ( left , brown ) ensnaring bacteria ( blue ) in their long pseudopods .\n( Encyclopedia Britannica ) Nagalase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) puts macrophages to sleep The main weapon deployed by cancer cells and virus particles to sabotage our macrophage-driven immune response is an enzyme with a tongue-twisting name : alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase .\nWe call it Nagalase for short .\nNagalase defeats our immune system by blocking VDTP/GCMAF production .\nWithout VDTP/GCMAF , macros remain comatose .\nWithout macrophages to stop them , pathogenic invaders can grow at will .\nWith Nagalase on their side , cancer cells and viruses will multiply and they will spread .\nIn chapters 9 , 10 , and 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remarkable feat of outmaneuvering and zombifying our otherwise intimidating macrophage warriors .\nIn order to realize they are supposed to go out and destroy cancer cells , macrophages must be \u201c activated.\n\u201d VDTP/GCMAF ( stands for glycoprotein macrophage activating factor ) is our bodies \u2019 principal macrophage activating factor .\nVDTP/GCMAF is a protein that is made and released into the bloodstream by your T and B lymphocytes .\nMacrophage surface receptors monitor incoming chemical messages , patiently waiting for specific orders to activate .\nMuch as a tiny key fits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molecules locate and lock onto specific VDTP/GCMAF receptors on the outer surface of your macrophages .\nInserting the key ( VDTP/GCMAF ) into the lock ( VDTP/GCMAF receptor ) unleashes a powerful alarm that is instantaneously heard everywhere inside that cell ( even though the cell is millions of times larger that the VDTP/GCMAF molecule ! )\nThough there are some weaker chemical messengers that can give a little nudge toward activation , when VDTP/GCMAF comes along , macrophages really pay attention .\nWith volume turned all the way up , VDTP/GCMAF shouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !\n!\nTrack down and kill all cancer cells .\nKill all viruses !\n!\n!\nDO IT NOW !\n!\n!\n\u201d It \u2019 s kind of like a drill sergeant barking commands in boot camp .\nOr agent Jack Bauer mobilizing Counter Terrorist Unit field operations in \u201c 24.\n\u201d Based on size alone , this Lilliputian VDTP/GCMAF dictator has more power than the director of the FBI or CSI .\nAnd the \u201c signal \u201d is not a request ; it \u2019 s a command .\nThis is power and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the lights in a football stadium .\nWhen VDTP/GCMAF talks , macrophages listen .\nWhen a macrophage is under the control of VDTP/GCMAF , its activity level increases by a factor of 30 .\nIf it were an automobile , the macro would accelerate from 5 to 150 miles per hour .\nBut we \u2019 re not just talking velocity here ; we are , more importantly , talking about an explosion of activity .\nThe safety is off ; \u201c Big Mac \u201d is now armed , ready to do battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy .\nThe rate at which this now activated macrophage can seek , grab , and phagocytize alien life forms ( and other nonliving foreign intruders , like toxins and allergens ) is awe-inspiring .\nOnce activated by VDTP/GCMAF , macrophages morph into relentless killers .\nBut when de-activated by Nagalase , they slow to a crawl and refuse to deploy their awesome array of weaponry They start losing the war on cancers and microbes .\nIf macrophages remain deactivated , the patient will eventually die .\nInjecting VDTP/GCMAF bypasses the production blockage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following charts from Dr. Yamamoto \u2019 s early metastatic cancer and HIV studies illustrates how VDTP/GCMAF injections bypass the Nagalase production blockage and cure cancer .\nPatients received weekly injections of 100 nanograms of VDTP/GCMAF .\nThe VDTP/GCMAF -activated macrophages destroyed the pathogens ( cancer cells and virus particles ) , thus lowering the amount of Nagalase they make .\nWeekly Nagalase reaches healthy control levels in all cases , indicating the patients are cured .\nMacrophages are big and smart white blood cells that chase , capture , engulf , and digest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literally , \u201c eat \u201d ) their enemies .\nThey can multiply rapidly when necessary .\nHowever , they \u2019 re naturally indolent and need to be activated by VDTP/GCMAF .\nOpsonin \u201c super glue \u201d helps them stick to their prey .\nTheir electron-driven free radical death ray ( AKA \u201c oxidative burst \u201d ) blasts holes in microbes and cancer cells .\nOnce a microbe or cancer cell has been phagocytized by a macro , it is encapsulated inside a \u201c phagolysosome \u201d ( the intracellular \u201c death chamber \u201d ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it isn \u2019 t dead already ) , and then dissected down into its component parts , which are then recycled .\nAlthough I have already described macrophages , these large immune cells are so important in terms of understanding how VDTP/GCMAF works that I need to go into a little more detail about them .\nBesides , they are truly fascinating critters !\nIf you could imagine a living , breathing , oozing , cunningly horrific humongous sticky blob that combines the dangerously diabolical features of King Kong \u2019 s intimidating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Darth Vader \u2019 s lightsaber , The Terminator , Bruce Lee , and the Marshmallow Man that takes over New York City in Ghostbusters\u2014all rolled into one giant killing machine\u2014you \u2019 d have some idea of what a macrophage is all about .\nThey \u2019 re big .\nThey \u2019 re nasty .\nIf you were a bacteria , virus , or cancer cell , you would do your darnedest to avoid them .\nAs cells go , macrophages are huge How big is a \u201c Big Mac \u201d ?\nBy way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white blood cells , and typical cancer cells are about 7 microns ( micrometers or millionths of a meter ) in diameter and have a volume of about 250 cubic microns .\nAt about 20 micrometers ( 20 millionths of a meter ) in diameter , macrophages are about three times as wide as regular cells .\nBut , because a little extra width translates into a lot of extra volume , macrophages\u2014at around 4000 cubic microns\u2014have about 16 times the volume of normal sized cells .\nIf a cancer cell were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ macrophage would be bigger than an 18 wheeler .\nBut this behemoth is not a dumb truck .\nBristling with weaponry , it \u2019 s stuffed to the gills with a daunting array of high-tech systems programmed for a singular purpose : take out the enemy as quickly and efficiently as possible .\nWe call this \u201c tumoricidal capacity.\n\u201d Here \u2019 s how it works .\nWhen it isn \u2019 t swimming in the blood stream , a macrophage can slowly \u201c walk \u201d through tissues using self-generated stumpy little ( one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten of them sprout at a time ) .\nThe macrophage ambles over to and snuggles up alongside a \u201c foreign invader \u201d ( e.g.\n, cancer cell or virion ) , quickly identifies it as foe , sprays it with membrane-frying free radical-laden Darth Vader death beams , grabs , engulfs , smothers , kills , and digests it .\nIf the enemy is further away , or trying to escape , the macro chases after it , extrudes a cluster of long thin sticky spaghetti-like tentacles that wrap around and ensnare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unbreakable strangle hold .\nIn a process known as phagocytosis , the macro draws in its victim , engulfs and smothers it , then encases it in a small bubble-like cyst ( called a phagolysosome ) inside its cytoplasm .\nThe phagolysosome then secretes a cocktail of corrosive free radicals and enzymes that rapidly digest its victim down into its component parts ( amino acids , nucleic acids , fatty acids , etc. )\n.\nThe macrophage then spits out these pieces into the intercellular \u201c soup .\n\u201d Because the remnants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cellular building blocks , the body quickly recycles them using the \u201c spare parts \u201d to build brand new healthy cells .\nI finding it totally amazing that this complex and truly violent scenario is unfolding in you and me billions of times per minute .\nA review of the macrophage \u2019 s most important weapons : Literally \u201c false legs.\n\u201d These can be short and stumpy , e.g.\n, like the ones macros make in order to \u201c walk \u201d along the inner lining of blood vessels .\nFor chasing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make much longer pseudopods that extend out relatively large distances ( perhaps 60 microns ) .\nImagine a macro the size of a Volkswagen with the capability to extend hundreds of long thin arms ( each about the diameter of an exhaust pipe ) out to 50 feet or more .\nOnce out there , they can weave themselves into a net that tangles around and traps the hapless enemy .\nIf that target were a cancer cell , it would be about the size of a motor scooter .\nIf a bacterium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a roller skate .\nOnce the pseudopods have ensnared their victim , the engulfing process ensues .\nThe outer membranes of the pseudopods nearest the microbe or cancer cell simply merge into one another so that the victim is completely surrounded and encapsulated in what is called a phagolysosome .\n( \u201c Phago \u201d means \u201c eat , \u201d \u201c lyso \u201d means \u201c digest , \u201d and \u201c some \u201d means \u201c cell \u201d or \u201c body.\n\u201d ) Amoeba-like , the macrophage has reshaped itself such that the phagolysosome lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes up the wall surrounding the phagolysosome shoots more death rays at its captured prey ( just to make sure it is dead ) , and proceeds to digest it with an array of corrosive enzymes .\nMore about phagolysosomes in a minute .\nTo see a cool video of a white blood cell ( a neutrophil ) chasing and phagocytizing a bacteria , go here : Opsonins : Super Glue \u201c binding enhancers \u201d that help macros latch onto enemies To help them grab and hold their victims , macrophages send signals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spray a thin coating of sticky proteins onto potential prey .\nThen , when the macro \u2019 s long thin arms make contact with the microbe or cancer cell , this \u201c super glue \u201d coating hardens , making it impossible for the desperado to shake loose .\nTypically , a macro sends out a cluster of ( say twenty or so ) sticky pseudopods that surround the enemy cell , encasing it in a mesh like affair , not unlike a large fish net , in which the microbe or cancer cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flypaper , the enemy cell is both stuck in it and to it , so there is no way to get loose .\nThen the prey is gradually surrounded and engulfed , ending up snugly inside the macro as a phagolysosome , in which it spends its last few moments as a life form before being digested down into its component parts by various free radicals and enzymes .\nThe sticky proteins are called \u201c binding enhancers \u201d or \u201c opsonins.\n\u201d The gluing process is called \u201c opsonization.\n\u201d Interestingly , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it wants its fellow phagocytic soldiers to know prey is nearby , so\u2014like an isolated soldier who has stumbled upon a group of enemy troops and is calling for backup\u2014 it sends out protein signals telling nearby macrophages to make more of the receptors that specialize in grabbing specifically that kind of enemy .\nThere \u2019 s safety in numbers .\n( Technically this is called \u201c upregulating expression of complement receptors on neighboring phagocytes.\n\u201d ) Because it is so diabolically sophisticated\u2014and right out of Star Wars\u2014my favorite macrophage weapon is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widely known as the \u201c respiratory burst \u201d ) .\nThis is the Darth Vader death ray .\nAn enzyme ( called NADPH oxidase ) stationed in the macro \u2019 s outer membrane sprays out a beam of highly reactive free electrons , like bullets from a machine gun .\nRemember those old TV sets with picture tubes ?\nThe NADPH gun is kind of like that .\nAt the back of the tube an electron gun aimed particles that hit phosphorescent particles on the screen .\nWhen the electron beam hit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating a picture .\nLikewise , NADPH also emits a particle beam .\nBut instead of playing Howdy Doody , it \u2019 s blasting tumor cells and microbes to smithereens .\nThe electrons in the beam emerge one at a time , but they really really don \u2019 t want to be \u201c free , \u201d so\u2014as fast as they possibly can\u2014they snatch another electron to form a stable pair ( we are talking nanoseconds here ) .\nA chain reaction of electron-snatchings triggered by the oxidative burst literally vaporizes molecules in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viral capsid , ripping holes in it .\nNow the membrane that held the victim together literally falls apart , spilling out its contents .\nWithout an intact outer membrane , a cancer cell can \u2019 t survive for very long .\nOxidative bursts don \u2019 t happen all of the time .\nThat would be a waste of firepower .\nThe \u201c trigger \u201d that turns it on is the perceived proximity of a \u201c foe , \u201d a cancer cell , HIV virus , hepatitis virus , or a bacterium .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ with \u201c enemy , \u201d then\u2014and only then\u2014does it turn on the electron death beam .\nThere are lots of oxygen ( O2 ) molecules everywhere in our bodies .\n( We need plenty of oxygen and glucose , the \u201c fuels \u201d from which we generate the \u201c energy \u201d that drives all of the cellular chemical reactions that make life possible . )\nWhen released , most of the electrons in the death ray beam crash into one of these omnipresent oxygen molecules , from which they quickly grab the electron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe oxygen molecule now is missing one of its electrons , and is thus transformed into the violently corrosive free radical known as \u201c superoxide \u201d ( O2- ) .\nNow superoxide is the one wanting an electron , and it will destroy anything in its path to get one .\nThat \u201c anything \u201d would be the virus , bacterium , or cancer cell our macro has grabbed with its pseudopod .\nSuddenly the invader finds itself with a huge hole in its outer membrane .\nIt \u2019 ll die soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trigger chain reactions forming other reactive free radical species .\nOne of these is the hydroxyl ion ( OH- ) .\nThis is hydrogen peroxide , just like the stuff that comes out of that brown bottle , but 33 times as potent\u2014a locally generated intercellular dose .\nPerfect for frying microbes and tumor cells .\nBy oxidizing omnipresent chlorine atoms , the electron beam also generates noxious hypochlorous acid ( HClO ) , which can poke a hole in an enemy membrane in nothing flat .\nNow we have a toxic soup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do tremendous local damage to our enemies .\n\u201c Wait a minute , \u201d ( I can hear you saying , ) \u201c how come our own cells aren \u2019 t damaged by friendly fire ?\nHow do they escape the death rays ?\n\u201d Great question .\nWe have a protective shield that prevents the free electrons and free radicals from damaging our own cells .\nIt \u2019 s called SOD ( superoxide dismutase ) and it \u2019 s an enzyme ( a large protein molecule ) that specializes in neutralizing superoxide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage our own cells .\nFor maximum protection , SOD is positioned right next to the NADPH death ray generator proteins in the outer cell wall ( or membrane ) of our macrophages .\nThe \u201c barrel \u201d ( the NADPH molecule ) of the macro \u2019 s electron-generating death ray gun is aimed toward the outside of the cell and sticks out of a little hole that is surrounded and protected by molecules of SOD , forming a kind of \u201c bunker \u201d to protect the electron gun and your macrophage cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SOD ( and we \u2019 d be dead in minutes if we stopped ) , we \u2019 ll be safe ; the electron beam can \u2019 t harm us .\nIt \u2019 s a pretty cool combination : a ridiculously deadly weapon with built-in safeguards for the user ( that would be you ) .\nYou \u2019 ve heard this before , but I have to say it again : only VDTP/GCMAF \u2013 activated macros are going to deliver oxidative bursts that are potent enough to be effective .\nIf Nagalase from viruses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sleep , the oxidative burst degenerates into a piddly potato gun that \u2019 s not going to hurt anybody .\nFirepower\u2014or lack thereof\u2014is what we are talking about here .\nRemember those old westerns in which six-shooters were the main weapon ?\nThere \u2019 d be a shot here , long pauses , and then another shot over there ?\nThere was a long enough gap between shots that you could actually hear the ricochets .\nThat \u2019 s a de-activated mac : slow at the draw and not getting very many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shots .\nNo wonder the Indians creamed Custer .\nActivated macros fire the atomic equivalent of millions of rounds a second and never have to pause to reload .\nSome newer movies have so many bullets flying from so many directions that it is hard to understand how anyone could survive .\nThat \u2019 s firepower of the sort only VDTP/GCMAF \u2013activated macrophages could deliver .\nIf , somehow , a microbe or cancer cell has survived the oxidative burst and phagocytosis , it will not survive the death chamber .\nOnce eaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ macrophage \u2019 s cytoplasm , the enemy is imprisoned in a round cyst-like bubble inside the macrophage ( called a phagolysosome ) into which are squirted all sorts of digestive enzymes and many more rounds of oxidative burst , just for good measure .\nPretty things do not happen inside of phagolysosomes .\nIf the cancer cell or microbe is not already dead , the phagolysosome \u201c death chamber \u201d will certainly polish it off .\n( \u201c Phago \u201d means \u201c to eat.\n\u201d \u201c Lyso \u201d means \u201c to dissolve.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or \u201c bag.\n\u201d ) Once the dismembering process is complete , the phagolysosome slides over and makes contact with the outer cell membrane , merges with it , then disgorges the now harmless breakdown products ( nucleic acids , fatty acids , amino acids , etc . )\nout into the extracellular fluid .\nThey are then taken up by nearby cells and recycled into new body parts .\nThe ecologically-minded among us should find the efficiency of this process commendable .\nNothing is wasted .\nScary toxic bad guys are killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts for the good guys : us .\nTalk about communication systems !\nImmune cells\u2014macrophages and lymphocytes\u2014 carry on a constant blather , like a huge town hall chat room where everybody is talking at once .\nHowever , since the talking is a release of \u201c messenger molecules \u201d and the listening is done by protein receptors , immune cells can actually listen while they are talking !\n!\nNo need to complain about being interrupted !\nIt \u2019 s weird , and foreign to us humans , but this simultaneous talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange of messages than if you had to stop and listen every time the other guy was talking ( like we humans usually do ) .\nThere is so much activity , what with the constant molecular chatter coupled with a madhouse of cellular scrambling to grab and kill enemy cells as rapidly as possible , that the casual observer might get the impression of chaos .\nBut she would be sadly mistaken .\nThere are no wasted efforts here .\nLike a Beethoven symphony , everything is extremely well-organized and perfectly coordinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other immune cells is so rapid and efficient that it would make a sophisticated military communications system look like a bunch of kids with tin can phones .\nMacros release clouds of messenger molecules ( cytokines , interferons , leukotrienes , and other small molecules ) \u2014at rates of up to thousands of molecules per second per cell .\nEach molecule carries a specific request or command .\nLike \u201c Bring me this , \u201d or \u201c We need some of that over there , \u201d or \u201c Kill everything that looks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response over here.\n\u201d Or \u201c We don \u2019 t need to do that anymore.\n\u201d They discuss what the enemy looks like and how aggressive he is .\nThey tell each other how hard to work .\nThey label targets for other cells to identify and kill .\nThey talk about where the enemy is hiding .\nThey discuss current enemy strategy and how best to outmaneuver it .\nLast , but definitely not least , macros\u2014if outgunned\u2014play the population card : they multiply rapidly .\nWhen they find themselves in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particle density , they don \u2019 t have to call up the draft to get more troops ; they simply clone themselves , which they can do on very short notice .\nMore macros automatically translates into more of all the other weapons enumerated above .\nBut , again , this multiplication process occurs only in activated macros .\nWithout VDTP/GCMAF , macros languish .\nIn the presence of VDTP/GCMAF , their activity level increases exponentially .\nOnce activated , macros multiply rapidly and attack ferociously .\nIn the following chapter , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multitude of nasty weapons , macrophages languish without VDTP/GCMAF \u201c activation.\n\u201d Quantifying immune activation .\nMacros use \u201c antigen presenting \u201d messengers to reverse immunosuppression and activate other immune cells .\nElevated Nagalase blocks VDTP/GCMAF -driven macrophage activation , resulting in immunosuppression .\nI think you \u2019 d have to admit that macrophages are pretty amazing\u2014and intimidating\u2014characters .\nExpanded to human scale , they would be far superior to any existing weapon .\nThey \u2019 d be able to blow their way through cement walls , devour moose-sized animals whole and grab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cluster of their long strong ad hoc arms .\nBut\u2014as with most things that seem too good to be true\u2014there \u2019 s a hitch .\nDespite their incredible potential to protect and defend us , macrophages are naturally indolent .\nThese slackers sleep until noon ( figuratively speaking ) , and hang out in the blood stream like a beach bum at the seashore .\nIt might be more generous to say that in their natural state they are \u201c off duty.\n\u201d Macros accomplish absolutely nothing beyond eating enough to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c replication experience.\n\u201d An inactive ( or deactivated ) macrophage lacks the killer instinct and might float right past a huge gathering of cancer cells or some partying virus particles , oblivious to their presence .\nNot exactly a killing machine ; more like a gargantuan lifeless blob of cold gooey marshmallow .\nTo get motivated , these loafers need a swift kick in the butt .\nBecause we are serious scientists , however , we have to call this \u201c macrophage activation.\n\u201d It is accomplished by specific \u201c activator proteins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ macrophage \u2019 s surface , not unlike the toe of a boot ( the activator protein ) being embedded in the butt ( the receptor ) of a slacker ( the macrophage ) .\nThough several types of molecules are known to give macros a gentle shove , VDTP/GCMAF is by far the most potent macrophage activating factor .\nIn fact , nothing comes close .\nAs VDTP/GCMAF docks on its receptors on the outer surface of the macrophage , it sends a signal to the entire cell , telling it to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed , and prepare for battle .\nOur laid- back beachcombers morph into frenzied kamikaze warriors .\nWe are not talking about a nudge here ; the word \u201c activation \u201d may be too weak to describe a phenomenon that consists of a 30-fold increase in macrophage activity .\nImagine a Model T putting along at 20 mph suddenly transforming into a jet plane doing 600 !\n!\n!\nYou get the idea .\nVDTP/GCMAF activation transforms macrophages\u2014more or less instantaneously ( okay , it takes about 3.5 hours ) \u2014into a super @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a phenomenal rate .\nVDTP/GCMAF restores the \u201c tumoricidal capacity \u201d of macrophages\u2014it \u2019 s ability to rapidly scarf and kill viruses and cancer cells\u2014that had been obstructed by the Nagalase .\nBattalions of activated macros now track down and chew their way through enemy armies , spewing out dead parts along the roadside behind them so fast they make it look easy .\nDr. Yamamoto quantified several specific measures of macrophage activation .\nComparing deactivated to VDTP/GCMAF -reactivated macros , he observed a 30-fold increase in rate of tumor cell ingestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the \u201c oxidative burst \u201d ( a sudden release of superoxide ( O2- ) ions that zaps cancer cells , bacteria , and viruses ) , a 40-fold increase in systemic macrophage counts , and an exponential 180-fold rise in macrophage levels in inflamed lesions .\n( The latter because activated macros , via a process known as chemotaxis\u2014are attracted toward , and migrate , to areas of inflammation\u2014e.g.\n, cancers and viral infections . )\nWeekly injections of VDTP/GCMAF unleashes armies with billions of these VDTP/GCMAF -activated cloned macrophages that relentlessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about six months .\n( Dr. Yamamoto \u2019 s metastatic breast , colon and prostate cancer cases were all put into a five year remission\u2014if not cured\u2014within this time frame . )\nLarger tumors\u2014a bigger meal for the macros , so to speak\u2014 present more of a challenge .\nHere , results will certainly vary from one patient to the next , and some will not be curable .\nWe really don \u2019 t yet have hard data on larger masses .\nThe macros will certainly do their best\u2014if activated\u2014but for each patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of no return where the tumor has gotten so big ( or the viral load so large ) that it can successfully fend off and stay ahead of the best efforts of the activated macros .\nLike that proud mouser cat who insists on dropping dead rodents at his master \u2019 s feet to prove he is earning his keep , macrophages , in a strange , microscopic sense , are similarly proud of the fact that they have identified , trapped , phagocytized , killed , and dismembered a desperado , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viral particle .\nSo , to spread the word of their success to their immune cell comrades , macros release triumphant clouds of messenger molecules .\nMacrophages also want to pass on identity information to other immune cells so that everybody else can more easily identify the bad guys .\nTo accomplish this , macros biochemically paint the molecular biological equivalent of a huge luminescent \u201c X \u201d on scraggly pieces of leftover detritus that ( prior to dismemberment in its phagolysosome ) had been part of a cancer cell or a virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these brightly-labeled parts float off like a message in a bottle that , when discovered by another immune cell , tells it to \u201c Keep an eye out for anything resembling this guy\u2014and when you see it , kill it.\n\u201d Other immune cells find the bottles , read the messages , and instantaneously know\u2014and remember\u2014that this is the kind of cell they should be targeting .\nWord spreads fast among phagocytes .\nSince living cancer cells contain these same parts as those marked with the \u201c X , \u201d lymphocytes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now can instantaneously recognize the enemy and take them out without further ado .\nWe call this \u201c antigen presenting , \u201d and it serves a dual purpose : first it spreads the word about whom to target , and second , it transfers the activation of macros to all other immune cells .\nIf macros aren \u2019 t activated , antigen-presenting ( and all other immune functions ) slows to a crawl .\nCancers and viral infections deactivate macrophages by manufacturing and releasing Nagalase ( alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase ) , the enzyme that prevents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Nagalase ) , the entire immune system has dropped out .\nThey \u2019 ve reverted to a collection of stagnant , indolent , ineffectual cells\u2014all \u201c gone fishin \u2019 .\n\u201d The end result is stagnation\u2014general immunosuppression\u2014and an environment in which cancers and viruses get a huge green light .\nDeactivated macrophages malfunction in numerous ways .\nPhagocytic activity dramatically declines .\nNow no invaders are being eaten , so no luminously labeled tumor or bug parts are being spit out , so \u2018 antigen presenting \u2019 screeches to a halt .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the immune system won \u2019 t be warned that invaders are nearby , so it remains dormant .\nAs you can see , the deactivation itself perpetuates more deactivation ; it \u2019 s a vicious cycle .\nSo all the other immune cells sit idly by waiting for marching orders that never come .\nThe entire cascade that leads to ramped up immune activity is blocked when macros are not being activated by VDTP/GCMAF .\nFrom the macrophage \u2019 s perspective , this is a nightmare scenario .\nLike Gulliver , it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lilliputian Nagalase molecules .\nBig Mac wants to get up and go out and kick some butt , but it can \u2019 t .\nImmune activity grinds to a halt .\nDr. Yamamoto puts it this way : \u201c Macrophages are the major phagocytic and antigen-presenting cells .\nBecause macrophage activation for phagocytosis and antigen presentation to B and T lymphocytes is the first ( and ) indispensable step in the development of both humoral and cellular immunity , lack of macrophage activation leads to immunosuppression.\n\u201d ( Immunotherapy of Prostate Cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Translational Oncology Vol .\n1 , No .\n2 , 2008 . )\nAn illustrated description of the biochemical transformations involved in the synthesis of VDTP/GCMAF from Vitamin D Binding protein .\nHow your body makes the VDTP/GCMAF that activates macrophages and protects you from cancer and viruses VDTP/GCMAF and Nagalase are both proteins , so let me start with a brief\u2014and hopefully painless\u2014primer on proteins .\nYou know those birthday present bows made of clusters of curly ribbons ?\nUnder a very powerful microscope , proteins look like that .\nThe ribbons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acids that make up a protein molecule .\nOur DNA is programmed to make tens of thousands of different proteins , and what makes them different is the ordering of the amino acids .\nEach strand ( usually there are three or four of them ) of curled ribbon in our birthday bow is one of those chains .\nThe curly ribbons are all attached together where the bow is fastened to the present .\nThey may look like a big blob of randomly-placed bands\u2014and in the ribbon , they are .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very specific three-dimensional structure , such that even though the curly ribbons look randomly placed , they are , in fact , very precisely positioned\u2014and even slight positional changes will significantly alter the nature of the protein .\nVitamin D-binding protein ( DBP ) is the precursor protein out of which our immune cells make VDTP/GCMAF .\nUp close DBP looks kind of like a small Brillo pad , but the convolutions are not sharp-edged ; they \u2019 re actually quite soft and sticky .\nDBP contains 458 amino acids , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from all the others .\nThis is a threonine amino acid , the 420th amino acid in its chain .\nAttached to this threonine is a group of three sugars .\nThe presence of these sugars defines the purpose of the entire DBP protein molecule .\nTo keep things simple , I am going to name the three sugar molecules after candy bars .\nBecause Vitamin D Binding Protein comes with sugars attached , we can now refer to it as a glycoprotein .\nMost of the immune system \u2019 s \u201c messenger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DBP as this large protein with three sugars ( or candy bars ) attached .\nThe first is a Hershey \u2019 s bar , the second is a Milky Way , and the third is a Snickers .\nAll three are attached to one another , as shown in the diagram , in an upside-down \u201c Y \u201d -shaped configuration .\nVitamin D-Binding Protein ( DBP ) is the starting point in VDTP/GCMAF production .\nDBP is the protein from which we are going to make VDTP/GCMAF .\nThe dashes ( \u2013 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hold atoms together to form chemicals ) that attach the sugars to each other and to the protein .\nNow let \u2019 s transform our candy bar model of DBP into VDTP/GCMAF .\nThere are two steps in this process .\nThe first step is to snip off the Milky Way bar .\n( This is performed by the enzyme beta-galactosidase which is embedded in the outer cell membrane of B-lymphocytes . )\nYou can go ahead and eat it ; we won \u2019 t need it anymore .\nIf you don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will just recycle it .\nThe second step is to snip off the Snickers bar .\n( This is performed by the enzyme sialidase , which is located in the outer membrane of T-lymphocyte cells . )\n( You can have that one too , if you want to get on the fast track to diabetes . )\nNow we \u2019 re left with a huge protein that has just the remaining Hershey \u2019 s hanging off of it .\nGuess what : this is VDTP/GCMAF .\nBy snipping off two of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then the Snickers bar ) , we have transformed the Vitamin D-Binding Protein into VDTP/GCMAF .\nIt \u2019 s fully formed and ready to float off , find a macrophage , lock onto its receptor , and then send a powerful message to the entire cell , telling it to stop watching reruns of Desperate Housewives and get to work beating up microbes and killing cancer cells .\nAnd , as you know , when VDTP/GCMAF talks , macros listen .\nJust for the record ( and for you biochemists in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is alpha-N-acetylgalactosamine ( GalNAc ) , the Milky Way is D-galactose , and the Snickers bar is sialic acid ( also known as N-acetylneuraminic acid ) .\nNow that we have synthesized some VDTP/GCMAF , we \u2019 ll see\u2014in Chapter 9 how Nagalase sabotages it\u2026 Nagalase is a protein made by all cancer cells and viruses ( HIV , hepatitis B , hepatitis C , influenza , herpes , Epstein-Barr virus , and others ) .\nIts formal , official chemical name is alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase , but this is such a tongue-twisting mouthful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u201c Nagalase.\n\u201d ( Sometimes , when I want to impress friends with my brilliance , I \u2019 ll say the entire word real fast : \u201c alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase.\n\u201d I have found that it \u2019 s important to practice beforehand if one doesn \u2019 t want to embarrass oneself . )\n\u2022 Nagalase causes immunodeficiency .\nNagalase blocks production of VDTP/GCMAF , thus preventing the immune system from doing its job .\nWithout an active immune system , cancer and viral infections can grow unchecked .\n\u2022 As an extremely sensitive marker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful system for early detection .\n\u2022 Serial Nagalase testing provides a reliable and accurate method for tracking the results of any therapeutic regimen for cancer , AIDS , or other chronic viral infection .\nNagalase proves that cancer cells break all the rules Normal healthy cells cooperate with one another in a concerted effort to further the good of all .\nCancer cells refuse to play ball .\nTheir disdainful attitude toward the rest of our cellular community is appalling .\nFor example , these cellular scofflaws ignore clear messages to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbor \u2019 s space .\nHow would you like it if your neighbor moved his fence over into your backyard ?\nOf all the rules cancer cells break , none is more alarming than the production of Nagalase , the evil enzyme that completely hog-ties the immune system army \u2019 s ability to stop cancer cells .\nVirus particles also make Nagalase .\nTheir goal is the same as that of the cancer cells : survival by incapacitating their number one enemy : the immune system .\nLike a stealth bomber , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cancer cell or a virus particle pinpoints the VDTP/GCMAF production facilities on the surface of your T and B lymphocytes and then wipes them out with an incredibly precise bomb .\nHow precise ?\nLet me put it this way : Nagalase locates and attacks one specific two-electron bond located at , and only at , the 420th amino acid position on a huge protein molecule ( DBP ) , one of tens of thousands of proteins , each containing millions of electrons .\nThis is like selectively taking out a park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand miles away .\nMore astonishing , if that is possible , Nagalase never misses its target .\nThere is no collateral damage .\nAs you already know , VDTP/GCMAF is a cell-signaling glycoprotein that talks to macrophages , enabling them to rapidly find , attack , and kill viruses and cancer cells .\nBy activating macrophages , VDTP/GCMAF triggers a cascade that activates the entire immune system .\nBlockage of VDTP/GCMAF production by Nagalase brings all this wonderful anti-cancer and anti-viral immune activity to a screeching halt , allowing cancer and infections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ?\nHow does it destroy immune functioning and deactivate macrophages ?\nOnce synthesized and released into nearby tissue or into the bloodstream , Nagalase , like that drill sergeant at boot camp , shouts harsh commands at the vitamin D binding protein ( DBP ) that is about to be turned into VDTP/GCMAF .\nNagalase demands that DBP not , under any circumstances , attach itself to a specific sugar molecule ( galactosamine ) .\nIf DBP has already grabbed ( i.e.\n, connected to , using a two-electron , \u201c covalent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is commanded to immediately let go .\n\u201c Leave galactosamine alone , or you \u2019 ll be in big trouble !\n!\n!\n\u201d is the Nagalase sergeant \u2019 s command .\nWe \u2019 ll probably never know whether or not , on some deeper level , DBP knows that Nagalase \u2019 s motives are dastardly\u2014but it doesn \u2019 t really matter : DBP will definitely always obey .\nLike the army private , the DBP literally has no choice .\nBecause of the way hierarchies work in cellular biology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enzymes .\nThe enzymes , like Nagalase , are the drill sergeant and the proteins , like DBP , are the privates .\nThat \u2019 s just the way it is .\nObeying the drill sergeant \u2019 s command means DBP can \u2019 t do its assigned task , that of becoming VDTP/GCMaf .\nIt is rendered useless .\nFor DBP , on a molecular level , life no longer has meaning .\nUnfortunately for cancer and viral patients , DBP had been on its way to becoming VDTP/GCMaf until the Nagalase drill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2014the one protein our bodies need in order to activate our immune systems\u2014can \u2019 t be made .\nImmune activity screeches to a halt .\nThe defense system protecting us from cancers and viruses has been snuffed out .\nNagalase , using this astonishingly simple yet cunningly subversive technique , emasculates the VDTP/GCMaf precursor protein ( DBP ) by knocking off its three sugar molecules .\nOne quick whack by Nagalase and the DBP protein that would have become a VDTP/GCMaf molecule now limps off into the sunset , permanently disfigured and disabled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nagalase has brought the entire immune system to its knees .\nHere \u2019 s how Dr. Yamamoto put it ( for clarity , I \u2019 ve replaced some of the technical words ) : \u201c Serum vitamin D3-binding protein ( DBP ) is the precursor for the principal macrophage activating factor ( VDTP/GCMaf ) .\nThe precursor activity of serum DBP was reduced\u2026 These patient sera contained alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase ( Nagalase ) that deglycosylates ( removes the sugars from ) DBP .\nDeglycosylated DBP can not be converted to VDTP/GCMaf ,

glimpse of a new cancer or viral infection .\nThe old adage , \u201c Where there \u2019 s smoke , there \u2019 s fire \u201d applies here .\nA positive Nagalase test notifies us that a cancer ( or a nasty virus ) lurks within .\nNagalase appears in the blood stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute cluster of abnormal cells , long before conventional diagnostic methods can detect it .\nThrough blood testing , we can find this red flag , even when present at exceedingly low levels .\nProviding us with this early warning sign might not quite qualify Nagalase for the \u201c Good Samaritan \u201d award , but I could go with \u201c extremely useful.\n\u201d Like a rehabilitated criminal on parole , the potential for harm is still there .\nFor now , however , he \u2019 s staying out of trouble and doing community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s a mass murderer again .\nRising Nagalase levels indicate a cancer or virus is growing and spreading .\nConversely , Nagalase levels will decrease if the cancer or infection is being effectively destroyed .\nAny treatment that lowers cancer cell ( or viral numbers ) will lower Nagalase levels .\nNagalase will , for example , always drop after surgery ( whether or not the entire tumor was removed ) .\nChemotherapy and radiation also reduce Nagalase levels .\nSo does VDTP/GCMaf .\nIf , after these treatments , the depressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the warning sign that the cancer was not completely removed , and/or that metastatic disease is hiding out somewhere .\nWith viral infections , increasing Nagalase levels indicate return of the infection .\nConsecutive rising Nagalase levels are therefore a red flag , warning us it may be time to entertain new treatment options .\nConversely , if levels are going down , stay the course : the cancer or virus is going away .\nMany medical professionals don \u2019 t feel comfortable with \u201c nonspecific \u201d tests like Nagalase .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer is lurking somewhere inside without knowing exactly where it is located .\n\u201c How , \u201d they ask , \u201c do you expect me to treat a cancer I can \u2019 t see ?\nWhy , I \u2019 m not going to tilt at windmills !\n\u201d This may be a signal that you need to find a different doctor , perhaps one who works in an alternative cancer clinic .\nHere you will find highly-trained professionals who understand the concept that cancer is a molecular biological change long before it presents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewable on imaging ) .\nWhen VDTP/GCMaf becomes available , the answer will be easier : a six month course of weekly 100 ng VDTP/GCMaf intramuscular injections with monthly Nagalase level tests to follow the Nagalase level as it goes back down to baseline .\nThe cancer can be declared cured , even though it never reached life-threatening proportions .\n( We have a long way to go before this kind of medical behavior will be commonplace and acceptable .\nThe sooner the better , however . )\nNagalase , arguably our most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat in terms of cancer perpetuation and viruses \u2019 ability to continually defeat us .\nYet cancer researchers have not shown any interest in it .\n( Maybe I \u2019 m being a little too generous here ; perhaps \u201c clueless \u201d would be more a more accurate depiction . )\nWhy don \u2019 t they get it that blasting cancer cells into oblivion with chemo and radiation is usually not sufficient to stop advanced disease and does nothing to address the cause : immunosuppression .\nEven if we ignore for the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugs and radiation , the patient also needs\u2014requires\u2014a healthy immune system to finish the job .\nIf we don \u2019 t revive immune function by disabling Nagalase , the cancers and viruses will just keep roaring back .\nRestoring immunocompetence by negating the stultifying effect of Nagalase should therefore become a primary research goal .\nCancer cells and all viruses manufacture and release Nagalase , the enzyme that sabotages VDTP/GCMaf .\nWithout VDTP/GCMaf , macrophages remain in a deep slumber .\nThis chapter answers the question : \u201c How does Nagalase do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( because I have reiterated it ad nauseum ) , the Nagalase spewed out by cancer cells and virus particles neutralizes the immune-activating effects of VDTP/GCMaf .\nFor millions of years VDTP/GCMaf ( and our immune systems ) have had no defense against Nagalase .\nThen Professor Nobuto Yamamoto came along and figured out how Nagalase paralyzes immune functioning .\nHe then went on to demonstrate that replacing the VDTP/GCMaf deficiency dramatically restores immune function , effectively circumventing the roadblock set up by Nagalase .\nThe ultra-miniature Nagalase power play that I \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond its trifling size .\nThis relatively simple molecular biological enzymatic reaction has cost billions of humans their lives .\nWho would \u2019 ve thought that chipping a few sugars off of a glycoprotein molecule could have wreaked such carnage ?\nA saboteur is one who intentionally causes the destruction of property in order to hinder the efforts of his/her enemy .\nThe word derives from 15th century Netherlands , where , fearing that automated machines would render their occupations obsolete , Dutch workers threw their sabots ( wooden shoes ) into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to break the cogs .\nLikewise , Nagalase , the saboteur , \u201c throws a boot \u201d into the biochemical machinery that produces VDTP/GCMaf .\nNow I will describe\u2014on a molecular \u201c blow by blow \u201d basis\u2014how Nagalase blocks VDTP/GCMaf production .\nRecall from Chapter 8 : How Your Body Makes VDTP/GCMaf that our lymphocytes make VDTP/GCMaf by enzymatically removing two of three sugars from a Vitamin D Binding Protein ( DBP ) molecule : To appreciate how Nagalase interferes with VDTP/GCMaf production , imagine that DBP is the baby that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBaby VDTP/GCMaf ( AKA DBP ) is trying to hold onto its Hershey \u2019 s bar ( AKA N-acetylgalactosamine ) .\nNagalase comes along and snatches all three sugars away from the \u201c baby.\n\u201d ( See illustration below . )\nThe sugars float away , off into the cellular soup , never to be heard from again .\n( Oh , I imagine sooner or later\u2014as with other sugars\u2014they \u2019 ll be burned up in a mitochondrial factory to generate a little cellular energy\u2014but as far as DBP is concerned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dust settles , we are also left with a worthless \u201c deglycosylated \u201d DBP molecule .\nWith all of its sugars removed by the Nagalase , there \u2019 s no way DBP can become VDTP/GCMaf .\nThanks to the saboteur Nagalase , all that remains is a useless , sugar-free protein that can \u2019 t be converted into anything of value .\nIt too drifts off into cellular obscurity and eventually gets recycled .\nIn its underhanded effort to subvert the immune army , Nagalase has literally stooped to snatching candy from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) that would have become VDTP/GCMaf has died in utero .\nAnd , Voila !\nThe pathogen has neutralized it \u2019 s enemy \u2019 s immune system .\nThe cancer cell or virus that made the Nagalase has succeeded in neutralizing its archenemy , the macrophage .\nAnd ( as pointed out earlier , but bears repeating ) , when macrophages are de-activated , cell signaling is simultaneously deactivated , so other immune cells ( primarily B- and T- lymphocytes ) stop functioning too .\nAnti-cancer and antimicrobial immune activity have been effectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catalyst\u2014Nagalase performs this malicious ritual over and over and over again , and each time it comes away unscathed and unchanged .\nOne Nagalase molecule can thus destroy a huge quantity of VDTP/GCMaf precursor molecules .\nTo appreciate how precisely Nagalase ( Alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase ) targets VDTP/GCMaf production , imagine a Stinger heat-seeking ground-to-air missile tracking a fighter jet .\nEvasive maneuvers\u2014even by the best pilots\u2014won \u2019 t outsmart the Stinger , which rapidly adjusts its course to track the plane down and blow it up .\nNagalase works the same way : it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DBP ) precursors of VDTP/GCMaf molecules .\nNagalase has no natural enemies .\nNo bodily process , no drug , no treatment could outsmart this diabolical killer .\nSure , high-powered drugs and radiation will take out many of the cancer cells and in some cases produce a cure , but until Dr. Nobuto Yamamoto came along and outed Nagalase , we had no idea as to the actual cause of the immune shutdown that let cancers and viruses go wild .\nDr. Yamamoto \u2019 s schematic diagrams for the production of VDTP/GCMaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of GcMAF from Gc protein ( vitamin D binding protein .\nFIG .\n1B : The deglycosylation of Gc protein by Nagalase ( alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase ) .\n\u201c For a long time we cancer cells had a great job .\nOur Nagalase enzyme Stealth bomber squadrons made it easy to keep cancer going .\nSneaking in under the radar and demolishing VDTP/GCMaf production facilities was our specialty , and\u2014if I say so myself\u2014we were good at it .\nI never missed my target\u2014and I never caused any collateral damage .\nWe shut those VDTP/GCMaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into oblivion .\nAnd we had billions of cancer kills .\n\u201c Without their daily dose of VDTP/GCMaf , those macrophages couldn \u2019 t get out of bed .\nThey didn \u2019 t really have a chance against us .\nIt was a romp !\nCancer ruled !\n\u201c I \u2019 m surprised at how long it took the scientists to unravel our scheme .\nOur killing spree lasted hundreds of years !\nTry and match that !\n!\n!\nLives lost in wars pales in comparison .\nIn fact , we killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wars in history combined .\n\u201c Even when human molecular biologists finally figured out how we operate\u2014 \u2019 cracked the code , \u2019 so to speak\u2014and Dr. Yamamoto outed us by explaining to the world how we did it , it still took them another decade to pay attention and finally shut us down .\nThe cancer establishment didn \u2019 t want to sacrifice their cash cow so , instead of implementing these new discoveries , they still just kept lobbing those silly useless drugs at us .\nAs usual , that slowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took another ten years before they finally started routine Nagalase screening , and then giving weekly VDTP/GCMaf to everyone with an elevated Nagalase .\nWhy did it take them so long to see that fixing the immune system was infinitely preferable to their mostly futile attempts to \u201c shut the barn door after the horses had gotten out , \u201d so to speak .\nGiven half a chance , the body can cure itself .\nBecause of that mistake\u2014and it was a huge one\u2014we killed millions more before they sidelined us .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VDTP/GCMaf and activated macros ?\nWell , I \u2019 m one of the lucky ones , and I must say there are very few of us .\nWhen Dr. Yamamoto discovered Nagalase , I switched sides and changed my identity .\nNow I \u2019 m in a\u2014sort of\u2014witness protection program .\nThe only reason they don \u2019 t kill me is because I \u2019 m useful to them as a mole , a whistle blower \u2026they call it a cancer marker\u2014however you want to put it .\nThe docs test levels of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) cancer or virus is present in my host \u2019 s body .\n\u201c I \u2019 m a fortunate guy .\nBefore VDTP/GCMaf , the cancer cell community adored us Nagalase molecules .\nNow , post-VDTP/GCMaf , I am still a hero , but to the other side .\nNow I help doctors find new cancers and track known ones , so suddenly I went from bad guy to good guy .\nNow , as a spy , I provide you guys , my former enemies , with early warnings that cancer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know whether your treatments are working .\nHere \u2019 s how that works : More of me means more cancer ( or virus ) , for sure .\nAnd less of me means the cancers ( or virus ) are going away .\nIf I appear to be going away but then come back , you \u2019 ll know the cancer or HIV has returned ( i.e.\n, wasn \u2019 t fully killed off ) and my owner person needs another round of VDTP/GCMaf .\nIt \u2019 s a job , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alternatives , well\u2014 like I said\u2014I \u2019 m a lucky guy !\n\u201d Looking at Nagalase from a future perspective : \u201c Back in The Day\u2026 \u201d It is 2020 .\nTwo cancer cells , Jimmy and Jack , are having a chat .\nJimmy \u2019 s the young go-getter and Jack the seasoned but terminally cynical veteran .\nJack , in animated tones , reminisces about the good old days when cancer could wreak havoc\u2026 \u201c I want to tell you about Mickey , the legendary cancer cell who discovered Nagalase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer cells from a minor nuisance up into one of the all-time greatest threats to the survival of humanity .\nOf course , those days are over now , but man , we had quite a run .\nMillions of years and billions of kills !\nNot bad , huh ?\n\u201c Oh , there \u2019 ve been other famous cancers .\nHenrietta Lacks \u2019 immortal cervical cancer cell line comes to mind .\nBut even though he \u2019 s less well-known , Mickey was by far the greatest .\nWith Mickey \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were unstoppable .\nLike Bruce Willis or The Terminator .\nThe oncologists and surgeons and radiologists could aim their peashooters at us all day long \u2014 the chemo , the surgery , the radiation \u2014but , man , we just shrugged them off and kept on comin.\n\u2019 \u201c But it \u2019 s all changed now .\nRight , Jack ?\nI mean , they \u2019 re testing just about everybody for Nagalase now .\nWe don \u2019 t have a chance.\n\u201d Jimmy tentatively intones .\nHe knows a story is coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ancient history , Jimmy , in the stone age of cancer .\nBefore written history , so we don \u2019 t know exactly when .\nAnd how he did it , I don \u2019 t know\u2014in fact nobody knows .\nProbably a mutation in his genome that generated a protein that stopped cancer in its tracks .\nOf course Jimmy \u2019 s contribution\u2014and it \u2019 s not one to be sneered at\u2014was recognizing its value .\nA lesser cancer cell might have received the gift of Nagalase production , but failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He saw that Nagalase stopped the macros in their tracks\u2026 \u201c It \u2019 s so simple .\nNagalase simply breaks a pair of electrons apart .\nThis particular pair of electrons make up a bond that holds a crucial part of the VDTP/GCMaf precursor molecule ( the molecule VDTP/GCMaf is made out of ) together , so the VDTP/GCMaf can \u2019 t be manufactured .\nAalakazam !\n!\n!\nNo more VDTP/GCMaf !\nCan \u2019 t be made because the precursor disintegrated .\nBottom line : no more macro activation , no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story .\nWe win .\n\u201c And Mickey also figured out how to spread the word and make a lot more Nagalase.\n\u201d \u201c By teaching all his friends and neighbors , our distant relatives , how to make it .\nThey just shared the genes for it .\nNo big deal .\nAfter a while , due to Darwinian survival of the fittest , all of our cancer cell brethren that couldn \u2019 t make Nagalase just died off .\nMay they rest in peace .\nWell , actually , they didn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the macros .\nBut the ones that could make Nagalase survived and passed on the gene .\nWe use the humans to carry it around in their DNA .\nThe power to set us free ( and make us dominant ) remained in there , locked into perpetual existence in the human genome , the blueprint for life \u2026and death .\nIt was replicated and passed on from unsuspecting generation to unsuspecting generation inside the humans , and it just sits there in all of their genomes , lying in wait , ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever we get the chance to start growing .\nAnd by smoking , eating pesticides and spewing an enormous array of toxic chemicals into the environment , they gave us plenty of opportunities .\n\u201c Then , back in 2010 , along came VDTP/GCMaf .\nThe docs finally figured out that if they gave people VDTP/GCMaf , it would bypass the Nagalase and activate the macros .\nNow , instead of ruling the roost , we are on the run .\nThe macrophages are everywhere , buzzing around , ganging up on us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hide like in the old days .\nThey can take out brigades of our cells with no effort at all .\nAnd they target the younguns\u2014that \u2019 s not nice !\n\u201c If you ask me , VDTP/GCMaf is cruel and unusual punishment to us cancer cells .\nWe were just doin \u2019 our thing man , if you know what I mean.\n\u201d \u201c But those were the good old days , Jack .\nNow it \u2019 s different and we have to adjust\u2026 \u201d \u201c You \u2019 re right , Jimmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last forever .\nWe have to accept that our run is over , our time has passed .\nNagalase testing has become more popular than cholesterol used to be .\nNowadays , everybody gets tested for Nagalase , starting\u2014can you believe it , in high school ?\nThey find us so early now\u2014and then they pour on the VDTP/GCMaf .\nWe don \u2019 t have a chance anymore .\nUsually the macros nail us so early that we can \u2019 t even metastasize .\nAdding insult to injury , then they monitor us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure we \u2019 re gone .\nNormally , we can \u2019 t get a serious tumor going .\nOur current host , however \u2014man , this dude is clueless .\nFor some reason or other , he hasn \u2019 t gotten tested .\nThat \u2019 s the only reason we \u2019 re alive here , Jimmy .\n\u201c Oh , we still have pollution , toxicity and chemicals on our side , so we \u2019 ll be hanging around in small numbers , generating the occasional new malignant colony , but unless we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nagalase used to be , we are basically toast .\nIt \u2019 s only a matter of time .\nThen , startled , Jimmy screams : \u201c Oh , oh .\nYikes !\n!\n!\n!\nWhat \u2019 s that huge blob coming around the corner of the building over there ?\nIs that what I think it is ?\n\u201d \u201c Dang !\nYup .\nThat \u2019 s a macrophage , son .\nWell , I figured they \u2019 d come after us sooner or later .\nThis guy must have finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat now , Jimmy .\nIt \u2019 s coming to eat us !\n!\n!\nDodge those superoxide radicals , if you can !\nWatch out for that pseudopod !\nIt \u2019 s been nice knowing you , Jimmy .\nArggggh\u2026.\n\u201d Dr. Yamamoto treated 15 HIV patients with VDTP/GCMaf , which eradicated the virus in all cases .\nThese patients went into remission and remained disease free during 7 years of followup .\nTo sabotage the immune system and put macrophages to sleep , all viruses make Nagalase , the enzyme that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the protein that activates macrophages and jump-starts the entire immune response ) HIV and other viruses can grow unimpeded .\nNagalase puts the immune system to sleep .\nDr. Nobuto Yamamoto demonstrated that GcMAF administration bypasses the Nagalase blockage and re-activates the macrophages , which then proceed to kill the HIV viruses and cure the infection .\nSomething to cheer about ?\nPeople infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) have something to get excited about .\nThey just don \u2019 t know it yet .\nIn 2009 Dr. Nobuto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Immunotherapy of HIV-Infected Patients With Gc Protein-Derived Macrophage Activating Factor ( VDTP/GCMaf ) \u201d in the Journal of Medical Virology in which he demonstrated that VDTP/GCMaf cured 100 % of nonanemic HIV infected patients .\nAfter seven years of followup , there were no recurrences .\nAll patients maintained healthy CD+ counts .\nOf course , this is just one study .\nAnd it had the disadvantage of containing some complex molecular biological chemo-speak .\nIf the reader weren \u2019 t familiar with Yamamoto \u2019 s decades of background research ( all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HIV researchers and patients wouldn \u2019 t be likely to read ) , this study would fall on deaf ears .\nBut Professor Yamamoto \u2019 s HIV study was no quirk .\nBased on a quarter-century of solid research that predicted success long before the actual human trials , it presented all the science one would need to understand exactly why these HIV patients were cured .\nThough this study was published in 2009 , there has been no informed discussion on this topic , no further VDTP/GCMaf research as a therapy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It \u2019 s as if this study never happened .\nWhy is this ?\nHIV\u2014like all viruses\u2014makes Nagalase , the enzyme that blocks VDTP/GCMaf production .\nWithout VDTP/GCMaf , macrophages become indolent and the anti-viral immune response shuts down .\nThis allows the HIV infection to spread .\nTo remedy this situation , Dr. Yamamoto simply gave these patients VDTP/GCMaf .\nThis reactivated the sleeping macrophages , which then proceeded to phagocytize all of the viruses .\nThe precise molecular biological pathways and mechanisms involved with HIV , Nagalase , and VDTP/GCMaf are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and need not be repeated here .\nIn his HIV study Yamamoto first showed that HIV patients had high Nagalase levels which correlated with their high HIV RNA levels ( a way to measure the amount of HIV infection ) .\nThen , as he administered VDTP/GCMaf ( 100 ng .\nonce a week for 18 weeks ) , all patients \u2019 Nagalase levels gradually went down to control levels , and , in tandem with the Nagalase , viral load went down to zero .\nYamamoto wrote that these data \u201c suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HIV virions and HIV-infected cells.\n\u201d Professor Yamamoto followed these patients for seven years , and their viral load ( HIV-1 RNA ) , CD4 counts ( helper cells , a type of lymphocyte used to evaluate immunocompetence ) , p24 antigen ( HIV-specific antigen ) , viral culture , and Nagalase levels remained normal .\nAll patients continued to be free of disease .\n( Note : anemic HIV patients were excluded from this study .\nAnemia is common in HIV patients .\nThe effect of VDTP/GCMaf on anemic HIV patients is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is useful both as a screening test for early cancer and for monitoring cancer therapies .\nAMAS is elevated when cancer is present and goes down below baseline when cancer is gone .\nAMAS is over 99 % accurate ( when done twice ) and can be used instead of Nagalase to find and follow cancers .\n( Unlike Nagalase , AMAS does not detect the presence of viruses . )\n\u2022 a naturally occurring antibody present in serum of all people , including children \u2022 positive if any type of cancer exists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 95 % accuracy ; repeat testing greater than 99 % accurate ; false positive and false negative rates less than 1 % \u2022 the earliest anticancer antibody to appear \u2022 detects cancer very early ; your doctor may not be able to find the cancer \u2022 detects cancers long before they appear on imaging \u2022 goes down with successful cancer treatment \u2022 normal levels in successfully treated cancer patients indicates absence of malignancy The AMAS cancer test : an alternative to Nagalase testing Until Nagalase testing becomes available , I recommend the AMAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a test that definitively determines whether or not cancer is present .\nIn this broad-based study ( click on ref 13 ) dozens of researchers and medical centers conclusively demonstrated the value of AMAS as a screening tool for finding cancers early .\nAll cancers make anti-malignin antibody .\nBecause we are making cancer cells all of the time , anti-malignin antibodies are present at low levels in everyone .\nNormally , a healthy immune system ( one with activated macrophages ) is destroying these cancer cells as they are formed .\nAn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 135 , however , tells us that the immune system is not getting rid of those new cancer cells in a timely way , and their numbers are therefore increasing .\nCancer is afoot .\nAMAS is both a cancer screening test and a cancer monitoring test .\nIn other words you can use it to determine whether cancer is present , and you can use it to track therapy .\nThe brainchild of neurochemist Samuel Bogoch , M.D.\n, Ph.D. , AMAS is similar to the PSA for prostate cancer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AMAS simultaneously screens for all cancer types , not just one .\nA positive AMAS will tell you that cancer is present , but it won \u2019 t tell you what kind of cancer it is , and it won \u2019 t tell you where that cancer is located .\n( Not knowing a cancer \u2019 s name and location tends to drive doctors nuts .\n\u201c How can you treat a cancer when you don \u2019 t know what it is or where it is ?\nthey mutter . )\nOur immune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface of cancer cells .\nIn 1988 Dr. Bogoch discovered this antigen and named it \u201c malignin.\n\u201d When our immune system \u201c sees \u201d malignin , it starts making an antibody named anti-malignin antibody .\nDr. Bogoch then developed the AMAS test to identify the presence of cancer by identifying the presence of anti-malignin antibody .\nUsing the AMAS for monitoring cancer When a treatment shrinks a cancer , the AMAS will go down .\nWhether that treatment is surgery , chemo , radiation , an alternative cancer therapy like VDTP/GCMaf , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the AMAS goes down .\nIf cancer remains , the AMAS is positive .\nWhen a cancer is gone ( again , regardless of cause ) , the AMAS reverts to normal .\nAMAS is an extremely precise immunoassay .\nLevels above baseline indicate the presence of cancer with 95 % accuracy on the first testing and over 99 % accuracy when tested twice .\nThe cutoff point for a positive AMAS is 135 .\nMore than 99 % of patients with cancer have AMAS levels above 135 .\nAMAS levels below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not have cancer .\nSequential AMAS levels can also be used to track tumor advancement and the effectiveness of therapies .\nAMAS levels will always increase if cancer is growing and spreading .\nConversely , AMAS levels will decrease if the cancer is being effectively destroyed ( whether by surgery , radiation , chemotherapy , VDTP/GCMaf , or other alternative cancer therapies ) .\nAMAS has identified breast cancers as small as a pencil dot ( too small for any form of imaging ) .\nClinical research data shows that breast cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AMAS returns to normal ( < 135 ) after treatment and that breast cancer can not be presumed to be in remission unless AMAS returns to normal .\nThe usual followup methods for breast cancer include imaging ( CT scans , MRIs , or x-rays ) and hormonal blood tests , looking for signs of cancer after treatment .\nAMAS testing provides a much more accurate way to know whether cancer is still present , and at a fraction of the cost .\nNot to mention the inconvenience .\nAlthough these studies were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no reason to believe that the results would not apply to all types of cancer .\nCancer patients who no longer have evidence of cancer on imaging , but do have a positive AMAS test could nip a returning cancer in the bud by utilizing natural alternative cancer therapies ( including VDTP/GCMaf when it becomes available ) .\nIf a patient has a mass on imaging , the AMAS will tell whether it is malignant or not .\nA negative AMAS means the mass is not cancerous , and therefore a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the AMAS test could thus reduce the pain and suffering of needless biopsies .\nNot to mention the cost .\nAMAS differs from Nagalase in that AMAS is specific for cancer , while Nagalase identifies an enzyme made by both viruses and cancer cells and is therefore unable ( by itself ) to distinguish between the two .\nBecause Nagalase testing can not distinguish the difference between cancer and virus , AMAS is a better screening test for cancer .\nHow to order the AMAS test To order a free AMAS kit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ https : //www.oncolabinc.com .\nAMAS is a product of Oncolab , Inc. , 36 The Fenway , Boston , MA 02215 .\nPhone : 617-536-0850 .\nAccording to Oncolab : The AMAS test \u201c should be used in the context of good clinical judgment by a physician experienced in the treatment of cancer.\n\u201d \u201c A normal AMAS level can occur in non-cancer , in terminal cancer , and in successfully treated cancer in which there is no further evidence of disease ; clinical status must be used to distinguish these states.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the AMAS test is not by itself diagnostic of the presence or absence of disease , and its results can only be assessed as an aid to diagnosis , detection or monitoring of disease in relation to the history , medical signs and symptoms and the overall condition of the patient.\n\u201d Dr. Bogoch has shown that purified AMAS kills cancer cells in a test tube .\nFrom this research a future treatment can be developed in which injections of anti-malignin antibody would be used to treat cancer .\nDr. Bogoch \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopefully someday be recognized with a Nobel Prize .\nThis chapter will show you how to use AMAS testing , Nagalase testing , and viral antibody testing to determine whether you have cancer .\nIf you do have cancer , you \u2019 ll learn how to track your treatment program to make sure it is working .\nIt is important to appreciate the fact that both cancers and viruses make Nagalase .\nTherefore , a positive Nagalase test result tells us both cancer and/or virus could be present , but it doesn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be easily solved .\nSince the AMAS test is specific for cancer ( and not viral infections ) , a positive AMAS tells us cancer caused the Nagalase to go up .\nViral antibody testing can also be used to rule specific viruses in or out .\nThus the combination of AMAS and viral screening will effectively sort through the possibilities presented by a positive Nagalase test .\nHere is a summary of what each test will tell you : \u2022 A positive Nagalase test indicates presence of either a a cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2022 AMAS testing ( now available ) indicates presence of cancer ( only ) .\n\u2022 Viral antibody testing ( now available ) indicates presence of specific viruses ( see list below ) .\n\u2022 Appropriate combinations of these three tests will sort through the possibilities and identify the actual cause of the disease .\nUsing Nagalase to screen for cancer In the ( hopefully not-too-distant ) future , once Nagalase testing and VDTP/GCMaf are available , all people at risk of cancer\u2014i.e.\n, everyone over the age of 40\u2014will get an annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood tests ( complete blood count , comprehensive metabolic panel , vitamin D , lipid panel , etc. )\n.\nNagalase will become our standard marker for early cancer detection .\nThose with an elevated Nagalase ( after ruling out a viral cause ; see below ) will be treated \u201c presumptively \u201d ( i.e.\n, we know it \u2019 s in there even though we can \u2019 t actually see it ) with VDTP/GCMaf and/or other alternative cancer therapies .\nFollowup Nagalase testing will document the patient \u2019 s progress .\nOnce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a return of Nagalase to baseline , subsequent testing will provide an early warning if cancer starts growing again .\nUsing Nagalase to track effectiveness of cancer therapy The more cancer cells present in the body , the more Nagalase they generate .\nThus , Nagalase is the perfect marker for determining response to cancer therapies because , in a given patient , tumor burden will always be proportional to the Nagalase level .\nIn cancer patients , a declining Nagalase level reflects a reduction in total tumor \u201c load \u201d or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower Nagalase after chemo , radiation , or surgery because these treatments all reduce tumor burden .\nHaving used these therapies does not mean the disease is gone , however .\nA very low ( baseline ) Nagalase level would indicate the cancer has been cured .\nIf there is even a remote chance of metastatic disease\u2014as indicated by an elevated Nagalase level\u2014it would be wise to use VDTP/GCMaf to activate the immune system so it can find and polish off any remaining cancer cells .\nRepeat testing with declining levels would indicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AMAS to screen for cancer The AMAS test ( Anti-Malignin Antibody in Serum ) measures serum levels of AMA , an antibody found to be elevated in 99 % of patients with active malignancies .\nUntil Nagalase is available , I recommend the AMAS as a screening test for all people over 40 .\nSee Chapter 13 for a complete description of the AMAS test .\nUsing AMAS to track effectiveness of cancer therapy Tumors produce AMAS in direct proportion to their size , so declining AMAS levels indicate the cancer is shrinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIncreasing AMAS levels , on the other hand , indicate cancer growth and that a different treatment approach should be considered .\n( At least three AMAS tests are required to establish a pattern . )\nUsing AMAS to determine whether a positive Nagalase indicates presence of cancer or virus .\nSince all viruses and all cancers make Nagalase , an elevated Nagalase level could be caused by either .\nAMAS testing , however is specific for cancer ( i.e.\n, tells us nothing about viruses ) .\nSo an elevated Nagalase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infection .\nIf , conversely , both Nagalase and AMAS are elevated , you know you are dealing with cancer .\nA negative AMAS coupled with a positive Nagalase indicates the presence of a viral infection .\nAnti- viral antibody testing will identify the specific virus .\nEach virus generates its own specific antibodies .\nThe most common chronic viral infections are listed below .\nAntibody testing is available for each : Conventional medicine continues to prefer to wait until imaging reveals both the presence and location of a cancer before acknowledging its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occult \u201d cancers\u2014the ones that can \u2019 t be \u201c seen , \u201d but testing says they \u2019 re in there somewhere\u2014the best course of action is to treat \u201c presumptively.\n\u201d In this situation , a positive Nagalase and/or AMAS testing has told us cancer is present , so we \u201c presume \u201d the presence of cancer , and then go ahead and treat it even though it \u2019 s still too small to be seen on imaging .\nAn AMAS test done twice and positive both times identifies the presence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive Nagalase ( once this test becomes available ) coupled with a positive AMAS would also constitute convincing evidence of an occult cancer .\nIf the treatment works , we may never actually see the cancer .\nThis may trouble some physicians , but ask yourself this question : would you rather remove a small cancer with natural , harmless medicine , and never get to see it\u2014or would you prefer to wait until the malignancy enlarges to the point where it \u2019 ll show up on a CAT scan , which means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , surgery , radiation , and chemotherapy ?\nHello ?\n15 : Eradicating the Scourge of Cancer from the Face of the Earth We can get rid of cancer once and for all .\nWe now possess the scientific understanding necessary to accomplish this .\nI want to abolish cancer .\nThis goal may seem impossible , but it \u2019 s not .\nEarly stage cancers are a lot easier to treat , so catching a malignancy early ( when it is < 5 mm , too small to be seen on imaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eradication strategy .\nBy the time a cancer is big enough to be seen on a CAT scan , it \u2019 s too late to rely solely on natural medicines .\nThe conventional options have become necessary : some combination of surgery , radiation , and/or chemotherapy .\n( Of course , alternative methods still can and should play an important adjunctive role , but no responsible alternative oncologist would recommend bypassing the usual mainstream therapies . )\nSo the trick to reversing cancer is to catch it early .\nThat \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , non-invasive , immune-supportive options work best .\nThat \u2019 s when VDTP/GCMaf works best .\nWhen VDTP/GCMaf becomes available , we have every reason to expect that it \u2019 s effectiveness in small early cancers will approach 100 % .\nWe just need to find them .\nHow ?\nNagalase screening .\nElevated Nagalase levels ( repeat testing is necessary to make sure the level is going up ) reveal the presence of cancers when they are still extremely small .\nAt this early stage , a few months of weekly VDTP/GCMaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reactivate the macrophages and eliminate the cancer .\nApplying the strategy of 1 . )\nannual Nagalase testing in large populations with 2 . )\nweekly VDTP/GCMaf therapy for those who test positive has the potential to obliterate the scourge of cancer from the face of the earth .\nConventional doctors are going to have to let go of their need to see a cancer on an X-ray before treating it .\nIn the nano-world of molecular medicine we can now contemplate a patient \u2019 s \u201c metabolic landscape \u201d to spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or future disease .\nSeveral examples are provided .\nTests like AMAS ( now ) and Nagalase ( in the future ) track the molecular biological footprints of malignancy , enabling diagnosis and initiation of treatment much earlier in the evolution of the disease\u2014long before imaging could detect a mass .\nLet me take a brief detour here to address the issue of doctors who are uncomfortable treating a cancer that is too small to see on imaging .\nIn order to feel okay about treating , these guys really need visual\u2014and just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this , the dawning new age of molecular medicine , however , the zone between no disease and clear-cut , palpable , imageable disease is becoming increasingly blurry .\nThanks to sophisticated testing and a deeper understanding of the molecular biology of pathological processes , we are now able to \u201c see \u201d the earliest stages of disease\u2014and even the preexisting biochemical landscape that sets the stage for it\u2014long before we can pin down its location with imaging ( X-rays , CAT Scans , and MRIs ) .\nMy advice to doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of disease is this : get over it !\nWe have entered the nano-age of molecular medicine , where we can detect the earliest stages of disease via biochemical changes .\nIn the olden days ( ten years ago ) imaging and palpating disease were the best we had , but these modalities have become increasingly archaic as genetics and molecular biological testing pave the way to earlier identification of pathological changes , allowing us to reverse disease while it is still in the formative stages , before symptoms appear .\nAs a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing will become the new cholesterol , the screening test for cancer that will be part of regular blood testing .\nUsing elevated Nagalase and AMAS levels , we will be able to treat and reverse tumors we never get to actually see\u2014much less biopsy .\nVia molecular medicine testing we can now contemplate a patient \u2019 s \u201c metabolic landscape \u201d examining subtle genetic and biochemical markers that are signposts pointing to a currently developing or even a future disease .\nFor example : A low DHEA-S ( an adrenal hormone ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body ) level , for example , tells us this person is not capable of managing stress very well , and thus prone to cancer , allergies , autoimmune disease , and other immunological disorders .\nBecause of their compromised ability to manage all kinds of stress ( toxic , inflammatory , infectious , allergic , chemical , traumatic , emotional ) individuals with low DHEA levels have shorter lifespans .\nAn elevated MCV ( mean corpuscular volume above 90 ) on a simple CBC ( complete blood count ) tells us the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acid deficiency .\nUntreated , this significantly raises risk for a host of diseases including cardiovascular disease ( heart attack , stroke , senile brain disease ) , neurological diseases ( depression , dementia ) , and all cancers .\nThe vitamin D deficient individual is a sitting duck for cancer , diabetes , autoimmune disease , osteoporosis , and a host of other afflictions .\nVitamin D deficiency very common ( over 70 % of Americans have one ) and is a sure sign of dramatically higher risk of neoplasm .\nIdeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put one at 400 % baseline risk for all types of cancer .\nTesting is the only way to determine deficiency .\nThough 10,000 IU a day would be a reasonable dose for someone who is deficient ( below 50 ) , testing is required to determine optimum dose .\nA positive AMAS ( Anti-Malignin Antibody , Serum ) test tells us cancer is absolutely present .\n( See Chapter 13 . )\nAMAS measures antibodies the immune system makes in response to cancer cell antigens .\nThis test is 95 % accurate\u201499 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( enzyme made by cancer cells and viruses that protects them by shutting down the immune response ) tells us a cancer or virus is brewing .\nThe lipid panel is a really lousy marker for cardiovascular disease .\nHalf of all people with an elevated cholesterol never have a heart attack or stroke .\nHalf of people who get a stroke or heart attack have a normal cholesterol .\nNevertheless , doctors pay literal homage to an elevated cholesterol by whipping off the obligatory prescription for a statin drug ; treating it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something in the bud , even though they have not a clue about where that bud might be located .\nSo why do doctors ignore\u2014even fear\u2014the AMAS and Nagalase tests that would do the same thing for cancer that cholesterol does for cardiovascular disease ?\nIt just doesn \u2019 t make sense .\n( Sometimes , in my darker moments , I wonder if the availability\u2014or lack thereof\u2014of a drug for the abnormal marker might have something to do with it ? )\nTreating abnormal lab results ( rather than positive imaging or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treating earlier and earlier in the disease process .\nAs in the examples above , we can detect and reverse a disease with diet , exercise , and nutritional supplements if we catch it early enough .\nThe longer we wait to get the \u201c old-time \u201d diagnosis , the more advanced the disease and the more extreme the treatment measures must be .\nIn terms of cancer , the bottom line here is that practicing the best possible medicine will force us to dispense with the luxury of palpating the mass or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be lost if we stay stuck in that groove .\nThe best doctors will be using newer biochemical techniques to find disease early .\nWhen rising Nagalase levels expose these early occult cancers , the first line of therapy will be VDTP/GCMaf ( 100 ng/week , intramuscularly ) , along with immune strengthening , anti-cancer nutritional medicines .\nIf the VDTP/GCMaf program works , the Nagalase level ( which should be checked monthly ) will go down and the doctor and patient can rest assured that the cancer is going away .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAs mentioned above , it may seem bizarre and surreal to be treating a cancer that is still invisible , but this is exactly what is happening\u2014and it works .\nDr. Yamamoto \u2019 s studies showed that with VDTP/GCMaf it works 100 % of the time .\nOnce Nagalase testing is available ( and physicians have learned how to use it ) , the rules for treating cancer will change .\nNagalase testing will not only permit extremely early detection of the presence of cancer cells , it \u2019 ll also give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is ( we call this \u201c load \u201d or \u201c burden \u201d ) .\nAnd it can accomplish these daunting tasks before the tumor has expanded to the point where imaging can blow its cover .\nGuidance in this process by a trained professional is absolutely crucial .\nTrying to be your own plumber may work at times\u2014a leaky faucet probably won \u2019 t kill you\u2014but in matters of life and death , it is absolutely essential to have experienced guidance .\nIn the early days of VDTP/GCMaf availability , until proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is experienced in the use of VDTP/GCMaf and Nagalase testing will be challenging .\nCancer cell \u201c differentiation.\n\u201d About cancer grading .\nMacrophages easily find undifferentiated cells because they display a higher degree of cell surface abnormality .\nVDTP/GCMaf cure rates depend on the degree of cancer cell membrane abnormality , which corresponds to the grade of differentiation of malignant cells .\nUnder a microscope cancer cells don \u2019 t look like normal cells In order to understand how cancers are graded , we need to have a short talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ripe banana .\nAs it gradually goes bad , first a few minor brown spots appear on the surface .\nThen , as it approaches inedibility , it looks more and more rotten and it becomes progressively easier to make that determination .\nCancer cells are like that .\nAs the cancer progresses , the cells look ( to macrophages ) increasingly weirder and weirder , and as a consequence they become progressively easier to identify\u2014and kill .\nHere \u2019 s how it works\u2026 As they mature , normal cells \u201c differentiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are different : they do not differentiate into mature specialized cells ; they remain immature-looking .\nCancer specialists therefore call them \u201c undifferentiated.\n\u201d Well-differentiated ( i.e.\n, early stage ) cancer cells look almost normal , but poorly-differentiated ( more immature ) cells do not look at all like normal cells .\nThey look like more and more like cancer cells .\nAdvanced cancers consist mostly of poorly differentiated ( immature looking ) or undifferentiated cells .\nWhen macrophages are activated , they develop very large numbers of surface receptors that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then latch onto them .\nSince undifferentiated cancer cells have more surface irregularities , they are easier to locate .\nWhen the activated macrophages find them\u2014well , by now you know the drill .\nThe above facts are useful when trying to understand cancer grading .\nDegree of differentiation provides information about cancer aggressiveness and progression because the more normal ( i.e.\n, differentiated ) a cancer cell looks , the lower its grade .\nThe more abnormal or less well developed ( i.e.\n, undifferentiated ) a cancer cell appears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several grading systems , depending on the institution doing the grading and the tumor type .\nHere is a description of a typical three-tier grading system : \u2022 Grade 1 : low grade or well differentiated cancer cells still look a lot like normal cells .\nThese cancers are usually slow growing .\n\u2022 Grade 2 : intermediate/moderate grade or moderately differentiated cancer cells do not look like normal cells .\nThey are growing somewhat faster than normal cells .\n\u2022 Grade 3 : high grade or poorly differentiated cancer cells do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are fast-growing or \u201c aggressive.\n\u201d There is never any absolute certainty about how cancer cells will behave , but grade is a useful indicator .\nA low grade cancer will grow more slowly and be less likely to spread than a high grade one .\nOncologists take cancer grade into consideration when pondering treatment decisions .\nWhy is differentiation important in terms of VDTP/GCMaf ?\nThe more undifferentiated a cancer cell is , the easier it is for VDTP/GCMaf -activated macrophages to find it .\nLike an advanced cancer cell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? )\nstands out in a huge crowd because he looks different .\nIf Waldo were a cancer cell , activated macros would find him easily and he \u2019 d be toast in minutes ; his little red and white striped shirt and funny glasses would be all that would be left behind .\nThe weirder the cancer cell looks , the easier the macros can recognize and destroy them .\nUndifferentiated ( i.e.\n, advanced or aggressive cancer cells ) have more abnormalities on their cell surfaces , so\u2014to activated macrophages\u2014they look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well-differentiated cancer cells with fewer surface abnormalities .\nTherefore , undifferentiated cancer cells are more rapidly killed by activated macrophages because they \u201c stand out \u201d ( like Waldo ) in the crowd .\nWhen macros are activated by VDTP/GCMaf , their genome dramatically upregulates expression of the receptor proteins that identify cancer cells .\nMore receptors translates into more \u201c detectives \u201d looking for Waldo , so he is lots easier to find .\nDr. Yamamoto showed that cancer cell surface abnormalities manifested a high correlation with VDTP/GCMaf effectiveness .\nHe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases in numbers of macrophage cell surface receptors that recognize a wide variety of cancer cell surface abnormalities .\nin his 2008 paper on breast cancer Dr. Yamamoto describes these phenomena as follows : \u201c Thus , the macrophages activated by VDTP/GCMaf developed enormous variation of receptor that recognize a variety of microbial agents ( e.g.\n, bacteria and viruses ) and abnormalities in malignant cell surfaces .\nThis fundamental nature of macrophages to recognize cell surface abnormality ( nonselfing nature ) is universal to all types of cancers .\nIn fact weekly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients showed curative effects on a variety of cancers .\nTypes of cancer so far tested are prostate , breast , colon , stomach , liver , lung ( including mesothelioma ) , kidney , bladder , uterus , ovarian , head/neck , brain cancers , melanoma and fibrosarcoma .\nEfficacy of VDTP/GCMaf therapy for cancers depends on the degree of cell membrane abnormality .\nPrecision of measurement of Nagalase activity allowed us to determine the degree of cell surface abnormality by the curative rate during VDTP/GCMaf therapy .\nUndifferentiated tumor cells are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact adenocarcinoma such as breast and prostate cancer cells are undifferentiated and killed rapidly by the activated macrophages whereas well-differentiated cancer cells such as squamous carcinoma cells are slowly killed by the activated macrophages .\nThis curative rate appears to depend on both the amount of receptors for the particular antigen on macrophages and the amount of antigens on each cell.\n\u201d ( Int .\nJ .\nCancer : 122 , 461\u2013467 ( 2008 ) .\nImmunotherapy of

cancer continuum for VDTP/GCMAF therapy .\nThe bigger a cancer gets the less likely VDTP/GCMAF will work .\nTracking effectiveness of all cancer therapies with Nagalase and AMAS .\nAn expanding tumor sooner or later reaches a \u201c point of no return.\n\u201d One could view the life of any cancer as a continuum starting with one cell ( on the far left side ) and continuing through growth and metastasis and finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a massive complex of metastatic tumors comprised of many billions of cells , occupying multiple locations in the body \u2014a cancer that has become large enough to overwhelm and kill its host .\nCancer specialists \u201c stage \u201d cancer according to where it lies on this continuum .\nMalignant tumors begin with one cancer cell .\nThis cell multiplies by dividing to become an expanding tumor mass .\nAt first , like termites in your house , cancers persistently gnaw away , expanding and encroaching .\nThey capture territory by spreading locally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they break through the barriers that keep them local and spill over into the local lymph channels ( which try to contain them ) .\nAgain , if unchecked , the cancer cells next manage to crash the barriers to the bloodstream , which , like enemy submarines , they silently navigate to far- flung regions of the body where they spawn new colonies .\nUp to this point the body \u2019 s cancer containment barriers have worked .\nBy breaking out , the cancer has become the insidious , most feared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prior to metastasis , almost all cancers are considered curable .\nAfter metastasis , the odds of a cure plummet .\nBut even now , at this , the metastatic stage , oncologists continue lobbing chemotherapeutic bombs and radiologists still blast away with particle beams .\nIn the current system , these well-intended efforts are for the most part futile : metastatic cancer may be slowed but is rarely cured .\nBut as you will see , the standard therapies that reduce tumor burden greatly improve the odds that VDTP/GCMAF will be effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cancer Optimum treatment strategies vary depending on the type and stage of the cancer .\nIn the earliest stage , prior to detection on imaging ( but positive on AMAS or Nagalase ) , alternative treatment approaches work best .\nThis is true because natural therapies enhance the body \u2019 s own anti-cancer systems rather than damaging them .\nBy the time a cancer has grown to the size where it can be seen on imaging , however , the \u201c toxic triad \u201d ( surgery , radiation , and/or chemotherapy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any therapy , including VDTP/GCMAF , has everything to do with the point along this continuum at which treatment is initiated .\nEarly detection has justifiably become the gospel of cancer therapy .\nThe sooner a cancer is detected , regardless of type , the better the prognosis .\nCatching a cancer before it metastasizes is especially important .\nWe want to move the point of detection as far to the left as we can .\nAMAS and Nagalase testing will do that .\nIn \u201c metastatic \u201d disease the tumor has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chemo and radiation have not succeeded at containment .\nPandora \u2019 s Box is now wide open .\nThese are the patients on whom Dr. Yamamoto chose to focus : the ones with demonstrable early metastatic disease ( defined by the presence of Nagalase ) but for whom the standard therapies had failed .\nWeekly intramuscular injections of 100 nanograms ( 100 billionths of a gram ; you \u2019 d need a powerful microscope to be able to see it ! )\nfor 3-6 months cured every single one of these \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work pushed the envelope in that he cured carefully chosen early stage metastatic cancers .\nAs tumor size and metastases increase , the chance of success with VDTP/GCMAF declines .\nWith larger ( greater than 2 cm . )\nmetastatic tumors , VDTP/GCMAF may not work or a longer duration of treatment may be required .\nThe probability of success with VDTP/GCMAF can be improved by reducing tumor burden via chemo , radiation , and surgery .\nSooner or later , however , as a cancer continues to grow , even large numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be enough to carry the day .\nChoice of cancer stage had everything to do with Yamamoto \u2019 s success Why did Dr. Yamamoto choose to treat patients at the point in the cancer continuum where conventional therapies had failed ?\nObviously , if conventional therapies had cured these cancers , there would be no further need for VDTP/GCMAF or any other treatment .\nYamamoto chose this group of patients because he knew that VDTP/GCMAF would be most effective in patients with low tumor burden who had flunked the mainstream approach and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elevated Nagalase levels told him that metastatic disease continued to lurk somewhere in these patients \u2019 bodies .\nAll cancer cells make Nagalase ( and normal cells never make it ) , so the presence of Nagalase is synonymous with the presence of cancer .\nYamamoto also knew that larger tumors would be harder for VDTP/GCMAF -activated macrophages to vanquish , so he chose patients in whom the bulk of the cancers had been removed and in whom there was great reason to believe that the \u201c tumor burden \u201d \u2014though metastatic\u2014was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s research patients had special advantages .\nFirst , they were in the earliest stage of metastatic disease .\nSecond\u2014because they had endured the appropriate conventional combination of therapies\u2014their \u201c total tumor burden \u201d ( the number of cancer cells remaining after surgery , radiation , and/or chemotherapy ) was very low .\nAs a consequence , VDTP/GCMAF-activated macrophages were given a huge advantage .\nThe ratio of activated macrophages to cancer cells was high , and so the macros had no trouble polishing off their cancer meal .\nYamamoto \u2019 s stroke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients at the point on the cancer continuum where VDTP/GCMAF would exert the greatest impact .\nThis point\u2014early metastatic disease with recently minimized tumor burden\u2014thus provided VDTP/GCMAF with a tremendous likelihood of a cure .\nAnd that \u2019 s exactly what happened\u2014in every single case .\nIf he had treated earlier\u2014before standard therapies had had their chance to succeed or fail\u2014he would not have known for sure whether or not these patients even had metastatic disease .\nIf he had waited longer to treat , he would given the shrunken tumors time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thus would have risked losing some of the patients .\nThe \u201c point of no return \u201d Individual cancers are difficult to categorize and impossible to quantify , so we are dealing with probabilities here .\nAt some point , however , the cancer and/or its metastases will gain enough mass to be able to thwart the best efforts of debulking followed by VDTP/GCMAF .\nThis is where the cancer shrugs off the VDTP/GCMAF effect because it has now grown to that size at which it is now adding new cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them .\nThe meal is just too big .\nI call this the \u201c point of no return.\n\u201d It \u2019 s a cancer cliff , so to speak , beyond which no amount of VDTP/GCMAF could rescue the patient .\nIn some cases surgical removal , radiation and/or chemotherapy might debulk the tumor back down to a size where the VDTP/GCMAF could be effective .\nThese kinds of decisions would obviously have to be made by an oncologist experienced in VDTP/GCMAF therapy .\nIs VDTP/GCMAF

AMAS cancer screening test . )\nIs VDTP/GCMAF effective in early small cancers large enough to show up on imaging ?\nWe also don \u2019 t know how effective VDTP/GCMAF would be in early disease , but there is excellent reason to believe\u2014based on Dr. Yamamoto \u2019 s studies\u2014that all , or almost all , early small tumors that have not yet metastasized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VDTP/GCMAF .\nBased on the outcomes reported in Dr. Yamamoto \u2019 s studies , effectiveness would approach 100 % for cancers that have been recently debulked and are in the early stages of metastasis when VDTP/GCMAF therapy has been begun .\nDr. Nobuto Yamamoto \u2019 s human studies focused only on the early group .\nWe have no research-derived data addressing the issue of VDTP/GCMAF effectiveness in more advanced cancers .\nThe studies have not yet done , and we don \u2019 t know how advanced a cancer might be and still respond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great variability from one patient to another .\nTracking effectiveness of all cancer therapies with Nagalase and AMAS If cancer is present , Nagalase and/or AMAS will be positive .\nNagalase and AMAS are not only qualitative markers , however , they are also quantitative\u2014by which I mean rising or falling levels tell us what the cancer is up to .\nNagalase/AMAS can therefore be used to monitor the effectiveness of any cancer treatment , including both drug and alternative therapies , separately or in combination .\nNagalase , AMAS and the \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with VDTP/GCMAF treatment , serial Nagalase ( or AMAS ) levels will decrease over

return \u201d before VDTP/GCMAF therapy had been initiated , the Nagalase and AMAS levels might drop initially but eventually would continue rising , indicating the VDTP/GCMAF-activated macrophages

with cancer patients .\nPlease see this overall guide on suggested doses .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it \u2019 s a lung cancer* , other cancers have the same protocols : Administration is via Injecting I.M or Sub C using a small gauge needle and a 0.5ml or a 1ml syringe .\n1ml of VDTP/GcMaf per day , from a 7500ng vial ( 3000ng a day ) Total of 12 vials of 7500ng for the month .\n0.5ml of VDTP/GcMaf per day , from a 7500ng vial ( 1500ng a day ) Total of 12 vials of 7500ng for two months ( 6 vials per month ) .\nOver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 24 vials of the 7500ng vials .\nStage 2 through to Late stage Cancer .\nAdministration is via Injecting I.M or Sub C using a small gauge needle and a 1ml syringe .\n1ml of VDTP/GcMaf per day , from a 7500ng vial ( 3000ng per day ) 12 vials are required a Month , so 36 vials are required for 3 months \u2019 supply .\nLung cancer , we suggest nebulising1500ng ml daily and injecting 1500ng which is a total of 1ml daily from a 7500ng vial .\n12 vials are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 3 months \u2019 supply .\nAll patients were given intramuscular ( IM ) injections of pure VDTP/GCMAF .\nIM injections are necessary because oral administration would expose the VDTP/GCMAF protein molecule to gastric hydrochloric acid and pancreatic protease enzymes , resulting in degradation and deactivation .\nIn Dr. Yamamoto \u2019 s studies the duration of treatment varied from patient to patient and disorder to disorder : \u2022 100 % of nonanemic HIV patients were cured in less than 18 weeks .\n\u2022 100 % of nonanemic early metastatic breast cancer patients were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % of nonanemic early metastatic colorectal cancer patients were cured in 32-50 weeks .\n\u2022 100 % of nonanemic early metastatic prostate cancer patents were cured in 14-25 weeks .\nThere has never been an adverse reaction , side effect , or toxic reaction to pure VDTP/GCMAF .\nBecause its molecular structure is identical to VDTP/GCMAF made by the body ( i.e.\n, bioidentical ) , there is absolutely no reason to expect that pure VDTP/GCMAF would cause any kind of problem .\nOur genetic program contains the code for building VDTP/GCMAF molecules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the genes for VDTP/GCMAF production are \u201c expressed , \u201d and ongoing VDTP/GCMAF production makes sure our macrophages are continuously activated so that they can effectively address the ongoing onslaught of bacteria , viruses , parasites , and newly forming cancer cells .\nWhen viruses and cancer cells obstruct VDTP/GCMAF production by releasing Nagalase , this finely tuned mechanisms breaks down , VDTP/GCMAF dwindles , and macrophages slow down and stop .\nNow the welcome mat is out , the door is open , and the intruders come marching right in .\nReplacing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molecule that is missing guarantees there will be no adverse reactions .\nThe administration of impure ( non-bioidentical or contaminated ) VDTP/GCMAF carries a high potential for side effects and adverse reactions .\nIt also might not work .\nIn Chapter 21 I address the challenging problem of bootlegs , counterfeits , knockoffs , wannabes\u2014and certification to ensure purity .\nThe importance of a establishing a VDTP/GCMAF certifying authority can not be overstated ; a market flooded with ineffective products would provide authorities with a good reason to shut down all production .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ be effective : Protease inhibitors \u2013 VDTP/GCMAF might not work for HIV patients taking protease inhibitors .\nIn macrophage phagolysosomes , proteases work to digest cancer cells and viruses .\nProtease inhibition might interfere with phagolysosomal protease activity , slowing digestion of phagocytized invaders , thus indirectly obstructing the macrophage activating effect of the VDTP/GCMAF .\nAnemia \u2013 A lack of sufficient red blood cells may compromise VDTP/GCMAF effectiveness .\nAnemic patients were excluded from all of Dr. Yamamoto \u2019 s studies .\nInsufficient macrophages \u2013 If a person doesn \u2019 t have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells that become macrophages ) , they might not respond as briskly to VDTP/GCMAF as a person with normal macrophage/monocyte levels .\nPatients with low white cell counts ( or compromised immune functioning ) should take hydrolyzed whey protein which will encourage the bone marrow to make more white blood cells .\nMake sure you purchase cold processed \u201c hydrolyzed \u201d whey protein marketed by a company that specializes in supplying nutritional medicines to physicians ( Pure Encapsulations would be an excellent choice ) .\nThe whey protein found in health food stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective .\nGood intentions coupled with poor training can lead to disaster .\nAnyone who allows a novice to administer VDTP/GCMAF is making a big mistake .\nOnce available , VDTP/GCMAF administration must always be monitored by a physician trained in its use .\nRather than a substitute for conventional cancer therapy , VDTP/GCMAF is an adjunct to it .\nVDTP/GCMAF effectiveness depends on optimum administration of conventional mainstream cancer therapies .\nSubstituting VDTP/GCMAF for conventional therapies for an imageable cancer could result in a preventable death .\nMedically unsupervised administration of VDTP/GCMAF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following reasons : \u2022 VDTP/GCMAF effectiveness depends on optimum administration of conventional mainstream cancer therapies .\nTumor debulking using surgery , chemotherapy , and/or radiation\u2014is crucial because VDTP/GCMAF works best on smaller cancers .\nDebulking moves the patient back from the point of no return .\n\u2022 Physicians are necessary to diagnose and treat concomitant medical disorders .\n\u2022 Your doctor will need to monitor progress by checking AMAS or Nagalase levels ( when available ) in order to determine whether or not the VDTP/GCMAF is working , and to know when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2022 Cancer imaging , ordered and interpreted by physicians , provides crucial information about cancer progress .\n20 : Why Not Skip Conventional Cancer Therapies and Just Take VDTP/GCMAF ?\nWhy not just skip the surgery , radiation , and chemo and use VDTP/GCMAF all by itself ?\nSome cancer patients\u2014in the hopes of sidestepping the slash , burn , and toxic discomforts of surgery , radiation , and chemotherapy\u2014might consider opting for VDTP/GCMAF therapy all by itself .\nIf VDTP/GCMAF works , they ask , why bother with the nasty stuff ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients this certainly would be a very bad idea .\nHere \u2019 s why : VDTP/GCMAF works better on smaller tumors .\nDespite the many drawbacks of the \u201c big three , \u201d they all reduce tumor mass .\nThe basic idea here is that activated macrophages gobble up cancer cells , but\u2014as with your lunch \u2014the less you have to eat , the quicker and easier you can finish the meal .\nAnd just as there is an upper limit to the size of a meal you could consume , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumor material even the most aggressively activated macrophages can polish off .\nThink about it : the bigger the mess , the more sponges you \u2019 d need to clean it up .\nSame \u2019 s true for cancer .\nSurgery , radiation , and chemo all diminish the size of the tumor and/or its metastases ( this is called \u201c debulking \u201d ) .\nSmaller tumors are easier targets for the VDTP/GCMAF-activated macrophages because with fewer cancer cells to devour , their workload is lightened .\nSo , you cancer patients dreaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cure , listen up : avoiding the recommended conventional treatments for your cancer would not be a wise move .\nUsing VDTP/GCMAF on a debulked , smaller tumor may make the difference between cure and no cure .\nAnother faulty line of reasoning might go something like this : \u201c I could try the VDTP/GCMAF alone , and if it doesn \u2019 t work , then I can still go back and do the surgery , chemo , and/or radiation.\n\u201d This approach might prove foolhardy because waiting could allow cancer growth beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reversible .\nAgain , it \u2019 s best to go with the \u201c debulk first \u201d strategy .\nIt was no accident that Dr. Yamamoto chose to limit his groundbreaking human research to cancer patients who had recently received optimum \u201c debulking \u201d procedures .\nEach of the breast , prostate , and colorectal cancer patients to whom he administered VDTP/GCMAF had recently completed the appropriate mainstream course of treatment for their cancer .\nSurgery , radiation , and/or chemo ( in whichever combination was indicated in that particular patient \u2019 s cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients still had elevated Nagalase levels , he knew they had metastatic disease .\nThe conventional therapies had not cured them .\nThe patients had , however , been \u201c debulked , \u201d and this made a huge difference in the ability of the VDTP/GCMAF to do its job .\nYamamoto thus proved that combining mainstream debulking therapies with VDTP/GCMAF could produce a cure in 100 % of early metastatic cancer patients in whom the conventional therapies alone had failed .\nHad Yamamoto chosen identical patients ( in terms of cancer type and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the conventional therapies , he almost certainly would have had some failures .\nHad he waited months or years for these uncured cancer patients \u2019 tumors to return ( to \u201c re-bulk , \u201d as it were ) , again , his cure rate would certainly have been lower .\nDebulking works , is an important feature in the curative process , and should not be avoided or delayed in the hopes that VDTP/GCMAF will accomplish the job all by itself .\nOne who proceeds down this avenue risks losing the chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by VDTP/GCMAF\u2014might have provided .\nThe above logic also applies to HIV .\nUsing appropriate drug cocktails to reduce HIV viral load will give VDTP/GCMAF a big head start in terms of devouring the remaining viruses , and this could make the difference between cure and no cure , between life or death .\n( Because protease inhibition might interfere with VDTP/GCMAF effectiveness , it will probably prove necessary to discontinue protease inhibitors while on VDTP/GCMAF therapy .\nHIV patients\u2014once VDTP/GCMAF is available\u2014will need to discuss these concerns with their physician . )\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ early cancers too small to image In the earliest stages of cancer , when the mass is still very small ( < 5 mm ) , the \u201c debulk first \u201d requirement does not hold .\nIf a patient knows from an elevated Nagalase level that he or she has a cancer growing somewhere , but it is not big enough to be seen on imaging and there are no localizing tests like a positive PSA ( prostate ) , BrCA1 or 2 ( breast ) , or CA-125 ( ovarian ) to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone would be advisable .\nIf , over time , the Nagalase ( or AMAS ) levels drop back to normal , one can assume the cancer was \u201c nipped in the bud , \u201d cured before it got big enough to be seen on imaging .\nIf I had a tumor that was big enough to see on imaging , however , I \u2019 d want a surgeon to take it out .\nI \u2019 d still use VDTP/GCMAF ( if it were available ) , just in case the surgeon didn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nagalase testing is not yet available , using it to find cancer early remains a purely theoretical notion .\nMeanwhile , AMAS testing can be used to detect early cancers and to track cancer therapy .\n\u201c How can I treat it I can \u2019 t see it ?\n\u201d Some physicians find it disturbing to be treating an \u201c invisible \u201d disease that has no symptoms , no physical signs , and even eludes state-of-the-art imaging .\nThese old-schoolers remain hesitant to treat if they can not make a formal diagnosis using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , this is an outmoded , vanishing breed that in the age of molecular and genetic medicine is headed for extinction .\nUsing state-of-the-art biochemical markers , the molecular medicine early warning system enables earlier diagoses .\nDetected in its infancy , a developing disease can usually be reversed using non-toxic nutritional medicines ( diet , phytonutrients , herbs .\nvitamins , minerals , amino acids , essential fatty acids , hormones , enzymes , and homeopathic medicines ) .\nOnce the disease has progressed to a heart attack or large tumor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult , natural medicines are less often an option , and the need to resort to strong drugs looms large .\nSo here \u2019 s my unsolicited advice to those doctors who would resist identifying and treating the earliest manifestations of disease : study molecular biology and natural healing methods .\nGood things will happen !\nHype and misinformation about VDTP/GCMAF .\nIneffective and potentially toxic products .\nPure , real VDTP/GCMAF vs. phonies .\nTypes of VDTP/GCMAF knockoffs .\nAbout purity .\nVDTP/GCMAF production .\nContamination .\nCertification .\nCaveat emptor !\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nagalase testing as viable methods for treating and preventing cancer will inevitably be accompanied by genuine concern and debate about how best to put these valuable tools to work .\nParalleling these positive efforts to prevent suffering and save lives , negative forces will exude from the swamp of diabolical human greed .\nSlick hucksters will offer stuff called \u201c GCMAF \u201d that doesn \u2019 t work\u2014and may even be harmful .\nIneffective imitations and counterfeit products will appear , including knockoffs , copycats , phonies , bootlegs , and wannabes .\nThere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to convince you this is all a big hoax .\nAnd , as we all know , the internet is rife with hype and misinformation ; VDTP/GCMAF/Nagalase will be no exception .\nWhat \u2019 s a person desperately in need of cancer or HIV treatment to do ?\nThe urge to buy into false hope may be difficult or impossible to overcome .\nBecause it is identical to that which the body makes ( i.e.\n, bioidentical ) , pure GcMAF will never cause symptoms of any kind .\nWhen symptoms appear in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is impurity , contamination , or both .\nThe phonies will come in packages that look exactly like quality-certified products .\nPackaging replication technology has advanced to the point where even brand-name manufacturers can \u2019 t tell the difference between their own products and the knockoffs without chemically testing the ingredients .\nPeople will die needlessly because they put their faith in phony GcMAF products .\nA huge market for VDTP/GCMAF will emerge as it becomes a household word .\nThe already substantial risk of impure , contaminated , and inactive products will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woodwork , hawking \u201c GcMAF \u201d that will range from inactive and harmless to toxic and dangerous .\nThere will be different types of knockoffs : Bootleg or wannabe versions : serious attempts to make GcMAF that have fallen short and are impure , contaminated , and/or potentially toxic .\nBootleg versions can be pure but \u201c dirty , \u201d containing contaminants that cause muscle aches , flu-like symptoms or fatigue .\nA bootleg could also be pure ( in the sense of clean ) , but non-bioidentical , and therefore too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be effective .\nPhony versions : packaged to look exactly like the real thing , but totally inactive .\nThe \u201c GcMAF \u201d might be powdered sugar , starch , or any ( hopefully ) harmless white powder that , like VDTP/GCMAF , disappears when put into solution with water .\nThe phony product might simply contain nothing at all : several hundred nanograms of VDTP/GCMAF in a vial , sans water , would be about the size of a small speck of dust .\nAs mentioned above , nowadays it is possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packaging process that even the authentic manufacturing company can \u2019 t tell , by examining the packaging alone , whether or not the product inside is real .\nChromatography testing is required to make that determination .\nI \u2019 ll never forget an experience I had several years ago .\nA patient told me she had been injecting human growth hormone ( hGH ) that she had been obtaining from a source in in Tijuana , via San Diego .\nShe showed me the package and it looked real enough , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : perfect box , red plastic-capped vial inside , flawless label , nothing suspicious .\nI suggested we test her blood for hGH , and when we did , there was none there !\nShe had been injecting very expensive water !\nObviously this was a perfect knockoff , and when I contacted the manufacturer ( of the real product\u2014a major brand name household word drug company ) , they told me that even they were unable to tell by the packaging alone whether or not a given product was the real thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sure it was theirs !\nPerfect packaging tells you nothing .\nA \u201c pure \u201d protein contains only molecules of a single protein , and no other molecules of any kind .\nImpurities cause compromised effectiveness , adverse reactions , and symptoms of toxicity .\nMaking \u201c pure \u201d VDTP/GCMAF is not a simple undertaking .\nSo far , the only human being to have succeeded in making pure VDTP/GCMAF is Professor Nobuto Yamamoto .\nThe process is not that complicated , however .\nDr. Yamamoto provides specific instructions in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper equipment could easily make VDTP/GCMAF .\nThe raw materials are inexpensive and a large scale manufacturing operation should make for a price tag that \u2019 s within reach of the average person .\nBoth Vigor Life and Japan offer genuine productsand are a pure active product .\nBravo is not active VDTP/GCMAF .\nBeware of this product portrayed as the real VDTP/GCMAF , it is a far cry from the real thing .\nVDTP/GCMAF can be made via recombinant DNA technology by inserting a small section of DNA into the bacterium E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bacterium to make VDTP/GCMAF .\nAn impurity can be introduced at any step in this multistage protein manufacturing process .\nFor example , once these reprogrammed bacteria are incubated and have generated the VDTP/GCMAF from their revised genetic program , the newly made VDTP/GCMAF must be separated from the E. coli and then purified .\nIf some of the E. coli ( or any of the many other chemicals generated by E. coli ) are left behind with the VDTP/GCMAF , you have a troublesome impurity .\nEndotoxins are an especially common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause flu-like symptoms .\nSolvents and surfactants can likewise be left behind in the purification process .\nImpurities don \u2019 t necessarily affect the macrophage activating power of the VDTP/GCMAF product , but they can and do cause side effects such as fatigue , weakness , malaise , and muscle and joint pain .\nThese symptoms can be so uncomfortable for the patient that it becomes impossible to tolerate the beneficial effects they would otherwise obtain from the VDTP/GCMAF .\nContamination occurs when a foreign agent gets into the VDTP/GCMAF product from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of the manufacturing process ) .\nContaminants can cause symptoms similar to those due to impurities ( fatigue , weakness , malaise , and muscle and joint pain ) .\nContaminants can be airborne , or carried into the ( otherwise sterile ) production lab environment by hapless humans\u2014on their hands , feet , or clothing .\nThey can enter via the lab \u2019 s water and air supply .\nA cough from a person with a bacterial respiratory infection could cause big problems .\nContamination via molds , viruses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biotech production facilities and requires hygiene precautions so elaborate they make surgical scrubbing look like a cakewalk .\nEntering a biotech production facility is like dressing for a walk in outer space : cap , gloves , full body gown , mask , booties .\nYou don \u2019 t need oxygen tanks , but the air you breathe must be filtered to remove dust , toxic chemicals , and pathogenic microorganisms .\nAssuming we have a pure VDTP/GCMAF product , then what about activity or potency ?\nIn the world of macrophages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which VDTP/GCMAF activates macrophages is our measure of potency .\nOnly pure , bioidentical VDTP/GCMAF will provide the level of optimum macrophage activation necessary to reverse cancers and viral infections .\nExtremely sensitive receptors on the surface of macrophages are happiest when they are stimulated by pure VDTP/GCMAF .\nRearrange even a few atoms , much less a few amino acids , and the \u201c VDTP/GCMAF \u201d will not look the same to those receptors and either they won \u2019 t recognize it at all , or their response will be halfhearted .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ product must also be tested for macrophage activating power .\nThis test literally asks the macrophages , \u201c Do you recognize this particular batch of VDTP/GCMAF ?\n\u201d And , \u201c How much does it activate you ?\n\u201d Because this involves working with live human macrophages , it is not easy .\nTo determine the macrophage activating power of pure bioidentical VDTP/GCMAF , Professor Yamamoto quantified rate of phagocytosis of cancer cells ( a 30 fold increase ) , rate of generation of superoxide radicals ( 15 fold ) , and rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt will be necessary to establish a consumer protection certification program whereby product offerings\u2014when they do become available\u2014will be subjected to rigorous testing and then certified for both purity and activity .\nQ .\nWhere can I find a

"content": "Modern research has concluded that a nutritious diet is not just what the body needs , but it is something that our brain also longs for .\nThis recent finding is conceptualising what is called \u201c nutritional psychiatry.\n\u201d Traditionally , humans have never been known to question food and nutrition when it comes to mental health , but lately , we have learned that diet is the most powerful intervention .\nIf you can shape your diet , you have immense potential to improve your mental health and decrease the risk of psychiatric disorders .\n[ 1 ] If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by 2020 , depression will rank as the second leading cause of disability after heart disease .\nThis comes after nearly 1 out of 4 Americans face some mental illness .\nThis challenge is not restricted to adults .\nAlmost half of the long-term mental disorders start when kids reach the age of 14 , and this childhood mental illness affects more than 17 million kids .\nWhere is it all coming from ?\nMerely some years ago , the idea of nutritional psychiatry got registered in the realms of health care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examined how certain supplements like omega-3 fatty acids might balance mood .\nThe experts also believe that data from research [ 3 ] proves a link between diet quality and mental disorders , visually depression , and anxiety in all age groups .\nEvidence suggests that diet is as important for mental health as it is to physical health .\nAfter all , a healthy diet is protective for your body and mind , while an unhealthy diet poses a risk of depression & anxiety .\nHere are some details looking into how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crucial for brain development You are what you eat [ 4 ] .\nWhen we eat natural food that nourishes us , it becomes the enzymes , protein-building blocks , neurotransmitters and brain tissue that transfers information and signals between various parts of the brain and body .\nIt facilitates the brain and boosts growth .\nSome nutrients and dietary patterns are known to link to changes in brain protein .\nThis helps increase networks and connections between brain cells .\nA diet rich in nutrients like omega-3 & zinc boosts levels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food brings in healthy bacteria for the gut .\nIf your gut is happy , your brain is bound to stay harmonious .\nTrillions of good bacteria have existence within your gut .\nThey feed on bad germs , keeping your immune system healthy .\nThis means a healthy gut helps taming inflammation in the body and generate brain-powering B vitamins .\nFoods with beneficial bacteria called probiotics help maintain a healthy gut environment .\nThis directly affects mood and cognition .\n[ 6 ] So this means that certain foods play a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for worsening the symptoms .\nIt is simple to understand .\nA nutritious brain diet has similar logic for heart-healthy or weight control plans .\nIf you wish to limit sugary and high-fat processed foods , you must choose plant-based foods like fresh fruits , veggies , and whole grains .\nSwitch from butter to healthy fats like olive oil or traditional seed-based oils .\nThe science behind food and mood The connection between diet and emotions comes from a close relationship between the brain and the gastrointestinal tract , often known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bacteria are responsible for producing neurotransmitters , chemical substances that constantly carry messages from the gut to the brain , which exist in your GI tract .\nConsumption of healthy food lets the \u201c good \u201d bacteria sustain , positively affecting neurotransmitter production [ 7 ] .\nJunk and packaged food causes inflammation and hampers bacteria production .\nWith neurotransmitter production in good shape , your brain receives positive messages , and your emotions reciprocate it .\nBut when the circumstances are opposite , the show goes awry , and so does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for fewer mood fluctuations , promoting an overall happier outlook and an improved ability to focus .\nStudies [ 8 ] show that healthy diets can help deal with depression and anxiety symptoms .\nAt the same time , an unhealthy diet is linked to an increased risk of dementia or stroke .\nFoods that help you stay healthy and fit If you have come so far reading and now wonder what should stay on your plate and what needs to be omitted , here is another piece of advice on what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anything containing food colourings , preservatives , and other additives can cause or worsen hyperactivity and depression [ 9 ] .\nSo , make sure you eat real food or minimally processed food .\nFresh fruits and vegetables are the best options to rely on .\nPlant-based foods are full of nutrients and fibre .\nThis helps the body absorb food sugars more slowly and enables you to avoid sugar rushes & crashes .\nTo count on fibre-rich foods , fruits , vegetables , and nutrient-filled carbs like whole grains and beans are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are packed with berries , leafy green vegetables , turmeric , and foods with Omega-3 fatty acids , including salmon and black chia seeds .\nVitamin D aids the production of serotonin , and humans get it from sunlight .\nMushrooms are a good source available all through the year .\nApart from the above-stated foods , you must include those food ingredients in your diet , high in vitamins , iron , Omega-3s , zinc , magnesium , and other essential elements .\nIncorporating good-food-for-mood habits may demand some extra effort initially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and starts enjoying it , you \u2019 ll notice there is no other better way to keep your health up .\nFind here some fantastic recipes and secret ingredients that you can relish for your taste and your immunity and health .\nThese recipes are rich in fibre which is good for your body , aids digestion and , of course , flatter your taste buds without compromising on your health .\nEating habits are one reason behind the mental distress that most youths experience .\nThe way people consume chemicals and fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present generation .\nIn some of the concepts & principles pertinent to health , Ayurveda , the age-old strategist for life and health , has defined some principles in which food and nutrition have a significant role in how a person lives and what they feel .\nAyurveda shows the path to living a life that is not only balanced but also has

cell signalling pathways in cancer development and proliferation , targeted by curcumin .\nThe substance modulates enzymes , growth factors , transcription factors , inflammatory cytokines , kinase , and proapoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other agents , can be an effective drug for cancer therapy .\nThe therapeutic impacts of curcumin have been demonstrated in multiple chronic diseases [ 3 ] like inflammation , arthritis , metabolic syndrome , liver disease , obesity , neurodegenerative diseases and , above all , in several cancers [ 4 ] .\nVarious delivery systems for curcumin have been designed using nanotechnology to improvise curcumin properties & targetability .\nFor the rational design of the nanoformulations , many factors need to be considered to enhance the potential and enhance cellular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few systems used for Cancer Therapy : Different polymers are being utilized to prepare nanoformulations for curcumin drug delivery to improve its biological activity [ 5 ] .\nBiodegradable synthetic polymers and natural polymers have become widely used in drug delivery .\nPLGA-curcumin nanoformulation is effective as curcumin at 15-fold lower concentration in inhibiting mRNAs for inflammatory cytokines and increasing anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) in the brain [ 6 ] .\nStudies [ 7,8 ] compare the anticancer activity of curcumin-loaded PLGA nanoparticles ( CUR-NPs ) and curcumin-loaded PLGA nanoparticles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CUR-NPs-APgp ) .\nThe PLGA nanospheres were capable and released ASC-J9 intracellularly , leading to growth inhibition of estrogen-dependent MCF-7 cancer cells [ 9 ] .\nNanoscale liposomes are one of the most beneficial drug delivery systems for anticancer agents .\nRecent studies prove that liposome formulations improve treatment for drug-resistant tumours & reduce toxicity .\nSeveral liposome preparations have been utilized to encapsulate curcumin .\nThe liposomal lipid bilayer , dihexyl phosphate , solubilizes curcumin .\nDespite low encapsulation efficiency , it has demonstrated twenty-fold higher cytotoxic activity than unprocessed curcumin in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hepatocellular carcinoma , A549 lung carcinoma , HT29 colorectal carcinoma , and cervical carcinoma [ 10 ] .\nHydrogels & nanogels have gained considerable attention from research communities as a promising drug delivery system , with some studies investigating the curcumin-nanogel delivery in cancer therapy .\nAmong natural polymers , chitin , chitosan , and alginate have garnered the most attention for preparing nanogels in drug delivery [ 11 ] .\nA curcumin-loaded chitin nanogel is used as a transdermal system to treat skin cancer and human skin melanoma without compromising the antitumor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials have shown promising results in curcumin drug delivery .\nSome studies investigate the physical properties & therapeutic efficacy of the curcumin-loaded , self-assembling ( MAX8 ) peptide ( \u03b2-hairpin ) hydrogel system .\nThe new system combines multiple advantages such as curcumin stabilization , enhanced delivery , and controlled drug release by changing MAX8 peptide concentration .\nEncapsulating curcumin within the hydrophobic core of \u03b2-casein micelles increased its aqueous solubility by 2500 times , making it great to include in many cancer treatment systems .\nCyclodextrins are cyclic oligosaccharides consisting of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These complexes provide several beneficial properties in drug delivery , including increased bioavailability , enhanced solubility , and improved stability .\nFew studies have used cyclodextrins in curcumin delivery to minimize degradation bioavailability and reduce nonselective toxicity [ 12 ] .\nA \u03b2-cyclodextrin\u2013curcumin self-assembling preparation showed higher uptake of curcumin by prostate cancer cells than unprocessed curcumin .\nCurcumin has yielded promising results in defeating cancer cell growth and proliferation in different types of cancer .\nClinical use of curcumin is still under investigation , both as a monotherapy and in combination with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed with other medications as chemotherapeutic or adjuvant to standard treatments in cancer disease has been reported .\nIt is worth noting that some of the most recent clinical trials on curcumin have found

"THE THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL OF PSYCHEDELICS", "content": "Plant-based psychedelics have an ancient history of medicinal use .\nSince the first report on LSD in late 1950 , psychedelics have had a brief relationship with psychology and psychiatry , used as an aid to psychotherapy for treating mental disorders and alcohol dependence .\nIn the initial understanding , psychedelic drugs exhibited promising and therapeutic results before being prohibited by the legislature in the mid-1960s .\nThe early 90s witnessed a steady revival of human psychedelic research .\nSome reports emerged as what can be said to be the modern brain imaging study [ 1 ] with LSD and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symptoms .\nLet \u2019 s dig a little more into it !\nPsychedelics of plant extraction , such as mescaline and psilocybin ( magic mushrooms ) , have been used for centuries across the globe , however Western science was not open to them until 1897 , when Arthur Heffter isolated mescaline .\nRecent controlled clinical studies [ 2 ] have been conducted to assess the basic psychopharmacological properties and therapeutic efficacy of psychedelic drugs as adjuncts to existing psychotherapeutic approaches .\n\u201c Psychedelic \u201d drugs include a range of substances with varying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on conscious experience .\nFind in this table some of the types of psychedelic drugs listed .\nThe classic psychedelics exert primary activity as agonists at the 5-HT2A receptor , e.g.\n, LSD , psilocybin , dimethyltryptamine and mescaline .\n[ 3 ] Many of these substances are found to have analogues of chemicals found in plants or fungi used traditionally for spiritual or folk healing rituals [ 4 ] .\nThe second class of psychedelic , i.e.\n, the entactogens , include methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA ) .\nThis acts as a serotonin-releasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very distinct from classic psychedelics .\n[ 5 ] Other substances classified as \u201c psychedelic \u201d , such as ketamine , scopolamine , or ibogaine , are beyond the scope of recent studies .\nThere are some mental disorders for which psychedelics are being utilized for treatments ; the studies regarding the same are underway .\nThese disorders majorly include addiction , anxiety , and PTSD .\nHere \u2019 s a deeper analysis of how it works and helps !\nIn 2014 , a controlled study in Switzerland suggested LSD and psychotherapy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with a terminal illness .\n[ 6 ] Twelve patients with life-threatening conditions agreed to participate in the study .\nThey received treatment that involved drug-free psychotherapy sessions supplemented with two LSD-assisted sessions two to three weeks apart .\nAt two months \u2019 follow-up , the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) showed non-significant reductions in trait anxiety but significant reductions in state anxiety .\nAnnual follow-up showed sustainable therapeutic benefit with no acute or chronic drug-related severe adverse effects .\nNo adverse effects lasted more than one day after an LSD-assisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed promising results as a treatment for anxiety in patients with a terminal illness .\n[ 8 ] A 2008 study on ameliorating end-of-life anxiety focused on participants with end-stage cancer .\nAfter several non-drug-assisted therapy sessions , participants underwent a crossover study where they received experimental medication ( psilocybin ) and active ( placebo niacin ) across two sessions a few weeks apart .\nPsilocybin-assisted psychotherapy lowered anxiety & improved mood without any adverse effects .\nMDMA-assisted therapy is being studied as a treatment for social anxiety in autism patients .\nPreviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therapy to treat addictions .\nThis included alcohol dependence , and the study found beneficial effects .\nIn renewed clinical research on treating alcohol dependence with psilocybin-assisted treatment , a study reported showing reduced drinking habits by more than half .\nOther recent research on psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for addiction includes a pilot study of treatment for tobacco dependence which found it to have a positive impact .\nThe same research team is currently designing a follow-up randomized controlled study to compare a similar psilocybin intervention with nicotine-replacement therapy .\nControlled studies have investigated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to PTSD .\nInitial results [ 9 ] improved upon the best available pharmacotherapies and psychotherapies .\nNo serious adverse effects were reported .\nThe outcomes included sustainable & significant reduction in PTSD symptoms as measured by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale ( CAPS ) , with 83 % of participants showing a decrease in symptom severity of more than 30 % .\nPsychedelics are promising substances to treat depression , anxiety , and substance-related disorders .\nThe available studies suggest incorporating these drugs in health systems worldwide in the coming years .\nComplex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dialogue is needed between scientists , policymakers , community agents , healthcare professionals , spiritual leaders , and ethnobotanical ceremony providers .\nSince incorporating psychedelics in medical and social levels is beneficial , a progressive and regulated approach is what society needs today !\nWith studies proving psychedelics to be beneficial for Alzheimer \u2019 s and Dementia patients , researchers hope to relieve patients looking for a reprieve from these diseases .\nHuman history is full of evidence of how nature has been the best

system and its particular effect on patients suffering from a compromised immune system .\nIt was here that Anna discovered that the prevention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s immune system , which in turn requires boosting their Vitamin D levels back up to the higher end of the recommended scale .\nWith over two decades of research Anna has also focused her attention on cancer immunotherapy and a lesser-known molecule called Vitamin D Transport Protein ( VDTP ) , or Globulin component Macrophage Activating Factor ( GcMaf ) This is the focus of this book .\nAnna puts her heart , soul , knowledge and skills into making a difference for people living with acute and chronic disease .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to research and further push the boundaries of immunotherapy , she blends the best of her talents to drive forward the development and innovation of immunology within current clinical conditions .\nShe is hopeful for the future of Immunotherapy , as many of her discoveries break new ground in the field of disease prevention and in turn improving and reversing the ever-declining health of humanity .\nAnna gives special thanks to her beloved friend and knowledgeable colleague , Maryjane Aria for the unwavering dedication , support , knowledge and research that she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years .\nWithout her , this book would not have been possible .\nSince its discovery in the early 1980 \u2019 s , the role that Vitamin D Transport Protein ( VDTP ) , or Globulin component Macrophage Activating Factor ( GcMaf ) plays in the immune system is becoming more understood .\nSince that discovery , unfortunately the research has been stalled , suppressed and in some cases unjustly discredited by powerful voices in both the media and the scientific community .\nThis has not happened by accident , nor because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt can no longer be denied that GcMaf ( VDTP ) has a very real place in both the body and within scientific and medical research worldwide .\nFor those working in this field it is the worst kept secret of all time .\nImmuno-therapies have been developing at an alarming pace with billions of dollars being poured into the laboratories looking for new and novel ways to combat disease .\nOf course , the billions spent on this research do not come without the desire for results and a return on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment leading to profit via patents and mandatory uptake of the products is the millstone around the necks of those wishing to produce a cure for disease instead of developing a product that merely performs as an \u2018 ill-health \u2019 management option .\nWhat should be alarming about this , within this industry , is the word \u2018 patent \u2019 .\nIt is impossible to patent something that is naturally occurring in nature .\nEvery single chemical in the medical and pharmaceutical industry that has been synthesized in a laboratory has at some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expires , then generic drugs and products can be marketed at a vastly reduced price , but not before the medical manufacturers , the original patent holders , have made enormous profits .\nGcMaf ( VDTP ) is a naturally occurring substance that every

if you donate blood , you are freely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every single human being , it comes completely without risk of harm or side effects .\nSo why has it been so suppressed for so long ?\nThe simple answer is \u2018 because it works effectively \u2019 .\nGcMaf ( VDTP ) is not the magic bullet for all illnesses .\nNeither should it be treated as such .\nIf you drink too much alcohol it will not cure your hangover or repair your liver .\nIf you smoke it will not fix the hardening of your arteries .\nIt will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lose weight or cure cataracts .\nIt is however vital to your ability to defend yourself from infections and must always be considered as a key body systemic component that a healthy lifestyle supports .\nThis book seeks to explain the biochemical interactions and how it functions within the body and how it is vital to good health .\nIf you continue your investigations into the subject of GcMaf ( VDTP ) and why it is so difficult to find either the genuine product or reliable reviews of it , you \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why none of the multinational pharmaceutical corporations are promoting it .\nThis booklet has been prepared to highlight and provide information on two exceptional proteins involved in the fight against cancer and infectious disease .\nGcMaf has the potential to all prevent medical conditions that will attack our immune system .\nThese two naturally occurring , bio-identical protein molecules ( made by our own bodies using our own genes ) have the potential to be used in the treatment of cancer and all infectious disease .\nThe precursor to GcMaf is part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood .\nIt is part of the natural albumin family of proteins .\nThe precursor to GcMaf is the albumin family protein GcGlobulin .\nIt is also known as Vitamin D Binding Protein , or Vitamin D Transport Protein .\nGcMaf is maintained as a precursor to be converted when required .\nIf it were present as the converted type , then all macrophages would be activated all the time , which the body does not want as it requires energy and a balance for wound healing and cell communication .\nThe precursor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protein ( VDTP ) or Gc-Globulin .\nIt acts as a transport binding protein for Vitamin D. It can bind actin , a breakdown product from muscles and tissues which need clearing and recycling .\nThe protein can also bind oleic acid .\nThis is also why Vitamin D is so important for the immune system , as the higher levels of stored Vitamin D you have the more you will have readily available for your GcMaf to bind and stabilize to .\nNagalase is an enzyme generated by the body which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt is also produced by cancer cells and most viruses .\nIn this book we will cover additional information regarding how these proteins are generated in the body .\nResearch data on GcMaf has been accumulating since the initial work of Prof. Nobuto Yamamoto .\nMany research groups ( Inui et al , Saburi et al , Maryjayne Aria and myself ) are now unlocking the capability of this protein and its ability to activate macrophages for combating cancer and infectious disease .\nIn conjunction with the increase in research of GcMaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N-Acetylgalactosaminidase ) has also increased .\nThis GcMaf protein present in the body is employed to promote healing from the invasion of external infectious agents .\nUltimately it is hoped that GcMaf and Nagalase can be used to : \u2022 Identify the presence of cancer and to aid in its clearance from the body \u2022 Detect and reverse early cancers long before imaging can identify them \u2022 Determine whether a cancer treatment program is working or not Nagalase screening , coupled with early treatment using GcMaf ( VDTP ) , has the potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therapy for everyone .\nYou may consider this a bold statement ; however , the data being generated through active research ( as highlighted in this handbook ) , can provide the facts and reveal the science behind GcMaf ( VDTP ) , Nagalase , and the molecular biology of macrophage activation that will demonstrate this statement to be true .\nThese are real and large advancements in cancer therapy .\nThis booklet has three major objectives \u2022 To further the cause of making GcMaf available to all who need it \u2022 To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer therapies \u2022 To promote the establishment of Nagalase as a potential cancer screening marker for all high-risk patients With Nagalase testing the technology is available to identify cancer when it is just a handful of cells which can then be easily reversed with a 3-month course of GcMaf injections .\nThese possibilities will drive the capability for early-stage detection and the effective treatment in overcoming cancer .\nGcMaf ( VDTP ) and Nagalase are both proteins .\nA brief mention of protein synthesis is required .\nProteins are composed of building blocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amino acids that are available to be used to make proteins .\nSome are classed as essential .\nThere are nine amino acids that we are unable to generate and so can only acquire from food .\nThe others can be generated from the vast array of biochemical pathways that occur in every cell .\nThere is a continuous breakdown of excess proteins and amino acids , to individual elements , that are then reconverted and used to generate new amino acids and new proteins .\nAmino acids can undergo different reactions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or proteins .\nThe sequence of the amino acids in the chains is directed by our genes in our DNA sequence .\nThis is the so-called genetic code .\nThe genes can hold the information for over 10 million proteins ; all this with 4 DNA nucleotides and 20 amino acids !\nThe amino acids sequence is a linear item .\nTo preserve space and provide extra binding areas , receptor areas , and different slight changes in charge , the sequence folds in on itself .\nSome proteins combine with others in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subunits that are required for its function .\nThe basic concept is depicted below Proteins are therefore long chains of hundreds of amino acids that make up the \u201c protein molecule \u201d .\nThe protein molecule may look like an indistinct ball of haphazardly placed clumps .\nHowever , for a protein the folding and combination of any other subunits is a specific formation of the three-dimensional structure .\nThe final structure is a very precisely positioned set of amino acids .\nEven a slight positional change , or a missing amino acid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significantly alter the structure of the protein .\nIt will even alter its activity , positional , or messenger function .\nIt may even block a receptor site .\nIn other words , it would be disastrous .\nThe amino acids can attach to sugars on the outside of the protein complex .\nThese sugars provide the messenger , communicating , or function activity of proteins .\nThese proteins are termed glycoproteins , whilst most of the immune system \u2019 s \u201c messenger molecules \u201d are Homologous proteins .\nVitamin D-binding protein ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which our immune cells make GcMaf .\nDTP contains 458 amino acids , one of which is incredibly special and quite different from all the others .\nThis is a threonine amino acid , the 420th amino acid in its chain .\nAttached to this threonine is a group of three sugars .\nThe presence of these sugars defines the purpose of the entire VDTP protein molecule .\nNow imagine ( VDTP ) as this large 3D complexed protein with three sugars attached .\nThe first sugar is an \u03b1-N-acetylgalactosamine ( GalNac ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe second is a sialic acid ( SA , also known as N-acetylneuraminic acid ) sugar molecule and the third is a \u03b2-galactose ( Gal ) sugar .\nAll three are attached to one another , as shown in the diagram below , in an upside-down \u201c Y \u201d -shaped configuration .\nThe lines ( \u2013 ) indicate the bonds formed by sugars which connect themselves to each other and to the protein .\nThe amino acid threonine at position 420 is on the surface of the 3D complex of VDTP making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells on initial contact .\nVDTP is converted into GcMaf by using two reactions .\nTreatment with the \u03b2-galactosidase enzyme which is embedded in the outer cell membrane of B-lymphocytes , and present in the lysosomal vesicles of most cells .\nThe second reaction is to remove the Sialic acid sugar .\nThis is performed by the enzyme Sialidase , which is in the outer membrane of T-lymphocyte cells and present in the lysosomes of most cells .\nWith the cleavage of these two sugars , the Vitamin D-Binding Protein has been converted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ready to seek out a macrophage where it will lock onto its receptor and then send the powerful activation message .\nThis is where the macrophage now alters its type from M2 to M1 .\nFrom , the wound healing and regulatory type , to the surveillance and invader seeking phagocytotic role .\nGcMaf is the most potent of macrophage stimulatory molecules that we know .\nThe initial research leads to a great understanding for the basic science of GcMaf ( VDTP ) which has been confirmed by the additional studies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one study become the driving force for designing the next one .\nYamamoto spent a quarter of a century examining the basic molecular biology and immunology of the action of cancer and GcMaf ( VDTP ) .\nThe work on Nagalase ( \u03b1-N-acetylgalactosaminidase ) and glycoprotein macrophage activating factor ( GcMaf ) was methodical , progressive , and fascinatingly revealing .\nThe work involved an intricate set of hypothesis and path of experimental results that together formed a vast infrastructure of data on the cancer formation and treatment sides , upon which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not try out a new , unknown , and potentially toxic drug on a bunch of people .\nYamamoto completed the science and research ; exactly , precisely , down to the sub-molecular level , how cancer breaks our bodies , then resolved how to reverse it using the body \u2019 s own systems as the overriding therapeutic tool .\nThe research results deserve to have these findings dispersed to be understood and taken with credibility , which as yet has not yet occurred .\nThe idea of being diagnosed with Cancer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most fear .\nIt is many things to many people ?\nFrom the point of view of the cancer patient , it may be seen as a fear-inducing , death sentence .\nFrom the perspective of a family member cancer is a stressful period of mourning , that requires constant support , negotiating the ever-changing emotional , financial and physical changes that occur from diagnosis and lasting for an undefined period of time , with the ending often being the loss of a loved one .\nFor the doctor who must locate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ability ; cancer is both a laborious , sometimes unrewarding task , as well as an opportunity to provide exceptional , loving patient care .\nThe molecular biologist , however , views cancer as a vicious and protracted conflict directed between cancer cells and the immune supporting cells , it is a Nano-scale on-going battle that is happening in each of us , every moment of every day .\nWe now know that we are all developing potential cancer cells all the time through the mismatched mutations that occur during our normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microorganisms and viruses .\nHowever , a healthy immune system overcomes them as fast as they are made .\nAnything that weakens the immune system can shift that delicate balance in favour of cancer , allowing it to gain a foothold and grow .\nCancer Research and prevention has had enormous resources applied to it over the years , with early detection and effective treatments beyond the classical , surgery , radiotherapy and chemotherapy needed to assist in the fight against this deadly disease .\nThe rise of the interest in immunotherapy has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herceptin ( Trastuzumab for breast cancer ) , Erbitux ( Cetuximab for bowel cancer ) being increasingly used for treatments .\nA cancer occurs when a cell \u2019 s genes mutate and is expressed or affects the expression of other essential control genes .\nCells in the body are continuously replacing themselves by a process of mitosis : \u2013 or cell division .\nMitosis generates a direct copy of the original cell if all the procedures and processes and cell requirements are present .\nDuring the cell division process there is the possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become mutated by various mismatches , or incomplete copying processes .\nSometimes extra DNA can be inserted , or removed due to viral , bacterial , or fungal infections .\nThis process can generate cells containing damaged genes .\nThere are approximately 30 trillion cells in the body which can go through mitosis every single .\nA mutation rate of 6 mutations per 2 million mitotic divisions has been estimated .\nThis would provide potentially 3 million mutations daily that is corrected by the body automatically in a normal healthy human .\nIf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as medications , cleaning agents , bacterial , fungal , or viral infections then the rate may be higher !\nThis provides many opportunities for potential cancerous mutations to occur .\nCancerous cells are therefore made up of cells that carry damaged genes .\nNormal healthy cells have a special contact segregation mechanism to stop them getting too big or absorbing any other cells they touch .\nCancerous cells have lost the ability to cooperate with the rest of the cellular community and so grow uninhibited , randomly and out of control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an isolated local community made up of malignant tumor cells .\nTumors grow where they form and are able to grow new blood vessels .\nCancer cells need a lot of energy and more nutrients for their fast growth .\nAs we know processed sugar is a major contributor to cancer growth , so stopping sugar intake will help slow this growth .\nSome tumor cells send out signals that tell the body to produce new blood vessels at the tumor site which proved not only a food and oxygen supply , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new part of the body , through these new blood vessels and into bloodstream .\nCells that break away from the tumor begin to spread to surrounding tissues ( via the bloodstream or lymphatic system ) where they can start new tumors This is called metastasis when these escaping tumor cells go on to establish satellite communities at other locations in other organs .\nThe life of any cancer can be viewed as a continuous continuum : \u2013 starting with one cell ( on the far left side ) and expanding in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and progression to metastasis and ending ( to the far right side ) as a unmolested massive complex of metastatic tumors comprised of many billions of cells , wide ranging self-generated intertwined blood vessels which occupying multiple locations in the body .\nThis progression of the cancer life cycle ends with a cancer which had become large enough , to overwhelm and ultimately , kill its host .\nCancer specialists evaluate what \u201c stage \u201d the cancer is according to where the tumor complexity lies on this continuum .\nSo , it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create a cancer cell .\nThis cell multiplies by dividing to become an expanding tumor mass .\nJust like termites in your house , cancers persistently gnaw away , expanding and encroaching .\nThey capture territory by spreading locally and pushing aside healthy tissues .\nEventually they break through the barriers that keep them local spilling out and spreading around the body .\nIf a tumor remains unchecked , the cancer cells seek to enter the bloodstream or lymphatic system and it at this stage that the body \u2019 s cancer containment barriers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage has been achieved the dangerous cancer has become the insidious , untreatable , most feared , and most deadly form of metastatic cancer .\nPrior to metastasis , almost all cancers can be considered treatable .\nAfter metastasis , the odds of a successful treatment fall dramatically to almost zero .\nTreatment at this metastatic stage by the oncologists continues to be chemotherapy , or any accepted and potentially new drugs that are in clinical trials , as well as the usual radiology , using sophisticated blasts and ionizing particle beams .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts are for the most part futile : metastatic cancer may be slowed but is rarely successfully treated .\nHowever , these treatments and methods used in the standard therapies do reduce tumor burden which improves the odds that GcMaf ( VDTP ) will be effective .\nNormal cells stop replicating after they have doubled 50 or 60 times .\nCancer cells do not stop reproducing and can be considered to have a type of \u201c immortality \u201d .\nA cancer cell will continue doubling until a tumor is formed that is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original cancerous \u2022 Cancer cells override normal cell signaling .\nThis may be because the genes that coordinate the cell to stop reproducing on contact have been blocked .\nSo , the cancer cell keeps on replicating , irrespective of the damage the tumor causes .\n\u2022 Cancer cells can become detached , explaining how cancer cells spread ( metastasis ) to other parts of the body .\n\u2022 Cancer cells stay immature and undifferentiated becoming increasingly primitive , with a tendency to reproduce ever more rapidly and haphazardly .\nCurrent Treatment Options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2022 Optimum treatment strategies vary depending on the type and stage of the cancer .\nIn the earliest stage , prior to detection on imaging ( but positive on AMAS or Nagalase ) , \u2018 alternative \u2019 treatment approaches are likely to ultimately work .\nThis is true because natural therapies enhance the body \u2019 s own anti-cancer systems , rather than damaging them .\nOnce a cancer has grown to the size where it can be seen on imaging , however , the \u201c toxic triad \u201d ( surgery , radiation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The effectiveness of any therapy , including GcMaf , has everything to do with the point along the life cycle when treatment is initiated .\nEarly detection has justifiably become a crucial aspect in cancer therapy .\nThe earlier a cancer is detected , almost regardless of type , the better the overall prognosis .\nCatching a cancer before it metastasizes is especially important .\nThe desire is to move the point of detection as far to the beginning of the tumor life cycle as possible .\nThe use of AMAS and Nagalase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used appropriately helps monitor the progress of treatments .\nThe body is a fabulous organism that has evolved over millennia to become the life-form we are now .\nPart of the old innate immune system is still present and provides the very basic and fundamental control mechanisms that prolongs life .\nPart of this old immune system is the curious , yet essential cell , the macrophage .\nFirst discovered in 1884 by the Russian zoologist \u00c9lie Metchnikoff .\nThe macrophage is a specialist white blood cell that has unique properties .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood system as it \u2019 s very own road map .\nIt also has specific associations with individual tissues and organs where their name changes , such as those in the central nervous system ( Microglia ) , bone ( Osteoclasts ) , liver ( Kupffer cells ) , kidneys ( Intraglomerular mesangial cells ) etc .\nMacrophages are big white blood cells ( three times larger than normal cells , see later ! )\nthat can chase , capture , engulf , and digest invading foreign bodies .\nThis activity known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macro meaning Big , and \u2018 phage \u2019 meaning eater .\nIt is a big eater cell !\nThey engulf dying cells , any general debris , any foreign invading cells , or anything that is different to the type of proteins specific to the body \u2019 s healthy cells , which they collect and then dispose of .\nOnce a foreign body is detected it is immobilized using a \u201c sticky \u201d protein called Opsonin .\nThe microbe , or cancer cell is \u2018 phagocytosed \u2019 meaning it is encapsulated inside a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as a \u201c phagolysosome , \u201d where it is then destroyed using an electron-driven free radical oxidative burst .\nThe macrophage cells have a wide range of complex abilities such as being able to secrete cell messenger cytokines and take part in other cell interactions , which are covered further below .\n\u2022 Macrophage activity can be simplified and split into two major functional modes termed : \u2022 At this stage they provide the active host-defense against pathogens using phagocytosis with the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokinesand micro-biocidal compounds .\nIn this form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities such as healing and repairing damage to tissues and wounds .\nMacrophages default to the M2 state , whilst the need for the active defense and inflammatory stage is triggered when needed .\nThis controls the cell \u2019 s activities , reducing the overall energy burden .\nThe most potent activation from M2 to an M1 state is performed by GcMaf .\nThe enzymes necessary are held in small vesicles in cells which are released on the damage to cells caused by bacterial , viral , or physical contamination .\nThis as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be activated to M1 type , defending the contamination , and immediately helping with the healing process .\nThe way it does this will be discussed later in the booklet .\nMacrophages are large cells and are huge in comparison with red blood cells , normal white blood cells and any typical single cancer cell , which is around 7 microns ( micrometres , or millionths of a meter ) in diameter and have a volume of about 250 cubic microns .\nA macrophage cell in comparison is approximately 20 micrometres ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diameter , being about three times as wide as regular cells .\nHowever , because of the relationship between size and volume macrophages have a volume of around 4000 cubic microns , about 16 times the volume of normal sized cells .\nIf a cancer cell were the size of a dog , a macrophage would be about the size of an elephant !\nComprising various weaponry , they are packed full of a formidable array of sophisticated systems , all of which are programmed for a singular purpose : remove the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a term known as \u201c tumoricidal capacity.\n\u201d In the M2 mode , they are focused on wound healing and cell regulation , moving in the bloodstream and between cells in a casual movement , keeping everything in check and ensuring things are working correctly .\nWhen activated they generate small appendages termed \u201c pseudopodia \u201d ( false legs ) which extend and effectively touch anything around them , checking that it is a \u201c normal \u201d acceptable part of the body .\nActivation occurs when they meet with an invading bacterium , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once activated they can effectively \u201c walk \u201d through tissues using these self-generated \u201c legs \u201d .\nThey ramble around searching for cells or intruders that are \u201c not self \u201d or foreign .\nIf the \u201c enemy \u201d is further away , or is trying to elude capture , the macrophage chases after it , extruding a cluster of these long thin sticky spaghetti-like tentacles that they wrap around the foreign body , in an unbreakable stranglehold .\nThese pseudopodia legs secrete a \u201c sticky \u201d opsonin protein that confines the foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells cytoplasm , secreting a cocktail of corrosive free radicals and enzymes that rapidly digest its victim down into its original component parts ( amino acids , nucleic acids , fatty acids , etc. )\n.\nThe macrophage then spits out these pieces into the intercellular soup where the body quickly recycles them using these \u201c spare parts \u201d to build brand new healthy cells .\nThe macrophage can also take the foreign body , or parts of it , to the liver if required where the acquired ( learned ) immune system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to fight off the disease of attack by the virus , bacteria , or cancer .\nIt is a totally astonishing concept that this complex and truly combative scenario is a constant process , unfolding in every healthy person , every minute of every day .\nThis cancer conflict could be considered a direct war on the body .\nIt is in effect a complex tactical sequence of cellular activities .\nA series of deliberate actions , from all cellular types , highlights the range and sophistication of the attack and defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells and macrophages ) comprise the main forces of the opposing combatants in our immune system .\nBoth have massive numbers of personnel and weaponry at their disposal and both have a strategy for success .\nFor this is a war inside of us , the outcome of which will eventually determine whether about a third of us will live or die .\nHundreds of billions of cellular \u201c warriors \u201d fight for dominance over each other , whilst our lives depend on the outcome .\nA cellular battle to the death .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to survive and spread , on the other hand our immune system consists of enormous numbers of clever and cunning white blood cells doing their best to defend us against constant attack .\nGcMaf treatment and Nagalase testing have the potential to dramatically change the outcome of the battle and ensure a continued advantage towards the immune system .\nA change in the approach of cancer treatment needs to occur .\nIt has to occur in tandem with changes in the medical industry to give a real visible possibility of hope that cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis has a vast effect on medical care delivery systems , including governments , Pharmaceutical giants , insurance companies , cancer care facilities and cancer specialists .\nFor a multiplicity of reasons , not limited to money alone , these colossal barriers are resistant to change .\nGcMaf and Nagalase are the two new elements that can make for vast and positive change if the medical industry were to accept them as part of cancer treatment .\nEnsuring that these new yet ancient elements are accepted into cancer treatment options and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a monumental challenge .\nSadly though , people will continue to die because of the reluctance of modern medicine to embrace any kind of change , or new approach .\nThat said , if the screening of everyone for elevated Nagalase started today , alongside the administration of GcMaf to those with high results , then the possibility of eradicating almost all cancers could happen .\nLiterally overnight .\nThe Body \u2019 s Immune Response to Cancer and Microbes The guardians of our immune defense are composed of dozens of cell types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ macrophage cells are the body \u2019 s immune systems great defenders against the invading foreign bodies , such as cancer and infectious bacteria and viruses .\nOnce the foreign invaders have entered the body , they try to establish a foothold and multiply manipulating the body \u2019 s system to their own advantage .\nOur immune system deploys these remarkable weapons in multiple wars on several fronts .\nIt was highlighted previously that macrophages are found throughout the body and are usually associated with specific organs .\nOur major organs are the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Within our skin , respiratory system , intestinal tract and bloodstream is where we sustain the largest exposure to external attack from foreign invading cells .\nAnd so it is here that we house the majority of our immune cells .\nMicrobes in the form of bacteria , fungi , parasites and viruses , are ever present in the air we breathe , the food we ingest and on our skin .\nThey tirelessly attack and try to invade us every waking minute and must be defeated on a continuous basis .\nWhilst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in our gastrointestinal tract , otherwise known as our gut , which is our largest and most frequently breached barrier .\nApproximately 80 % of our white-blood cells are embedded just beneath the intestinal mucosal surface .\nThis is the reason the food we eat determines so much when it comes to our health .\nEating processed GMO foods that are low in nutrition and high in additives is not only depleting the body of vital nutrients but is also a direct attack on our immune system and so the food you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ongoing battle .\nOur immune cells deploy a fantastic and unimaginable array of war machinery , all coordinated by a sophisticated communications system .\nThe active immune cells are capable of releasing an onslaught of chemical messages consisting of secreted proteins , glycoproteins , cytokines , inter cell-signaling molecules , neurotransmitters , etc .\nAll of which help identify the foreign invaders , provide their location , estimate their numbers and coordinate the attack .\nThis immune response functions well when allowed , but there is a problem with the immune response when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Nagalase ( \u03b1-N-acetylgalactosaminidase ) .\nNagalase is expressed and generated by all cancer cells and viruses particularly the viruses that have an external envelope such as HIV , Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C , Influenza , Herpes simplex , Epstein-Barr virus , and others .\nIn relatively simple terms Nagalase is an enzyme that removes a sugar from other proteins in a biochemical reaction , usually to provide the sugar N-acetylgalactosamine for additional biochemical reactions in the body .\nNagalase can be a bit non-specific in its actions and can act as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there are other sugars attached to it .\nWhat makes this specific capability of Nagalase important ?\nNagalase provides a method by which cancer cells and viruses can decrease the initial immune system of our bodies to enhance their foothold during early-stage infections .\nIt allows the cancer cells to remain \u201c undetected \u201d until they reach a critical mass and move down the cancer life cycle to the untreatable metastasis stage .\nNagalase can block the formation blocks of normal natural GcMaf from the precursor VDTP ( Vitamin D Transport Protein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce and secrete Nagalase on a continual basis , so as you approach a cancer cell , or tumor , the concentration of Nagalase naturally increases , so , at the point where activated M1 macrophages are needed most , the cancer cells have a mechanism to decrease their activation completely and prevent their detection .\nThe Following diagram ( also presented earlier ) shows how GcMaf is made , as well as the The presence of Nagalase prevents normal natural GcMaf ( VDTP ) from being formed .\nPlease also note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have all three sugars attached .\nWhich means that it reverts to being a simple carrier protein , losing its capability to act as a messenger , or stimulatory protein .\nOf course , the closer a molecule of the precursor protein VDTP gets to a cancer tumor , the Nagalase concentration increases meaning that VDTP can not be converted to GcMaf ( VDTP ) This is a truly clever and effective tool to stop the body from defending itself .\nBy blocking the normal natural GcMaf ( VDTP ) production , Nagalase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response , thus allowing cancer and infections to spread .\nand grow without restriction .\nHere macrophages remain in the \u201c deactivated \u201d M2 phase , leaving cancer to grow and take over , which alas will eventually kill the patient .\nNagalase is remarkably efficient , it is an enzyme .\nThis means it is an effective catalyst able to remove the sugars from not just one DTP precursor but as many as it can come across .\nOne Nagalase molecule can thus destroy a huge quantity of DTP precursor molecules .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ GcMaf has to be provided to reach a concentration higher than the Nagalase at the tumor sites .\nAs well as circulate throughout the bloodstream to stimulate additional macrophages to become the activated M2 type .\nAs already mentioned , GcMaf is a cell-signaling glycoprotein specific for macrophages .\nIt stimulates macrophages to rapidly locate , attack and destroy cancer cells .\nBy activating macrophages , GcMaf triggers a cascade that activates the entire immune system .\nAs we have already determined viruses also make Nagalase and so the outcome is the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is essential the macrophages be incapacitated , and the macrophages be activated into attack .\nHowever , Nagalase has a very positive outcome with a secondary role that can be exploited by the medical profession , as it can be measured and therefore direct concentrations due to cancer , or tumor size can be indicated .\nIt can become a sensitive marker for all cancers and viruses , meaning it could be a reliable system for early detection of tumors , or viral infections .\nIt can also be used to monitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Falling Nagalase levels would tend to indicate cancer remission , or viral decrease .\nAnd so Nagalase , that is so effective at hiding cancers and viruses from detection within the body , has become a highly effective detection tool for us when it comes to detecting the very presence of disease and monitoring treatment protocols .\nWhen GcMaf is Administered and Activates Macrophages Once GcMaf ( VDTP ) presents its protruding last few amino acids , you should recall that the single sugar \u03b1-N-acetylgalactosamine is present .\nThis portion of the protein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a messenger molecule seeking the relevant receptor on the macrophage cell .\nOnce the GcMaf ( VDTP ) protein complex attaches in position , this protruding part naturally fits into a cleft in the macrophage cell , causing a message to be conveyed that changes the biochemical profile inside the macrophage from its more sedate M2 type , to its surveillance , marauding , phagocytotic M1 type .\nWhen GcMaf is injected at a level of 100ng a week , it does not sound much , so how can such a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response highlights the control the body has on life .\nIt shows that normal levels of GcMaf ( VDTP ) must be much lower than this .\nWhy ?\nWell because the body needs something effective to create the response to fight off any disease .\nIf the body required more grams of protein to be effective then that would take time , resources and energy to produce macrophage activation and the body risks becoming overrun .\nSo it has developed a system where only a relatively small amount of activating agents is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place where a foreign invader ( bacteria , virus , and fungi ) has entered the body , ie : where it is immediately needed .\nMacrophages are activated at that point and rapidly seek out the invader .\nOnce activated , Macrophages have a positive feedback system of chemical messengers .\nMacrophages and other immune defense cells such as lymphocytes release these messenger molecules ( cytokines , interferons , leukotrienes , and other small molecules ) into the bloodstream , which takes over the immediate GcMaf ( VDTP ) activation message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAll this happens almost instantaneously .\nEverything is extremely well-organized and perfectly coordinated .\nThe invader is identified , and that message is sent to all macrophages .\nAn inflammatory response is then started to protect and engulf the invader .\nMacrophages can also multiply rapidly .\nWhen they find an area of high cancer cell or viral particle density , there isn \u2019 t time to wait for the reinforcing activated macrophages seeking out where the problem is and so they cleverly clone themselves on short notice .\nThis multiplication process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole event snowballs creating far improved chances for the immune system \u2019 s ability to regain the upper hand .\nIt only requires 1 molecule of GcMaf ( VDTP ) to activate 1 macrophage , again highlighting how effective the Nagalase from cancer cells is at blocking it .\nA single dose of 100ng of GcMaf provides almost 300 molecules for each current circulating macrophage .\nThus , highlighting how such a small dose is so effective , as the chance meeting of GcMaf ( VDTP ) by each macrophage is increased .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ an almost immediate response .\nThe macrophage is stimulated to become the activated invader seeking and destroying defense cells of the body \u2019 s innate immune system

for easier visualization in a laboratory culture .\nPlease note the pseudopodia that are projecting from the macrophage that is typical of the activated M1 macrophage type .\nOur macrophage cells can

selection of enzymes and chemical messengers that break down the cancer cell wall , reducing its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cell contents spill out , and the cancer cell goes through a process of apoptosis .\nMacrophages surround the cancer cells and effectively digest it enabling the contents to be mopped up and recycled .\nThese combative aspects are visualized in the pictures above .\nThe activated macrophages \u201c eat \u201d into the cancer cells ( breast carcinoma in this case ) as seen by the \u201c halo \u201d around them .\nThe cancer cell walls are broken down and their cell structure falls apart .\nOf course , macrophages use phagocytosis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or foreign body attack .\nOnce macrophages have phagocytosed and destroyed the cancer cell , or foreign invader ( bacteria or virus ) they transport some of the cellular breakdown parts to start the learnt immune system .\nThe first line of defense is the innate immune system .\nThe next line of defense is the sophisticated antibody protection system that is the \u201c learnt \u201d immune system .\nMacrophages can become antigen presenting cells once they phagocytose the cancer cells or invading foreign bodies .\nMacrophages therefore have an important role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phagocytosed infectious organisms , or cancer cell debris .\nMacrophages can express high levels of interferon-gamma stimulating T-Cell activation .\nThis boosts the antigen presentation by macrophages resulting in the increased activation of T cells to generate antibodies .\nMacrophages also disperse chemical signals ( chemokines , cytokines etc . )\nto increase the number of white blood cells ( termed neutrophils and monocytes ) which release a range of toxic agents designed to kill extracellular pathogens .\nThe release of the chemical messengers increases the self-stimulation as well as recruiting and transferring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immune cells , for the destruction of the foreign cells or invading organisms .\nThis cellular set of messages and the stimulation of the other immune cells results in a well-informed set of immune cells that know exactly what \u201c foreign \u201d cell or invading microorganism they are looking for .\nThese cells spread the message and the immune system becomes the formidable sentinels of the body .\nThe chemical messages now provide a complete method for the immune system to recognize the cancer cells which when they locate them aim to engulf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innate immune surveillance system has been fully activated .\nWe then wonder why cancer cells can progress to the stage of tumors if the immune cells are so good at protecting the body .\nAnd again , this is due to the protein that cancer cells and viruses express \u2013 namely Nagalase .\nSo as we have covered cancer cells tumors and viral infections secrete the enzyme that prevents GcMaf production called Nagalase ( \u03b1-N-acetylgalactosaminidase ) that prevent macrophages from becoming the M1 surveillance and attack minded phagocytosing macrophages that are so vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIf macrophages do not become activated , then the vital antigen presenting activities simply do not happen .\nWhich prevents the stimulation of additional immune cells such as the neutrophils and monocytes , which release toxic agents designed to kill extracellular pathogens .\nWhen these chemical messengers are released , they increase the self-stimulation effect of the overall immune system , recruiting and transferring the activation of macrophages to all other immune cells , which in turn helps build the rapid attack and destruction of problematic foreign cells and invading organisms .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nagalase has when it prevents the precursor GcGlobulin being converted to GcMaf , is that it has a catastrophic effect on the overall immune systems communication channels .\nIt is like pulling the plug on the internet , it breaks the chain of communication .\nFor it is Macrophages that start the entire immune system \u2019 s communication chain .\nWithout this conversion and the subsequent cascade of chemical messengers and stimulation of additional immune cells the whole system grinds to a halt .\nInstead of being on red alert , the immune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green and in low energy holiday mode .\nit effectively switches off the whole system , like your computer when it goes into sleep mode if left unattended , this is called immunosuppression and is an environment in which cancers and viruses can grow and thrive without any interruption .\nWithout any antigen presentation the rest of the immune system remains lethargic and unresponsive .\nThis GcMaf blocking event was precisely explained by Yamamoto in his paper on his prostate cancer studies .\nHe summarized the lack of stimulation of macrophages succinctly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phagocytic and antigen-presenting cells .\nBecause macrophage activation for phagocytosis and antigen presentation to B and T lymphocytes is the first ( and ) indispensable step in the development of both humoral and cellular immunity , lack of macrophage activation leads to immunosuppression.\n\u201d ( Immunotherapy of Prostate Cancer with GcMaf .\nYamamoto et al.\n, Translational Oncology Vol .\n1 , No .\n2 , 2008 . )\nAs stated , above even when extremely low amounts of Nagalase are detected , the indication is that there is cancer , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is secreted by cancer cells and viruses .\nThe malignant and viral entities that make Nagalase are not otherwise present .\nA positive Nagalase test therefore confirms that a cancer ( or a nasty virus ) is starting to grow within us .\nWith enough samples and study monitoring tumor sizes ( tumor load ) , the Nagalase concentration could also be used to effectively determine overall tumor growth .\nUnfortunately , though , this Nagalase : Tumor ratio is currently only suitable for each patient , as determining a universal indicator for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to project , as each case is different .\nHowever , Nagalase can be useful as an indicator for all cancer sufferers once a base level for that patient has been set , after the first test for all subsequent tests to measure against .\nAs a rising level could potentially indicate cancer tumor growth , whilst a falling level of Nagalase would indicate tumor regression .\nHowever , a general base level could be set by studying and measuring Nagalase levels in people with no infection or cancer , as this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level .\nWhilst subsequent levels over a time period would be the indicator for every individual \u2019 s cancer progression , or regression .\nThis is a remarkable concept , when you consider the scale and research of the cancer industry , for here is a simple , safe blood test that can be used as a useful and accurate diagnostic tool to not only detect , but also monitor the effectiveness of any cancer treatment .\nAlternative cancer treatments are the most effective when it comes to early , small cancers .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to aid the removal of the source of the inflammation that is causing the cancer in the first place .\nThe concept is to \u201c catch it early \u201d rather than waiting until the tumor is established and growth has become unwieldy and out of control .\nAnd is therefore harder to manage .\nInitial cancers with a small number of cells respond most effectively to natural therapies .\nCancers that have become large enough to see on imaging pose a much more significant threat and so require far more drastic measures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment .\nThe current and typical method for diagnosing most cancers occurs only when a tumor mass can be imaged as a mammogram , chest X-ray , or in colonoscopy .\nThis delayed approach requires time and allows the Nagalase concentration levels to be increased depressing the innate immune system further .\nHaving routine blood samples specifically for Nagalase can detect early-stage cancer existing in the body even if not yet able to be observed .\nEarlier less invasive detection methods provide a treatment window with alternative treatments to be started much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therapy does not require early detection , it relies upon the cancer to achieve a stage that can be visualized on scans , X-rays or even physically .\nThe biopsy most often simply confirms what everyone already knows and understands .\nThe use of biomarkers seems to be acceptable in almost all other forms of medical identification except it seems in the field of cancer therapy .\nUsing novel cancer biomarkers such as the Nagalase blood test would mean that biopsies can be avoided entirely , removing the need for sampling tumors .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ potentially catastrophic event of the once contained cancer cells , now let loose , spilling out and circulating around the body to metastasize in new locations .\nBiomarker testing reduces this risk and leaves the cancer cells naturally contained .\nMeasured levels of Nagalase in cancer patients also decrease after surgery , even with the partial removal of a tumor .\nRadiation treatment and chemotherapy have also been shown to provide a decrease in Nagalase levels .\nAny cancer treatment that is effective and therefore is capable of decreasing cancer tumor size or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers ) will show a decrease in corresponding Nagalase levels .\nAdministration with GcMaf ( VDTP ) also shows a decrease in corresponding Nagalase levels .\nTreatment and a decreasing Nagalase level do not mean the cancer has been totally removed .\nContinuous Nagalase measurements giving baseline Nagalase levels would indicate the tumor load has been eradicated .\nBiomarker assay analysis such as Nagalase however , are a cause for concern for the overall regimented and systematically conditioned medical profession .\nThese novel biomarkers are out of the ordinary , whether they help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to adhere to the \u201c norm.\n\u201d and any thinking outside of the pathway , or outside the way they were trained in is difficult to accept .\nIt is a major cause for concern as funding and investment into facilities that are alternative are fraught with issues of understanding and arguably a general lack of personal advancement of knowledge within the profession .\nAnd so , a radical change in approach of both detection and treatment needs to occur to ensure the death rates fall .\nChanges will come , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaches can combine techniques , with GcMaf and targeted antibodies working alongside the electron beam radiation treatments and effective chemotherapy treatments for example .\nAnd then hopefully , eventually this will become the norm when it comes to effectively treating cancer .\nBut we recognize that this is a steep mountain to climb .\nTo highlight this issue of the uptake of new and innovative testing methods by the medical institutions ; An anonymous Russian scientist has developed a novel technique that provides early indications of cancer using a small blood plasma sample @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to Electron Paramagnetic Resonance ( EPR ) ratio .\nComparing the blood of cancer free patients , they can pinpoint the changes in the ESR/EPR pattern to indicate a presence of early cancer .\nThey have enough data on samples , from a pin prick using just a few drops of blood , filtered to remove the red blood cells , to gauge what cancer type is growing .\nThis test is so sensitive they can even detect it as much as 2-3 years in advance before it can be visualized as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system accepted as a routine blood analysis in Russia , all of the hospitals and cancer specialists rejected it .\nSo they approached cancer specialists in the USA in the hope they may be more forward thinking and to discuss the development of the technique in order to help their cancer patients .\nThe same answer came back almost every time .\nThe method is too \u201c novel and detects too early \u201d !\n!\nWhilst \u201c How can a few cells be treated when they can not be visualized , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the location is vital .\nFor this negates and systematically quashes the notion that something like this simple test could if used regularly , create early notice of cancerous cell presence that could then be treated .\nYet it is preferred that the cancer grow to a size large enough for everyone to see it on a scanned image .\nAs we know this is the metastasized stage when the immune system is overrun and become dormant and submissive to the cancer that is now so unwieldy and strong and the chances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that Nagalase testing once available will need to be thoroughly understood by the medical professionals adjusting and adopting new regimens for the successful treatment of early-stage cancers .\nGuidance in this process by a trained professional will be critical .\nFor we can only hope that in the early days of GcMaf availability , until proper accreditation is established , finding a doctor who is experienced in the use of GcMaf and Nagalase testing will be challenging .\nThere is another exciting biomarker test specific for cancer cells and malignant tumors that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Anti-Malignin Antibody Serum assay ( AMAS ) .\nThis assay measures and detects the anti-malignin antibody expressed in > 99 % of patients with tumors and is a very useful initial screening test and can also be used to monitor the effectiveness of any ongoing cancer therapies .\nAs described earlier Cancer cells are generated due to mutations and the presence of mutagens .\nThese regular mutations provide a base level of the anti-malignin antibody .\nThe levels are elevated when cancer is present and decreases to baseline levels when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has accuracy greater than 99 % when duplicate samples are assayed .\nIf a treatment is effective and causes a reduction in a cancer load , the measured AMAS will be reduced .\nA decrease in measured AMAS will occur even if the effective treatment is surgically based on chemotherapy , radiation treatment or an alternative cancer therapy like GcMaf .\nIf the cancer load falls the measured AMAS level also decreases .\nIf the cancer remains , the measured AMAS will also remain positive .\nThe AMAS test simultaneously screens for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biomarkers such as prostate cancer ( PSA measurement ) and colorectal cancer ( CEA ) .\nMuch like the Nagalase test , The AMAS test can highlight the presence of cancers and to follow their regression .\nYet , the anti-malignin antibody is not generated by viruses , so the AMAS assay can not detect these sorts of infections .\nThe Nagalase and AMAS tests should be part of the normal routine blood screening for all susceptible or at-risk people .\nIf Nagalase becomes a standard blood test it can be used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to distinguish between cancers and severe viral infections .\nIt was described earlier that all viruses and cancers express Nagalase .\nThus , high Nagalase levels could be caused by a growing cancer or a viral infection .\nThe anti-malignin antibody is expressed by cancer cells .\nUnderstanding the differences between the measured levels of these two biomarkers helps understand and determine the type of infection .\nIf the levels of both Nagalase and AMAS are measured and are deemed to be higher than the average normal baselines , then cancer is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is raised and a normal AMAS level is measured , then a viral infection is present .\nThe first research papers on cancer treatment using GcMaf ( VDTP ) were published by Prof. Nobuto Yamamoto .\nThe described work with GcMaf ( VDTP ) started in the 1990 \u2019 s and continues into this current decade .\nThe number of research groups has increased and yet a commercial preparation suitable for regular use as a cancer treatment has not yet been fulfilled .\nThere needs to be a defined production and clinical trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a fully acceptable drug treatment .\nThe use of the GcMaf ( VDTP ) protein has been proven to remove cancer tumors in patients .\nThe details in the papers have provided the information for the preparation of today \u2019 s GcMaf ( VDTP ) .\nYamamoto also detailed his strategy for treatment , whilst his research papers provide an impressive series of science masterpieces , laying the foundations for further progression .\nAll of Yamamoto \u2019 s patients had all received the prior treatments of surgery , chemotherapy , and radiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metastatic disease .\nTheir prognoses at this stage ( due to the metastasized cancers ) were that the secondary tumors were inoperable and untreatable .\nAll of his patients were in the earliest phase of metastatic disease and received GcMaf ( VDTP ) shortly after the standard treatments had been completed .\nAfter several weeks of treatment , it was shown that Yamamoto \u2019 s approach had fully eradicated any metastatic breast , prostate and colon cancers in all the treated patients .\nConventional treatments are effective in reducing tumor load , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on to form metastasized cancers elsewhere , rather than removing all remaining traces of cancer .\nHe worked with patients who the medical oncologists had effectively washed their hands of , with palliative care as the only remaining option .\nIn standard modern medicines terms , cases of metastatic cancer being successfully treated and eradicated are a rare occurrence .\nThis is despite government \u2019 s funding the cancer industry with billions of dollars over the last 50 years .\nPlease note that Yamamoto based his treatment plan on relatively low doses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week ) compared to what we can now use today .\nThe GcMaf ( VDTP ) patient data that Yamamoto presented showed cancer tumor clearance in a reasonably rapid time frame .\nThe breast and prostate cancer patients showed tumor clearance in less than 6 months .\nThe treatment regimen was weekly administration of GcMaf injections .\nThe colorectal cancer patients in the study had a tumor clearance in approximately a year .\nYamamoto diligently followed up these patients over a 5-7-year period and none of his treated patients had any recurrence .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yamamoto \u2019 s innovative work and have repeated tumor clearance in patients .\nThe cancer curative rate observed by Yamamoto was reported to be \u201c dependent on both the number of receptors for the particular antigen on macrophages and the number of antigens on each cell.\n\u201d ( Int .\nJ .\nCancer : 122 , 461\u2013467 ( 2008 ) .\nYamamoto describes the specifics in his breast cancer paper from 200 as : \u201c Thus , the macrophages activated by GcMaf developed an enormous variation of receptors that recognize a variety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viruses ) and abnormalities in malignant cell surfaces .\nThe fundamental nature of macrophages to recognize cell surface abnormality is universal to all types of cancers.\n\u201d Yamamoto found that a weekly administration of 100ng GcMaf to cancer patients provided measured observable benefits of tumor regression on a wide range of cancers .\nYamamoto highlighted this difference in the 2008 prostate cancer paper on the connection between cell surface abnormalities , degree of differentiation , and effectiveness of GcMaf : \u201c Efficacy of GcMaf therapy and curative rates of various cancers by GcMaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer ) cell membrane abnormality , which corresponds to the grade of differentiation of the malignant cells.\n\u201d ( Translational Oncology .\n2008 July ; 1 ( 2 ) : 65\u201372 ) .\nFor late-stage cancers ( stage 4 and beyond ) the recommended dose of GcMaf ( VDTP ) is 3000ng injected daily intramuscularly for a period of 90 days .\nThis equates to 1ml from the 7500ng vial daily .\nEach vial contains 2.5ml .\n36 vials would be needed for the 3 months course .\nThe dose is injected sub\u2013Q @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily for 3 months , this is 18 vials for the 3-month course for best results based on the years of collating research This is in addition to maintaining sufficient vitamin D levels as mentioned above and as part of the overall treatment plan .\nIt goes without saying that there is no one size fits all .\nShould you require personal advise regarding dosing , please email [ email protected ] Undifferentiated tumor cells appear to be more effectively destroyed than differentiated cells .\nCancers cells such as adenocarcinomas breast and prostate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are quickly engulfed and destroyed by activated macrophages .\nCancers such as squamous cell carcinoma cells are attacked by the activated macrophages , but at a slower rate .\nThese cancers all express Nagalase so the administration of GcMaf helps overcome the deficiency allowing a macrophage stimulation to fight off the infection .\nThe diseases that Yamamoto treated included : \u2013 Cancers , including prostate , breast , colon , stomach , liver , lung ( including mesothelioma ) , kidney , bladder , uterus , ovarian , head/neck , brain cancers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated other infections and disease targets and viral infections such as Influenza , Hepatitis type B and Hepatitis type C , Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) Herpes Type 1 and Type 2viruses .\nIn fact , all enveloped viruses appear to be susceptible to activated macrophage destruction .\nHIV\u2014like all viruses\u2014makes Nagalase , the enzyme that blocks GcMaf production .\nWithout GcMaf , macrophages become indolent and the anti-viral immune response shuts down .\nThis allows the HIV infection to spread .\nTo remedy this situation , Dr. Yamamoto simply gave these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ macrophages , which then proceeded to phagocytize all of the viruses .\nThe precise molecular biological pathways and mechanisms involved with HIV , Nagalase , and GcMAF are identical to those for cancer cells , and need not be repeated here .\nIn HIV studies they first showed that HIV patients had high Nagalase levels which correlated with their high HIV RNA levels ( a way to measure the amount of HIV infection ) .\nThen , as he administered GcMAF ( 3000 ng .\n3 x weekly for 12 weeks ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to control levels , and , in tandem with the Nagalase , viral load went down to zero .\nThis data \u201c suggests that these patients were free of both HIV virions and HIV-infected cells.\n\u201d Professor Yamamoto followed these patients for seven years , and their viral load ( HIV-1 RNA ) , CD4 counts ( helper cells , a type of lymphocyte used to evaluate immunocompetence ) , p24 antigen ( HIV-specific antigen ) , viral culture , and Nagalase levels remained normal .\nAll patients continued to be free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HIV patients were excluded from this study .\nAnemia is common in HIV patients .\nThe effect of GcMAF on anemic HIV patients is thus unknown . )\nWork by Nonaka et al 2012 ; using a mouse model demonstrated that treatment with GcMaf ( VDTP ) at a level of 40ng/Kg/d caused an obvious decrease in tumor size .\nLiver cell cancer is detailed as Hepatocellular Cancer ( HCC ) .\nFrom the research work completed and detailed in the scientific paper referenced above ; Nonaka and his co-workers provided the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least two novel functions , namely , an anti-angiogenic activity and tumor killing activity through the activation of macrophages .\nVDTP-maf may therefore represent a new strategy for the treatment of HCC.\n\u201d It can clearly be seen , the difference in tumor size from 6 cancer tumor experimental mice , three having been treated with GcMaf ( VDTP ) .\nFollowing breakthroughs , the next key phase in the field of GcMaf research was that of Ruggiero et al Anticancer Research 35 : 5525-5532 ( 2015 ) on breast cancer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here the blood monitoring and biomarker assay tests were performed and verified by an independent Italian hospital and so adding further credibility to their discoveries .\nA 37-year-old patient presented with adenocarcinoma in her right breast in 1985 .\nThe breast cancer diagnosis was swiftly followed by partial resection surgery , with lymphadenectomy and post-surgical irradiation .\nIn 1999 , at the age of 51 years , the adenocarcinoma had returned to haunt her and so she was diagnosed with breast cancer once more , only this time it was in her left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done on the previous tumor , it is not known whether this was a metastasis of the original cancer , or a newer independent occurrence .\nSo another partial resection mastectomy followed , with anti-estrogen receptor ( ER ) treatment for a further 6 years , as a preventative measure .\nIn March 2014 , at the age of 66 years , following a routine mammography , an infiltrating adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in the remaining part of the right breast .\nIn the proximity of the areola , ( the superior external quadrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mm ( 1.545 mm3 ) with irregular margins was detected and confirmed by ultrasonography .\nImmediately after this diagnosis , the patient underwent ultrasound-guided fine-needle ( 14-gauge ) biopsy , and four specimens from different areas of the lesion were examined , whilst Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) was performed to assess the local extension of the tumor .\n* Hence , we have a case of a woman diagnosed with recurrent breast cancer , but the breakthrough here is the self-administered supplementation diet that she followed for three weeks prior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ketogenic diet rich in olive oil and high doses of Vitamin D3 that led to unexpected positive changes in her tumor markers .\nThe time frame from diagnosis to surgery was only 3 weeks , during that time the patient stuck to a ketogenic diet and self-administered a commercial preparation of oleic acid associated with glycosylated Vitamin D Transport protein , she also enriched her diet with commercial olive oil and fermented milk products also rich in natural glycosylated Vitamin D Transport protein .\nFollowing the surgery , the surgeon gave a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have been removed using two spoons , as it was surrounded by white blood cells [ that ] almost act [ ed ] like a capsule.\n\u201d The following Assays for Progesterone receptors demonstrated a switch from < 1 % to a more normal 20 % and other assays indicated a complete switching off of the HER2 protein and gene , showing great success .\nAnd so what this paper shows is that breast adenocarcinoma can be eradicated using GcMaf , whilst the best use and form of treatment is combination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe GcMaf ( VDTP ) administered was a highly purified preparation and a human form of the macrophage stimulating molecule .\nThis means that the 3-D structure and method of interaction is identical to the same molecules generated in the body .\nIt is therefore a natural molecule in every function .\nThere has never been any mentioned , or recorded adverse reactions , side effects , or toxic reactions to pure GcMaf ( VDTP ) .\nThis includes Yamamoto \u2019 s work and from any other group using purified GcMaf ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is normally by intramuscular ( IM ) injections .\nThis was the favored route by Yamamoto , and others , however advocated the use of subcutaneous and oral delivery .\nOral delivery is used as a buccal delivery by holding the GcMaf ( VDTP ) in the buccal area mainly under the tongue , for uptake through the multiple arteries and veins in the sublingual cavity .\nThe membranes are particularly thin on the lingual artery and lingual veins .\nThe tonsillar branch of the facial artery and the pharyngeal artery are secondary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood supply is full and accessible .\nSome of the GcMaf preparations that were used contained oleic acid and Vitamin D which aids the uptake into the blood vessels .\nParticularly good results in clearing dental cavities were also noted in his work although no direct research papers were generated .\nThey also injected preparations directly into the arteries supplying the pancreas , using ultrasound to follow the needle position .\nUsing this technique , he had good success with treating pancreatic cancer and again he presented results at several meetings , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yamamoto worked on early small tumors that had been de-bulked and reduced in size .\nThe cancers were solid and had not metastasized .\nYamamoto had a success rate that was close to 100 % when using GcMaf ( VDTP ) therapy .\n*The MRI , the surgery , and the analyses on estrogen receptor ( ER ) , progesterone receptor ( PgR ) , human epidermal growth factor receptor ( HER2 ) and nuclear protein Ki67 ( both on the preoperative biopsy and on the surgical specimens ) were performed at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) of Firenze , Italy .\nAnalyses were performed according to the European standards of quality ( UNI EN ISO 9001:2008 ) and were examined and countersigned by four different medical professionals .\nThe pivotal paper was for advanced breast adenocarcinoma , alas other groups are reluctant to publish their findings on GcMaf ( VDTP ) treatments and any successes they have had for fear of reprisal .\nWhilst as many of you will know the wider pharmaceutical industry has curbed much of GcMaf \u2018 s ( VDTP ) untapped potential and often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many retractions .\nDespite this , the slow increase of GcMaf ( VDTP ) treatments has driven the need for biomarker assays being used as a routine assay .\nSome work was being performed by the University Hospital of Groningen , but the wider field of oncologists and hematologists declined the use of this technology for the same reason as above .\nEarly detection provides complex issues as it could not be seen on a screen and therefore , they couldn \u2019 t treat the patient .\nSo yet again the patients must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a major issue for the patient .\nThe need for Nagalase and AMAS as routine assays is becoming an important step in the cancer treatment process .\nNagalase/AMAS can therefore be used to monitor the effectiveness of any cancer treatment , including both drug and alternative therapies , separately or in combination .\nAs you will now be aware , there are several major advantages that GcMaf have over a number of conditions and diseases .\nAs the number of quiet researchers has increased so has the number of disease targets .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways of using GcMaf in the laboratory to elucidate its modes of direct action .\nFor we have covered the stimulation of macrophages for fighting cancer and infectious disease .\nWe have also mentioned that GcMaf is bound to Vitamin D as it is used to carry Vitamins D throughout the bloodstream .\nIt can also bind ( VDTP ) oleic acid and actin .\nSo as a messenger molecule it can switch on specific protein pathways as well as switch some pathways off .\nThe number is unknown and further research is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switched on and off , as almost every cell has a Vitamin D receptor , the potential number of switches is immense .\nThe research is a continuous flow as the knowledge is being worked on every day and constantly updated and so will be reported when new information and clinical results become available .\nThe effects of Gc protein-derived macrophage-activating factor ( GcMaf ) ( VDTP ) have been studied in cancer and other conditions where angiogenesis is deregulated .\nIn this study , we demonstrate for the first time that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells ( PBMCs ) to GcMaf ( VDTP ) was associated with 3\u2032-5\u2032-cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) formation .\nThe effect was dose dependent , and maximal stimulation was achieved using 0.1 ng/ml .\nHeparin inhibited the stimulatory effect of GcMaf on PBMCs .\nIn addition , we demonstrate that GcMaf ( VDTP ) 1 ng/ml ) inhibited prostaglandin E ( 1 ) - and human breast cancer cell-stimulated angiogenesis in chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane ( CAM ) assay .\nFinally , we tested different GcMaf preparations on CAM , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproducible and inexpensive method to determine the relative potencies of different preparations and their stability ; we observed that storage at room temperature for 15 days decreased GcMaf potency by about 50 % .\nThese data could prove useful for upcoming clinical trials on GcMaf .\nGc protein-derived macrophage-activating factor ( GcMaf ) / ( VDTP ) immunotherapy has been steadily advancing over the last two decades .\nOral colostrum macrophage-activating factor ( MAF ) produced from bovine colostrum has shown high macrophage phagocytic activity .\nGcMaf ( VDTP ) -based immunotherapy has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many diseases via macrophage activation or for use as supportive therapy .\nThree case studies demonstrate that oral colostrum MAF can be used for serious

generate their own blood supply .\nCancer As stated earlier , cancer tumors secrete proteins that promote the generation of blood vessels , a process known as angiogenesis .\nObviously , the greater the number of blood vessels , the greater the chance that cancer has to acquire nutrients and therefore grow more rapidly .\nIf the number of blood vessels , or growth is restricted , then the tumor growth itself could be reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if agents can stop the angiogenesis using embryos in chicken eggs called the chorioallantoic membrane model ( CAM ) .\nIt allows a direct delivery of

membrane showing blood vessels that give an instant easy to read result .\nUsually a photo is taken and the blood vessels projecting from the fertilised egg are counted .\nThe assay used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E and human breast cancer cells causing the observed blood vessel formation .\nThe angiogenesis caused by the prostaglandin E and human breast cancer cell was reversed when in the presence of 1ng/mL of GcMaf ( VDTP ) .\nGcMaf was therefore shown to cause an inhibition of angiogenesis .\nThe effect is observable at extremely low levels , highlighting the effectiveness of GcMaf and conversely how potent Nagalase is at stopping normal levels of GcMaf having the desired effect .\nThis reference details the work generated for the CAM assay : \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protein-derived macrophage-activating factor ( GcMaf ) stimulates cAMP formation in human mononuclear cells and inhibits angiogenesis in chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane assay .\nCancer Immunol Immunother

bind oleic acid which has come under extreme interest as it is a molecule that instigates apoptosis .\nIt is able to be delivered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , cancer cells are faster growing than normal cells so the membranes of cancer cells are more fluid as they are constantly being stretched and split so oleic acid can enter the cells easily once GcMaf ( VDTP ) has attached to the appropriate receptor

improved in the presence of GcMaf .\nCertain conditions that are known to decrease neuronal interactions have been shown to be alleviated by using GcMaf .\nSuch as : With research also showing an alleviatiation of neuronal pain in rat models , as shown in this reference .\nThe pictures below show the human SH-SY5Y neuronal cells cultured in the absence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is clear to see that the cells cultured in the presence of 8pM of GcMaf ( VDTP ) have numerous cell interactions with neighboring cells and have an overall better cell membrane content .\nIt is as if the cells are looking

know that GcMaf ( VDTP ) can stimulate macrophages to clear and find the metastasized cancer cells very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a choice and perhaps some benefit on non-surgical tumors or after all treatments have been attempted .\nHowever , the most beneficial is combination therapy as first used in treating a breast adenocarcinoma patient ( as stated above ) who prior to surgery received GcMaf

elevated Nagalase level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its mass can not be seen using the typical procedures , as we have now learnt it can be confirmed by a panel of typical cancer biomarker assays .\nObviously in an ideal world this would be the time to start GcMaf ( VDTP ) treatment , to be then monitored by Nagalase level testing .\nBut if a tumor has grown to such a degree that it is large enough to be

the individual \u2019 s optimum dose .\nPoor levels of Vitamin D mean poor levels of Vitamin D transport protein , meaning poor levels of GcMaf in times of need .\nOnce a cancer , or infection has begun then Nagalase will easily mop up low levels of Vitamin D transport protein and prevent its conversion to GcMaf ( VDTP ) .\nHence external GcMaf ( VDTP ) is required , to help rebalance the ratio

slightly longer to readdress the balance and \u201c get over the hill \u201d to treat the infection when taking this specific medication .\nOpiates : \u2013 According to Prof. Yamamoto , opiates derived medicines such as morphine , Demerol , opium , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Vicodin , and Norco may also block GcMaf ( VDTP ) macrophage activating effect .\nAs yet , there are no further published studies on this .\nAnemia : \u2013 A lack of sufficient red blood cells may also compromise GcMaf ( VDTP ) overall effectiveness .\nAnemic patients were excluded from all of the studies .\nThis may be because of suitable recovery , or additional complications .\nAgain , as yet there are no published studies on this aspect of GcMaf ( VDTP ) and anemia .\nInsufficient macrophages : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a large

provides crucial information about cancer progress .\nGood intentions coupled with poor training can lead to disaster .\nAnyone who allows a novice to administer GcMaf ( VDTP ) is making a big mistake .\nGcMaf ( VDTP ) administration must always be monitored by a physician who is trained in its use .\nRather than a substitute for conventional cancer therapy , GcMaf ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nGcMaf ( VDTP ) effectiveness depends on optimum administration of conventional mainstream cancer therapies .\nThe GcMaf ( VDTP ) available from suppliers can range greatly in quality .\nThe emergence of GcMaf ( VDTP ) therapy and Nagalase testing as viable methods for treating and preventing cancer will inevitably be accompanied by genuine concern and debate about how best to put these valuable tools to work .\nThere will always be the denigrators of GcMaf ( VDTP ) available based upon little knowledge .\nPeople tend to gravitate towards negative reviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Therefore , the supplier must always be able to provide their own independent data on the results of the material they offer and be able to explain these results in detail .\nAny good supplier will be able to discuss GcMaf ( VDTP ) with

.\nBecause it is identical ( ie.\n, bio-identical ) to what the body produces naturally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symptoms of any kind .\nAdministration does raise the temperature a little , not excessively , but that is normal .\nThere should never be any rashes at the entry point , no coughing , or any other adverse reactions displayed .\nIf any such symptoms do appear in an individual taking GcMaf then

come together to form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individually tailored therapies and treatment plans for patients that the medical establishment has failed .\nAs a startup company , backed by decades of professional scientific and clinical expertise , new cutting-edge therapies are now available worldwide .\nGcMaf ( VDTP ) has been proven to be safe and effective in the treatment of a variety of illnesses and diseases .\nThe latest research findings are indicating it has many more benefits than originally believed .\nAs it is a naturally occurring protein that is produced in the bodies of all healthy people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adverse side effects .\nIn effect , it is the right jigsaw piece to fill the deficiency and completes the whole picture .\nIt is not an additive to mask the hole in the way allopathic medicine is used .\nVigor Life in Bulgaria and Saisei Marai in Japan are the only companies producing genuine bioidentical GcMaf in the world that is pure , unadulterated and consistently \u2018 active \u2019 leaving it as the most effective product of its kind .\nAll other producers of GcMaf have either stopped production , halted export @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave their finished product unavailable beyond their borders , diluted , inert or even potentially harmful .\nMany proponents of GcMaf ( VDTP ) are hailing it as a \u2018 magic bullet \u2019 for cancer and other diseases , however they are doing as much harm to people \u2019 s perception of it as are the detractors .\nVigor Life uses GcMaf ( VDTP ) only as part of a treatment plan in conjunction to strict adherence to the prescribed protocol of their doctor .\nIt is reckless to think that GcMaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cure .\nThis is why Vigor Life only distributes through certified and licensed medical practitioners that possess extensive knowledge and experience in immunotherapy .\nThey offer full spectrum support and advice for everyone using or considering GcMaf as part of their health regime .\nInterest in GcMaf ( VDTP ) has exploded around the world which has resulted in many more avenues of research into the role it plays throughout the body .\nThe scientists and doctors at Vigor Life are at the forefront of this push to discover more about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protein contains only molecules of a single protein , and no other molecules of any kind .\nImpurities cause compromised effectiveness , adverse reactions , and symptoms of toxicity .\nMaking \u201c pure \u201d GcMaf ( VDTP ) is not a simple undertaking .\nSeveral groups now generate GcMaf to high standards .\nThe methods of Yamamoto have been refined and improved .\nSome can use your own blood ( apparently ) although it is best to use external GcMaf before sending your own blood , as is the case with the Saisei-Mirai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oral version , based upon the yoghurt production of the Bravo system .\nThey also have a high concentration Version 2 which they use in the same approach as the one Yamamoto prescribed .\nThe methodology of GcMaf ( VDTP ) production is not onerous to learn and a good laboratory can make GcMaf relatively easily .\nHowever , the skill set lies with the preparation and the assurance that no contamination is present and that the vial preparations are also stored appropriately .\nThe administration of impure , or non-bio-identical , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high potential for side effects and adverse reactions .\nIt also might not stimulate macrophages appropriately .\nThe importance of establishing a GcMaf c ( VDTP ) verifying authority can not be overstated .\nThis approach is being worked towards by groups such as Effram but as , yet no clinical data has been provided , discussed , or presented .\nThere has been a rise in production of the yoghurt GcMaf by Bravo and others .\nThese preparations use many probiotic bacteria that can use the enzymes in the GcMaf ( VDTP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the probiotic bacteria use the milk sugars and proteins to grow and secrete the enzymes and convert the GcGlobulin in the milk , or colostrum to generate VDTP/GcMaf .\nThis GcMaf is in a bovine form , that is to say , from cows , as the milk used is likely to be cow \u2019 s milk .\nBovine VDTP/GcMaf can stimulate macrophages in lab cultures and so it is assumed that it can also do this in the human body .\nThe issue here is that once a live culture is consumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s journey through to the gut .\nHowever , it is likely that the buccal cavity would be the ideal absorption area for GcMaf ( VDTP ) probiotic .\nA lot of \u201c variables \u201d occur with the non-targeted yoghurt approach and there has not as yet been any concentration data of GcMaf ( VDTP ) in the probiotic preparations , nor any conversion rates provided .\nSo further research is needed .\nIt is true that probiotics will aid your gut flora , but the \u201c conversion \u201d relies upon bacterial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in each batch , the bacteria will grow at exactly the same rate , meaning each batch ( if it does contain GcMaf ( VDTP ) ) will come in differing concentrations , if at all .\nContamination occurs when a foreign agent gets into the GcMaf product from the outside , or as part of the manufacturing process .\nContaminants can cause symptoms similar to impurities , including fatigue , weakness , malaise , muscle and joint pain .\nSuch contaminants can be airborne or carried into the ( otherwise sterile ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Entering a biotech production facility is like dressing for a walk-in outer space : cap , gloves , full body gown , mask , boots .\nOxygen tanks are not required , but the air must be filtered to remove dust , toxic chemicals , and pathogenic microorganisms .\nIt is therefore necessary to establish a consumer protection certification program as soon as possible , whereby the product generated will be subjected to industry standard rigorous testing and then certified for both purity and activity .\nOne of the preparations available has taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ samples from batches subjected to a rigorous identification and purity study on a number of samples throughout the manufacturing process to assess the presence of any contamination and materials used in the preparation .\nHere we present some of these results that were presented for review .\nOne of the assay methods developed ( along with the normal bioanalytical approach ) is to use liquid chromatography , coupled with mass spectrometry ( LC-MS ) .\nThis analytical method is extremely robust and sensitive .\nIt can separate proteins and identify them based upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is presented and assessed against a large protein database .\nThis is because all proteins respond differently and therefore can be distinguished as single precise entities .\nThe results are presented as below tested from Vigorlife GcMaf in Bulgaria .\nIn essence what this shows is that the final preparation contains the correct mass of protein for GcMaf ( VDTP ) .\nThere is only one peak which also shows that the preparation is pure and there is only GcMaf ( VDTP ) present .\nThere is no contamination of any other proteins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This tells us that the conversion of the precursor GcGlobulin is complete and 100 % converted .\nThe protein is also cut up using specific enzymes that can cut proteins at specific points .\nIt is this pattern that is unique for each protein , when it is measured on the mass spectrometry analysis of digested material .\nThe second figure below , shows the mass spectrum of the peak at 10.05min from the sample above .\nThis mass spectrum does not show the mass of the molecule directly , but the data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiple charged ions , ranging from 40 to 25 positive charges , which is difficult to interpret , despite the high resolution of the mass analyzer .\nIsotopic peaks are not possible to be determined , since the huge mass of the molecule expected around 52900Da , so deconvolution was carried out which has a lower accuracy , based on different charged states and manual peak picking .\nSeveral of the peaks from the spectrum generated above are further reconstructed using software to provide an accurate estimate of the molecular weight of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the molecular weight of the GcMaf is assigned to 52900Da which is a mass that is expected for GcMaf ( VDTP ) .\nThe molecular weights of the two enzymes used : Neuraminidase ( approx .\n95kDa ) and Galactosidase ( approx .\n540kDa ) were also monitored with the assay in samples through the process .\nThey are shown here below for clarity and to highlight that the profile is easily observed to be different from GcMaf ( VDTP ) .\nThe next figure illustrates the Total ion current chromatograms of samples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from top to bottom .\nA straight red line is drawn to show retention time shifts for each of the individual samples .\nFigure 5 .\nChromatograms of Final and Process Samples Respectively Please see the following figure below .\nThe top chromatogram is of the end product GcMaf in the container .\nThe bottom chromatogram is of the end product GcMaf after processing , prior to being filled in the container .\nNotice that there has not been any difference in the profiles due to any storage issues .\nThe third chromatogram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is a slight expected difference in this sample , due to the presence of Sialic acid and galactoside hydrophilic sugar residues , which are still attached to the molecule .\nThe fourth chromatogram is of the GcGlobulin having been treated with the \u03b2-Galactosidase .\nHere you can see a slight change as one of the sugars is removed .\nYou can see the profile for the GcGlobulin and the \u03b2-Galactosidase ie there are two peaks present .\nThe final bottom chromatogram is after the material has been treated with neuraminidase .\nYou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the neuraminidase ie there are two peaks present The Peak areas of the protein in the first 3 chromatograms proportionally correspond to its concentration ( if there is a standard substance to compare it to ) .\nThe experimental work of developing of an LC-hr MS method for qualitative and quantitative analysis of GcMaf ( VDTP ) proved that the intact protein could be successfully determined in samples with moderate to simple compositional weight , in concentrations starting from 0,1\u00b5g/ml to about 3 orders of higher magnitude , but with additional optimization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets of samples , the evaluation of the results demonstrates several facts : \u2022 Sample 4 and 5 are clear of enzymes .\nThe preparation is pure and completely converted .\n\u2022 Converted protein can withstand low pH of about 2,2 and high temperature of about 70\u2103 for at least 10 minutes during chromatographic separation .\nThis is important for a viral removal step .\n\u2022 The approximate mass of the converted protein is similar to the theoretical expected mass of about 52963Da .\n\u2022 There is partial proof of the existence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , there is no evidence of the enzymes in the material in the end process , or in the final filled material .\n\u2022 The developed procedure could complement and/or substitute all analytical procedures from the second stage of the conversion process protocol with a substantial saving of resources and consumption of about 10\u00b5l sample ( 20\u00b5l in vial ) for 3 determinations .\nThis finally produced GcMaf ( VDTP ) product could even be used as an analytical standard for future quantitative work and MS determinations .\nThe fact that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quantitation of total proteins , respectively attributing the total protein concentration to this one protein for exact determination of its quantity .\nThese results have been completed and thus generate an analytical standard that can be further used in the future .\nGiven the emergence of the Covid-19 ( sars2 ) virus , it is perhaps prudent to examine the data and research that is available ( Dec/2020 ) at this time .\nThere is now no doubt among the independent scientific community , particularly those involved in the research of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to CRISPR ( a gene editing technique ) manipulation .\nDNA analysis of this virus is showing similarities to HIV sequences of RNA and DNA that appear to have been inserted into a naturally occurring coronavirus .\nIt is important to understand that coronaviruses have been in existence for an exceedingly long time and are responsible for many , normally minor , infections .\nThis gene editing characteristic is why it is labelled \u2018 novel \u2019 .\nUnder no circumstances can such a mutation occur in nature , in a single leap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe particular gene sequence , suspected to have been inserted , does not confer upon the virus a greater potency or virulence when it comes to the immediate symptoms .\nThe \u2018 gain of function \u2019 that is desired by those that developed this virus , is to have longevity of infection and by extension , the production of antibodies .\nThese antibodies can remain in the person \u2019 s system for many months after eradicating the initial infection and indicate not just a prior infection , even if the host has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet reveal a positive test result ( via the flawed PCR ) that demands quarantine .\nIt is assumed the host is still sick and , more importantly , contagious .\nHowever , the primary objective of most corona viruses ( including CovID19 ) is to infect and multiply within the respiratory system .\nThe lungs are where most of your macrophages reside and are the first line of defense against such infections .\nThe lungs are the battleground and subsequently where we find the most severe symptoms associated with this type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having a dormant or weak immune response towards this initial point of entry for viruses , is extremely dangerous and proves that macrophage activation to fight off these pathogens is vital to the elimination of infection .\nGCMAF ( VDTP ) , when coupled with an immunity boosting protocol , will naturally eliminate the infection and confer the chemical memory upon the macrophages in such a way as to provide lifelong immunity for subsequent exposures .\nFurther research is needed to confirm this hypothesis and Vigor Life will be at the vanguard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of research related to this inquiry .\nGcMaf ( VDTP ) has been proven to be safe and effective in the treatment of a variety of viral illnesses and other diseases .\nThe latest research findings are indicating it has many more benefits than originally believed .\nAs it is a naturally occurring protein that is produced in the bodies of all healthy people , by default , it has no adverse side effects .\nIn effect , it is the right jigsaw piece to fill the deficiency and completes the whole picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppressor \u2019 to mask the hole in the way allopathic medicine is used .\nThe mRNA vaccine that was pushed through the FDA approval process ( Dec/2020 ) is expected to permanently trigger the production of antibodies with the intention of conferring lifelong immunity .\nThere are conflicting schools of thought on this approach , arguing that there are no successful clinical trials that prove this approach to be safe and effective .\nWith the immune system in a constant state of elevated preparedness , the likelihood of over reaction to a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the symptoms of such worsened .\nAccording to the \u2018 law of unintended consequences \u2019 what also is unclear are the many side effects that are dismissed as \u2018 inconsequential \u2019 or of low incidence .\nThere is nothing in the scientific literature that proves or even supports this claim .\nThe role that GcMaf plays in both immune system activation and modulation , to maintain the appropriate response , demands further research .\nAs mentioned above , the side effects of vaccines disprove their safety and efficacy .\nThey are neither .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States of America , should not be unexpected when observed in the context of their childhood vaccination programme .\nIt has been shown in some studies that GcMaf ( VDTP ) can help with the injury that has been proven to be caused by vaccinations .\nThe adjuvants used in these vaccines contain a cocktail of toxins completely unrelated to the actual pathogen that the vaccine is supposed to immunize the recipient from .\nIt is these toxic compounds that are responsible for the damage that is being done .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ is inhibited by the presence of these toxins .\nAs we also know that GcMaf activates the \u2018 clean up \u2019 cells within the immune system , if these cells then clear away the debris of dead cells , damaged cells and the toxins that caused the damage , would it not then follow that cell regeneration would be allowed to occur more efficiently in the absence of these toxins ?\nVigor Life is pursuing research along this line of enquiry .\nThe USA is the most heavily medicated and vaccinated nation on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vast number of previously ( before the mass vaccination programmes ) low incidence illnesses , many of which are auto-immune related .\nMultiple sclerosis , lupus , rheumatism and arthritis , ME , CFS , Lyme disease to name just

POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC IMPLICATIONS", "content": "Vitamin D has multiple mechanisms that reduce the risk of microbial infection and death , including natural cellular immunity , physical barrier , and adaptive immunity .\nVitamin D supplementation has yielded favourable effects in viral infections , including influenza and HIV .\nThe results of vitamin D supplementation during COVID-19 infection remains controversial .\nWith the endless panorama , it has been found that vitamin D mitigates the scope of acquired immunity and regenerates endothelial lining .\nIf you wonder what potential role vitamin D supplementation can play in COVID-19 infection , read on !\nVitamin D3 production is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiation reaching 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin .\nFollowing this reaction , vitamin D3 is converted in the liver to 25 ( OH ) D , and then kidneys & other organs convert it into hormonal metabolite 1,25 ( OH ) 2D ( calcitriol ) [ 1,2 ] .\nCalcitriol contributes to regulating serum calcium concentrations to modify many important functions in the human body [ 3 ] .\nVitamin D contributes majorly to reducing the risk of microbial infection .\nThis mainly involves actions grouped into natural cellular immunity , physical barriers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vitamin D is known to strengthen cellular immunity , partly through the induction of antimicrobial peptides , while maintaining gap junctions , tight junctions , and adherens junctions [ 5,6 ] .\nFurthermore , 1,25 ( OH ) 2D-vitamin D receptor acts on the cathelicidin gene promoter vitamin D response elements to enhance transcription of cathelicidin [ 7 ] .\nCOVID-19 subjects reflect innate immune system behaviour in response to bacterial and viral infections , generating pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines [ 8 ] .\nVitamin D reduces the production of pro-inflammatory T helper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines by macrophages .\nIt also favours T regulatory ( Treg ) cells , thus inhibiting inflammatory processes .\nVitamin D concentrations in serum can be reduced by antineoplastics , antiepileptics , antibiotics , antihypertensives , anti-inflammatory agents , antiretrovirals , endocrine drugs , and some herbal medicines activation of the pregnane-X receptor .\nThe effects of vitamin D on the immune system can be seen here in a figure !\nVitamin D supplementation in winters seems to reduce the risk of contracting influenza .\nThe potential benefits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in HIV infection .\nBaseline vitamin D levels , especially those lower than 32 ng/mL , are independently associated with a more advanced HIV stage progression .\nThese findings confirm the potential benefits of vitamin D administration in HIV patients .\nImmunotherapy for cancer & oral immunotherapy is already famous for treating cancer , autism and other chronic diseases .\nStudies prove the potential impact of vitamin D supplementation in COVID-19 patients with observations that vitamin D has a prominent role in reducing the risk of COVID-19 .\nVitamin D supplementation can enhance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aggressive effect on organ systems .\nHigh-dose vitamin D supplementation is a must for subjects with confirmed deficiency , particularly those in higher age groups , obese , with dark skin , and population residing at higher latitudes .\nBased on protective effects in patients at risk of chronic diseases , including cardiovascular disease , cancers , respiratory tract infections , diabetes mellitus , and hypertension .\nVitamin D supplementation can reduce the incidence and severity of various viral diseases , including COVID-19 [ 9 ] .\nACE2 is the receptor that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intestine and alveoli , with dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin system .\nThis also contributes to massive cytokine activation , potentially fatal in ARDS .\nHowever , vitamin D deficiency can add to airway/gastrointestinal infections .\nThis is why some researchers suggest that vitamin D may be a potential therapeutic approach to fight against COVID-19 and induced ARDS .\nAlthough any protective effect of vitamin D against COVID-19 is related to the suppression of cytokine response , this seems possible that vitamin D prophylaxis can decrease the severity of infection caused by COVID-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is common [ 10 ] .\nSome studies suggest that persistent deficiency in vitamin D level may activate RAS , which is solely responsible for inducing lung fibrosis [ 11 ] .\nHypovitaminosis D promotes renin-angiotensin system ( RAS ) and chronic activation , leading to chronic CVD and decreased lung function .\nCOVID-19 infection downregulates ACE2 function , leading to toxic angiotensin II over-accumulation .\nThis , in turn , contributes to ARDS or fulminant myocarditis .\nHypovitaminosis D increases the risk for thrombosis , and vitamin D controls the expression of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apoptosis , differentiation , and angiogenesis .\nThe overall conclusions drawn in most studies suggest that administration of a high dose of 25 ( OH ) vitamin D can significantly decrease the need to hospitalise COVID-19 patients .\nThe reported literature concerning the effects of vitamin D supplementation might need more research and evidence to present its credibility .\nBut the proven efficiency of GcMAF/VDTP in treating immune diseases can never be neglected .\nWith a high scope of immunotherapy helping cancer and chronic diseases patients , Vitamin D can also be utilized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like SARS-COV2 and the resulting implications .\nHere \u2019 s how you can determine and evaluate levels of Vitamin D in your body !\nRead in this book , more about VDTP/GcMAF .\nSince the pathology of COVID-19 involves a complex interaction between COVID-19 and the immune system , vitamin D has multiple immunomodulating actions to perform .\nVitamin D favours the ability of macrophages to mature & prevents macrophages from releasing too many inflammatory cytokines and chemokines , thus , having favourable effects in treating numerous viral infections .\nBut , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world is low in Vitamin D , makes it a difficult scenario .\nAccording to data procured from a German study , people who have had their double doses of vaccine are now on the same scale as those with HIV and AIDS , low on essential vitamins , so they are in real need of Vitamin D. Finally , the hope for such ailments can only remain high if we adopt a healthy lifestyle and stop portraying COVID-19 like a monster !\nIt \u2019 s just an infection associated with immunity , @ @ @

"source": "healingoracle", "title": "IS IT POSSIBLE TO OVERDOSE ON CBD OIL AND CANNABIS?", "content": "A question we often get asked is a simple and valid question : Can you overdose on marijuana ?\nHere we address this question and offer you further advice on the best types of cannabis oil .\nIn fact ground breaking research in the 1990s discovered that we all contain 2 different vital Cannabinoid receptors ( CB ) that are essential to our mental and physical health and that we have an endocannabinoid system within us that is hard wired to receive this medicine .\nBut let \u2019 s return to the question , \u201c can I overdose on cannabis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have to smoke a whopping 1,500 lbs in less than 15 minutes .\nIn response to that very question , please see this video from Sunilaggarwa Kumar Aggarwal , MD , PhD .\nPhysician-scientist , medical geographer , see his Facebook account here As described in the video : \u201c No matter how much humans have consumed , people have tried to consume large quantities , either through inhaling the smoke of lots and lots of buds/flowers , which is where the active ingredients are found , or they \u2019 ve tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers into solvents like butter , oil or alcohol .\nWell , too much alcohol can certainly kill you but the compounds in marijuana , even if Just a high concentrated variety of it can \u2019 t stop your breathing , can \u2019 t cause you to have a seizure as far as we know .\nPossibly in some cases for people who are predisposed these things can happen , but generally speaking , there \u2019 s no recorded deaths just related to the use of the product itself , and no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can use too much of something if you were expecting a certain effect .\nNow if you wanted to have a stress relieving effect with marijuana , but still wanted to be functional and you know , active , you can use so much the point where you become sedated and maybe a little bit agitated and that phenomenon can cause problems for people and that \u2019 s what we call an overdose quote .\nIt \u2019 s not an overdose to the point where you have , you know , you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need to be pumped out of your stomach with a substance , that kind of phenomenon is not what I \u2019 m describing .\nAlso , you might end up having a paranoid or psychotic reaction with a high use of something that had psychologically activating properties .\nPeople call that an acute cannabis psychosis and that \u2019 s been described , often-times that does not lead to any chronic long-term change in your psychological status , like , or you \u2019 re permanently this way , just until it clears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less .\nThese are , we \u2019 re talking extremely large doses for some of these effects .\nEveryone has a different pharmacology , different chemistry , a different reaction to drugs .\nSo the important thing is that people when they \u2019 re using a psychologically activating substances pace themselves , that they know how much they \u2019 re using and wait before taking more and that \u2019 s very commonly happens when you take marijuana orally like in foods or dissolve things , there \u2019 s a large delay in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour \u2013 hour-and-a-half , and by that time if you are waiting for an effect and if used more and more , you can have a kind of a unpleasant surprise , a high amount of sedation or as I was mentioning agitation .\nWith smoking or inhalation , vaporisation , the onset is more immediate , so you really able to just gauge within a minute or two whether this is the right amount , whether you \u2019 re trying to relieve a symptom or you \u2019 re trying to achieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s important when you \u2019 re in a social setting and using marijuana or you \u2019 re sharing with other people , people will have different set points and that \u2019 s I think the bottom line , the key thing to remember .\nThere are also alternative ways to consume marijuana .\nFor example in oil form , some may say this is a safer way to consume marijuana and has many positive effects on your health .\nAfter all , it is completely naturally sourced .\nThe following oil ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is derived from coconuts .\nWe all know that coconuts are really good for us .\nThe humble coconut has gathered much fame for its health benefits over the last decade as an oil , a milk and a drink amongst others .\nSo it is no surprise that MCT oil made from coconuts has some magical qualities .\nWhen you consume ( eat or drink it ) , the MCT \u2019 s are easily digested and head straight for your liver .\nMCT molecules are smaller than those in most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LCT ] ) which makes them easier to digest.\n\u201d So what are the best types of cannabis oil ?\nFull spectrum , organic , pesticide free cannabis is obviously better for you than anything grown under artificial lights as full spectrum means its been grown outdoors in the sunshine and has retained all those essential minerals and not anything artificial .\nPlease see here for more : CANNABIS OIL TODAY \u2013 Healing Oracle MCT oil has many health benefits .\nOne of it \u2019 s stand out features are that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help your body make ketones which is an energy source for your brain that doesn \u2019 t have any carbohydrates .\nIf you have a cognitive disorder , then adding some MCT oil to your diet will help you recover cognitive abilities and can also restore memory .\nResearch indicates that MCT oil also helps with pain , inflammation , sleep , relaxation , arthritis and more .\nThe science behind MCT oil is relatively simple , but also incredibly effective .\nMCTs go directly from the digestive system to the bloodstream , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes MCT oil ideal for people with digestive disorders .\nIn our experience , this quick delivery directly into the bloodstream means that the cannabis infused MCT oil effects are quicker than other fat based infusions .\nBest ways to take it Administering medical cannabis ( full spectrum ) oil rectally is the most appropriate route for most patients .\nCultural sensitivities , as well as misinformation regarding insertion methods , may be barriers to the practice .\nIn addition to being a viable option for patients who can \u2019 t ingest cannabis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather than orally are : \u2022 It starts to work quicker at around 10\u201315 minutes , compared to orally where it might not be felt for 30\u201390 minutes , as it has to travel through the intestine and liver \u2022 It lasts for a longer period of time ( 4 to 8 hours ) \u2022 It \u2019 s 50-70 percent more efficient , whilst digesting cannabis oil by mouth is only around 20 percent efficient and therefore has a \u201c superior bio-availability \u201d As well as being a more effective route of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side effects that the oral administration may induce such as gastric irritation , nausea and vomiting ( Tortora and Derrickson , 2008 ) .\nEuphoric effect .\nYou will feel less of the THC effect than by mouth , which will have a greater impact on your day and improve

United States for 2022 are : \u2022 About 268,490 new cases of prostate cancer About 1 man in 8 will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during his lifetime , whilst it is also more likely to develop in

does prostate cancer begin ?\nIf we are to look at a root cause .\nAsking the question of \u201c why ?\n\u201d is something oncologists are discouraged to do .\nCause and effect are most often ignored in the bigger picture .\nThe wheels of industry do not allow for this type of individual thought process .\nMost cancer patients will feel , once the diagnosis is given , that they have zero choice , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chances with the devastating side effects .\nThey find themselves at the top of a blind and scary alley .\nIs there a light at the end , or does it lead to further problems that mean life will never be the same again ?\nYour immune system needs nutrition and Vitamin D Perhaps another way to see this is that these signs come as a warning to us all .\nIts not the end , in fact it could be the beginning of changes that are needed .\nAnd we can start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease within .\nIn fact , so often it is only through our own efforts that we can overcome disease .\nOr indeed anything .\nThe human body is extremely well designed .\nIt was however , not designed for the modern diet and lifestyle .\nGiven the proximity of mobile phones , poor diet and lack of exercise , we can all start to understand why cancer is on the increase .\nWhilst middle aged married men must be made aware of ALL OF the risks and be empowered to change the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention .\nAs ever the first step to recovery is to look within .\nAnd so first , let \u2019 s briefly cover one of the most sensitive areas of all .\nThe prostrate .\nWhy in fact , do we see that ageing married men are the highest group at risk from Prostate cancer ?\nJust like every other organ in the human body the prostate has an essential role to play and specific job to do .\nIn medical school they used to be taught the phrase \u201c if you don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will lose it.\n\u201d The prostrate is a working organ .\nIt \u2019 s a functioning factory that produces an essential fluid , the very fluid that contains the DNA to starting new life , otherwise known as semen .\nBut just like any other fluid , without an outlet , we start to see problems .\nAs life and movement drains away , when water stops flowing , it becomes toxic , with nowhere to go it becomes stagnant and blockages can naturally occur .\nThis excess of fluid builds up inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prostrate requires a regular milking .\nOtherwise known as sex , or masturbation , this is a necessary physical function that cleans out the system .\nIt \u2019 s an out with the old and in with the new type system that allows new healthier sperm the space to grow and be stored , ready for the next round of fun .\nMasturbation should in fact be seen as an essential process , to keeping this system clean and healthy .\nSocial taboos aside , the prostrate is unaware of the stigma it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly producing the fluid of life throughout the life cycle of every living male .\nIt doesn \u2019 t matter if you are 17 , or 70 , it \u2019 s business as usual for the prostate .\nIf men can see masturbation as a part of a cleaning process , then maybe we can have a heathier understanding of this most misunderstood of sensitive areas .\nWhilst everything is in moderation , it \u2019 s certainly worth a try to improve the scan results !\nThe build-up in the prostate is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhen we see abnormal cells develop , they can become cancerous through the mutation process and so tumours form around these bad cells .\nSo let \u2019 s keep the fluids flowing and see masturbation not as a dirty thing , but actually a necessity and way of cleaning the system .\nA way of preventing unwelcome tumours from growing and developing .\nNow , back to the Immune System\u2026 Talking of stigmas , cancer is up there with sharks and spiders and the killer vid as the most feared and therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with the end of life , a deadly killer we can not control .\nYet , if you look at it closer , we are in fact all survivors of cancer .\nConstantly .\nCancer is in fact in us all and is even part of the natural processes of the immune system .\nTumours in a healthy immune system are formed and quickly broken down , as part of the clearance operation of the daily functions of a healthy person , who may , or may not even be aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutate constantly ( around 30 million times a day ) whilst we are also under attack from toxins in the processes foods we eat .\nThe immune system is on the constant look out for rogue cells and invaders , containing them and breaking them down .\nConstantly .\nSo , to try to understand the immune system , lets look at the main characters , the heroes and the villains of the hidden system , we are totally reliant on for survival .\nPlease see here for a full description of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really happens under the viewing microscope First , let \u2019 s meet the hero .\nMacrophages are the warriors , the foot soldiers of the immune system .\nThey are bigger than most cells and have an array of powers to seek and destroy invaders , cancer cells and clear debris within the immune system .\nThey are by far the most effective weapon we have against cancer .\nTo preserve their energy , they have 2 states .\nA look out patrol state , where they roam the immune system , ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more active state ) where they then go on the attack targeting and destroying enemy cells .\nBut like all good soldiers they will only attack and destroy the enemy when they know it is a real threat to the system it is employed to protect .\nThey will not attack normal healthy cells .\nSo , let \u2019 s return to the two villains in question and ask how did they manage to avoid the hunter instincts of the roaming Macrophages ?\nCancer cells \u2013 Firstly , these are of course the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real fallen angels of the immune system .\nThrough the mutation process , things go wrong and as we have described in the prostate build up and blockages can occur .\nHere cells can stop playing by the rules , they start acting very differently to normal cells and so can begin to grow and develop their own life forms .\nLike naughty children , they must be reprimanded and removed from class by the Macrophages , before they interrupt everyone and ruin the lesson .\nSo why do the Macrophages let such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twist that is the sting in the tail of cancerous cells , they produce an inhibitor known as Nagalase .\nNagalase \u2013 is the third character in our plot that really does have the power and knowledge to overcome the entire school and get it closed for good .\nPut in its simplest terms , the Nagalase is a kind of invisibility blanket that tricks the Macrophages into thinking the tumor of cancerous cells is just a bunch of normal cells that must be left in peace .\nIt is the sheeps clothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unabated and out of sight of the roaming Macrophage cells .\nThis is where immunotherapy comes in .\nWith out-of-control undetected tumors , the system needs something to change the current state of play and go into red alert .\nSomething is needed that can sound the alarm and alert the Macrophage fighter cells to the hidden dangers .\nWe need something to remove the smoke screen , turn on the search lights and alert the guards .\nImmunotherapy is therefore awakening the Macrophages slumber .\nAlerting them to the very real hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on their watch and under their very noses .\nBy activating the macrophages into attack and destroy mode , so we see the tumors targeted and cleared away .\nThis is what we refer to as the process of Immunotherapy treatment .\nAn already existing naturally occurring part of the immune system , GcMAF/VDTP is the natural alert system that changes the Macrophages into super killer cells that can get the job done .\nGcMAF ( Protein Macrophage Activating Factor ) , or Vitamin D Transport Protein ( VDTP ) as Vitamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system to turn your immune system back on full alert .\nBy administering GcMAF/VDTP we therefore sound the alarm , telling the Macrophages to take up arms and defeat the cancer cells , before they take over .\nPlease see this video for a description of the above process , to see how GcMAF/VDTP really can make all the difference to alert your army of soldiers to attack and destroy cancer .\nIf you are having problems sourcing a genuine product , here is one link where you can source VDPT/GcMaf The immune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves the best chance of fending off cancer , by taking care of this area of our inner world .\nImmunotherapy provides the tools and weapons for the battle , but we can treat ourselves better if we take care of our bodies and eat a healthy diet .\nPlease see here for the list of foods that you can eat to help you treat yourself , to strengthen your immune system and give your foot soldiers the best armour and intelligence to win the war for you .\nGc protein carries one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sialic acid termini at 420 threonine residues .\nThis oligosaccharide is hydrolyzed by the inducible membranous \u03b2-galactosidase of inflammation-primed B lymphocytes to yield a macrophage-activating factor .\nThis is further hydrolyzed by the membranous Neu-1 sialidase of T lymphocytes to yield MAF , the protein with N-acetylgalactosamine as the remaining sugar .\nDeglycosylated Gc protein is non-convertible to MAF , resulting in no macrophage activation .\nMacrophages are phagocytic and antigen-presenting cells .\nBecause macrophage activation for phagocytosis and antigen presentation is an indispensable step in the development of humoral and cellular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads to immunosuppression .\nAdvanced cancer patients have high serum Nagalase activities , resulting in no macrophage activation and severe immunosuppression , which is why cancer patients die from infection [ 6 ] .\nStepwise treatment of purified Gc protein with immobilized \u03b2-galactosidase and sialidase generates VDTP/GcMAF , which produces no adverse effects in humans .\nAdministration of 100 ng of VDTP/GcMAF results in activation of macrophages with a 30-fold increased ingestion index and 15-fold increased superoxide-generating capacity [ 7 ] .\nVDTP/GcMAF has a potent mitogenic capacity to act on the myeloid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase in systemic macrophage cell counts [ 8 ] .\nThese macrophages are chemotactically engaged in inflamed lesions by a 180-fold increase in macrophage cell counts [ 9 ] .\nMacrophages develop a variety of receptors that recognize abnormalities in cancerous cell surfaces and kill cancerous cells .\nThe malignant cells have membrane abnormalities on their cell surface .\nA series of glycoprotein , glycolipid , and mucin antigens are identified and designated as tumour-based antigens on the cell surface of various human tumour cells .\nVDTP/GcMAF therapy as a single remedy modality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancers most effectively .\nAlthough prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) is used as a diagnostic and prognostic index for prostate cancer , a more precision prognostic index is desirable for the therapeutic efficacy of VDTP/GcMAF for prostate cancer patients .\nSerum Nagalase activity has been effectively used as a diagnostic index for cancers and a prognostic index for radiation therapy , surgical resection of tumours , and VDTP/GcMAF therapy for preclinical and clinical mammary adenocarcinoma models and colorectal cancers .\nA group of nonanemic prostate cancer patients were administered 100 ng of VDTP/GcMAF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( > 2 ml ) were weekly or biweekly collected before each dose administration and were used for prognostic analysis .\nDetailed assessment of patient response to each VDTP/GcMAF administration was performed by determining both MAF precursor activity of serum Gc protein and serum Nagalase activity .\nSince serum Nagalase activity is proportional to tumour burden , a kinetic assessment of curative response to VDTP/GcMAF therapy was performed with serum Nagalase activity as a prognostic index during the whole process .\nThe MAF Precursor Activity of Serum Nagalase & Gc Protein Activity as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During VDTP/GcMAF therapy , MAF precursor and serum Nagalase activity were closely analyzed .\nWith the progression of the therapy , the MAF precursor activity increased , and their serum Nagalase activity decreased inversely .\nWhen MAF precursor activity increased toward healthy control value , serum Nagalase activities in vitro study decreased to healthy control level .\nThus , these malignancy parameters of prostate cancer patients served as excellent prognostic indices .\nBecause the serum Nagalase is proportional to tumour burden [ 10 ] , as VDTP/GcMAF therapy progressed , serum Nagalase activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decreased .\nCurative Rate of VDTP/GcMAF Therapy for Prostate Cancer Depends on the Degree of Cell Surface Abnormality Poorly differentiated cancer cells have more abnormality in the cell surface than moderately/immediate differentiated cancer cells [ 11 ] .\nSince the activated macrophages efficiently recognize and rapidly kill cancer cells , the activated macrophages kill undifferentiated cells more quickly than differentiated cells .\nThus , the rapid decrease in serum Nagalase activities during VDTP/GcMAF therapy implies more abnormality in undifferentiated cells .\nCorrelation between Serum Nagalase Activity and PSA Levels during VDTP/GcMAF Therapy Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for estimating tumour burden , serum PSA levels were compared with serum Nagalase activity during VDTP/GcMAF therapy .\nIn patients without tumour resection , serum Nagalase activity decreased as VDTP/GcMAF therapy progressed , and their PSA values remained unchanged .\nThe result suggests that the PSA derived from tumour-bearing prostate did not change while tumour burden decreased .\nSince tumour-induced inflammation causes secretion of PSA , the PSA produced herein can not be altered by a decrease in tumour burden .\nProstatic cancer diagnosis and prognosis have advanced with the availability of PSA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that PSA is predominantly produced from tumour lesions in the prostate compared with metastasized lesions .\nThe serum Nagalase decreased during VDTP/GcMAF therapy for patients suffering from tumour-bearing prostate , and PSA stayed unaffected .\nTherefore , PSA values can \u2019 t be used for prognostic assays during VDTP/GcMAF therapy .\nProstate-specific antigen can be considered specific to prostatic malignancy .\nIt is an extracellular matrix-degrading enzyme that is required for the invasiveness of cancerous tissues [ 13 ] .\nNormal prostatic inflamed tissues release PSA , like benign prostate hypertrophy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitro study confirms that the PSA assay can not accurately estimate the fractional loss of tumour burden due to the predominance of PSA production in prostatic tissues .\nExtraprostatic tissues produce prostate-specific antigens , including clonogenic glandular epithelium , salivary gland neoplasm , and normal and cancerous female breast tissues [ 14 ] .\nThus , PSA is less specific to prostatic malignancy .\nAs far as Nagalase is concerned , it is exclusively secreted from cancerous cells but not from normal tissues .\nThus , the level of Nagalase activity in blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis is a prognostic index for VDTP/GcMAF therapy for preclinical and clinical cancer models .\nThe measurements of serum Nagalase activity and MAF precursor activity of serum Gc protein allow envisioning the degree of immunosuppression and disease state .\nWhen VDTP/GcMAF ( 100 ng ) is administered to cancer patients , there is barely any effect on VDTP/GcMAF ; it bypasses the deglycosylated Gc protein and directly acts on macrophages for extensive activation .\nSuch highly activated macrophages develop a considerable variation of receptors to recognize the abnormality of the malignant cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of macrophages to realise the exception of malignant cells is fundamental and universal to every type of cancer ; so far , tested ones are breast , prostate , stomach , colon , liver , lung , kidney , bladder , uterus , ovary , head/neck , melanoma , and fibrosarcoma .\nProgress of VDTP/GcMAF therapy for cancer is monitored by the measurement of malignant cell-specific serum Nagalase activity found universally in cancer patients .\nCurative rates of various cancers depend on the degree of cell surface abnormality corresponding to the malignant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measurement of Nagalase activity allowed the determination of the degree of cell surface abnormality by the curative rate during VDTP/GcMAF therapy .\nDue to the precision measurement of serum Nagalase , the curative rate measurements of tumours during VDTP/GcMAF therapy and estimation of the degree of tumour differentiation are now possible .\nTherefore , the significance of VDTP/GcMAF therapy for cancers has been dramatically enhanced by the discovery of cancer cell-specific Nagalase that can accurately monitor the rate of tumour regression during VDTP/GcMAF therapy .\nThere are many substantial reasons why cancer patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not underestimate the power of immunotherapy and understand why and how immunotherapy works in the human body !\nNeed a better guide to

is one element that has attracted controversies at the forefront of many medical & recreational debates across the world , side-lining the benefits it offers .\nMedical marijuana , or cannabis , treats many ailments such as epilepsy , glaucoma , arthritis , and even cancer .\nApparently , some new studies suggest it \u2019 s efficient in treating Crohn \u2019 s disease .\nAccording to a study

cardiologists tracking cardiac arrhythmia or irregular beats have consistently noted more stressors among young people over the years .\nSome studies suggest that South Asians are more prone to heart

exercise that might be harmful rather than protective .\nVigorous exertion may transiently increase the risk of acute cardiac events [ 7 ] .\nSo , one might not be medically healthy , given the underlying cardiac disease .\nBut how to help ?\nTake Note of the Silent Triggers ?\nThere are probabilities of genetic arrhythmic [ 8 ] in the family , a spontaneous genetic variation , a thickened heart muscle ( hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ) and rhythmic disorders .\nThese may not appear early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them .\nFor example , the most known cause of sudden cardiac death in young people is a genetic condition that causes the heart muscle to grow thick .\nThis increases the difficulty for the heart to pump blood and accelerate heartbeats during a fast-paced exercise .\nThis becomes the reason for cardiac collapse owing to faulty electrical signalling in the heart .\nA fast-paced heart causes the lower heart chambers ( ventricles ) to tremble instead of pumping blood .\nThis irregular heart rhythm , ventricular fibrillation , is responsible for building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syndrome [ 9 , 10 ] is a heart rhythm condition that causes chaotic & fast heartbeats .\nIt is often linked to unexplained fainting and death in young people .\nCardiologists also see excessive use of protein and muscle-enhancing supplements by youngsters at the gym as red flags .\nDoctors fear such arbitrary use as they could be packed with steroids and interfere with heart functioning , especially during work-out .\nAn unexpected cardiac arrest can lead to sudden death if the patient fails to receive immediate revival ( within the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack ) .\nAn adult human heart beats 60-100 beats/minute , and any fluctuation in this rate , either too slow or too fast , is known as cardiac arrhythmia .\nSo , any increase in heart rate is fatal , so keep an eye on it .\nHow Do We Prevent Cardiac Episodes ?\nWhen Do I Get Tested ?\nWe care about our readers and have come up with some basic things you can keep track of to keep your heart healthy !\n1 ) When hitting the age bar of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profile screening , diabetes , liver and kidney function , with an ECG on a regular note .\nSince metabolic issues show up among most South-Asians , it is vital to keep a check .\n2 ) For those actively engaged in workouts and gym activities , ensure you reach a doctor before the trainer .\nHaving a prophylactic check-up and cardiac evaluation for silent problems can be helpful .\nMake sure you push down strenuous exercises and work within your body limits .\n3 ) Avoid consuming protein supplements without a proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how they target your body .\n4 ) Beyond 40 , take an annual stress test to check on any underlying disease-causing stress to your heart .\nThis can help in the early diagnosis of any abnormality , even if any blood test or echocardiogram misses it .\n5 ) Do not run away from the Treadmill Test ( TMT ) , as it is conducted under controlled circumstances and is intended to identify the problem that triggers your heart stress .\n6 ) Every young individual above 20 years must get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lipid profile and an exercise stress test .\n7 ) Annual exercise test is a must for smokers , diabetics , obese and those at risk .\nIt is also recommended to have a cardiac check-up before signing up for running activities or marathons .\nWhat Else it takes to Live with a Healthy Heart ?\nA Pause of Smoking : Smoking is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease , including coronary heart disease and hypertension .\nCompared with non-smokers , smokers have a 1.6-fold greater risk of developing myocardial infarction and a 23 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Studies prove that in a person who has no history of cardiovascular disease , smoking cessation reduces mortality from cardiovascular disease by about 2-35 per cent [ 11 ] , which is similar to the effect of antihypertensive treatment .\nFor those who have heart

high cholesterol levels can help prevent heart attacks and strokes , increasing the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifestyle .\nOmega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids can be found in fish , nuts and seeds , which are beneficial to the heart because the body can not produce them .\nThe consumption of unhealthy diets , including fast food , increases the risk of hypercholesterolemia , hypertension and diabetes .\nThis can damage the heart and make it more likely to develop heart disease .\nTo keep your heart healthy , you should have a diet low in saturated fats and salt but plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables .\nFind here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !\nEnvironmental Factors : The development of the foetus is influenced by a polluted environment during pregnancy and can ultimately lead to congenital heart disease .\nAlthough evidence supporting this theory is limited , recent studies suggest that air pollution may also play a role in causing congenital anomalies , particularly genetic heart diseases

"Many people find themselves researching the foods , herbs , vitamins and minerals that affect their health .\nIf you \u2019 re someone who is very concerned about your own genetics\u2014for example , if the family history includes anything from cancer to diabetes to high cholesterol levels .\nSince many of these problems came about because of poor personal habits , environmental factors and food choices [ 1 ] , it is important to stay mindful of my own health by eating well and exercising when possible .\nLet \u2019 s explore the benefits of eating foods that can improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foods to avoid .\nThrough blood circulation , blood moves through our bodies .\nIt is a complex system involving many different organs and tissues .\nThe body \u2019 s blood vessels constantly feed oxygen and nutrients to the heart , lungs , brain , muscles , kidneys and other cells in the body .\nProper blood circulation is important for maintaining a healthy lifestyle [ 2 ] because it helps deliver nutrients to our cells and remove waste products .\nThis helps us feel more energized throughout the day and also avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or diabetes .\nThere are three main parts to proper blood circulation : arteries , veins and capillaries .\nAn artery [ 3 ] is part of an organ such as your heart or your brain ; it carries oxygenated blood away from these organs to the rest of your body via smaller arteries called veins [ 4 ] which are found elsewhere in your body , such as your arms or legs where they carry deoxygenated ( oxygen poor ) blood back towards those same organs again via larger veins known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely thin walls allowing very little space between them .\nHence there isn \u2019 t much room for anything else .\nThe body \u2019 s circulatory system transports oxygen , nutrients and other substances from the heart and lungs to cells throughout the body by means of arteries , while removing waste products through veins .\nIf any area of whole circulatory system is impaired , you could experience symptoms such as : Swelling in the feet , ankles , or legs Tingling & numbness in the hands and feet You can promote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetables , drinking more water , and exercising regularly .\nHere are ten foods that may help improve blood circulation and have a better flow .\nGarlic is more than just an incredible seasoning .\nIt can also help protect your body against disease while lowering your blood pressure .\nScientists have discovered that garlic contains a compound called allicin , which can cause the muscles of your heart and

that garlic makes virtually any dish better ?\nDig in to learn some more benefits !\n[ 6 , 7 ] Although many people think capsaicin makes a cayenne pepper hot , it is a vasodilator that helps lower blood pressure and expands blood vessels due to its nitric oxide .\nAdditionally , it can prevent plaque build-up in arteries .\n[ 8 ] In ancient times , turmeric was used in Chinese medicine .\nScientists have found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood vessels .\nCurcumin , the active ingredient in turmeric , also helps increase nitric oxide production , reduce oxidative stress , and decrease inflammation

!\nCitrus fruits like oranges , lemons and grapefruit contain antioxidants and flavonoids .\nConsuming such flavonoid-rich fruits may decrease inflammation in your body , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nitric oxide production .\nIn recent years , flavonoids can even help with varicose veins , reduce the risk of stroke , and improve cognitive functions [ 13 ] .\nFatty fish , such as salmon , mackerel , tuna , trout , sardines and herring , contain high omega-3 fatty acids .\nThese fats\u2014also known as n-3 fatty acids\u2014release nitric oxide into your body , dilating your blood vessels and increasing

encouraging results : An 80 % survival rate ( about twice the historical rate of 30-40 % ) and 70 % of patients experiencing a favourable outcome ( far higher than the historical rate of less than 10 % ) .\nHundreds of laboratory studies have documented the pharmacological actions [ 2 ] and efficacy of DMSO .\nDMSO yields promising results in treating the following conditions : Alzheimer \u2019 s disease : It dissolves amyloids and invariably leads to the functional loss and eventual death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value in reducing pain and inflammation in osteoarthritis , rheumatoid arthritis , and possibly gout .\nDMSO has been shown to retard the development of atherosclerosis in mice and can reduce cholesterol levels in animals when fed a high-cholesterol diet .\nA study by Stephen B. Strum , MD , showed that applying DMSO reduced the damaging effects of anthracycline drugs exuding into surrounding tissues .\nFibromyalgia : When treated with DMSO , fibromyalgia patients experienced benefits with no side effects .\nThis is due to pharmacological actions of DMSO such as free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softening scar tissue , and healing stimulation .\nHerpes : Researchers have found that using DMSO to enhance the penetration of alpha-interferon ointment in treating herpes helps reduce pain .\nInterstitial cystitis : The FDA-approved palliative treatment for this chronic inflammatory condition is the instillation of DMSO in the urinary bladder .\nMalignancy : Studies concluded DMSO is responsible for exerting a significant survival advantage in gastric cancer .\nProstatitis : When DMSO was injected into the prostatic urethra , significant symptomatic relief occurred .\nReflex sympathetic dystrophy : DMSO helps relieve pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous system disorder causes pain and the extremities .\nIn some countries like Holland , a physician is breaking the law if he does not prescribe topical DMSO for reflex sympathetic dystrophy .\nScleroderma : Researchers recently discovered that topical application of a dimethyl sulfoxide solution produced anti-inflammatory effects while increasing blood flow to the skin .\nSpinal cord injury : A recent study shows that administering DMSO within the first 45-60 minutes after injury results in a much higher recovery rate than those not receiving DMSO .\nThis is an area for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are fewer patients with severe spinal cord injuries in long-term care facilities than in hospital settings .\nUlcerative colitis : Some studies found that orally administered DMSO has been shown to improve the condition of some patients .\nEarly studies showed proven results on how DMSO rapidly penetrates the skin and quickly relieves inflammation & pain associated with injuries .\nDimethyl sulfoxide , an inexpensive compound primarily ignored by the medical community , holds great promise in treating various health conditions .\nOriginally discovered as a by-product of paper manufacturing , DMSO has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is most promising for treating severe closed head trauma , relieving brain swelling and restoring blood flow in the post-injury phase .\nResearch suggests further applications of DMSO to fight diseases like arthritis , fibromyalgia and ulcerative colitis [ 4 ] .\nThe FDA halted all studies of DMSO in 1965 despite data in hand from the US that proved its safety and effectiveness .\nCritics contend that the agency overreacted , considering how unconcerned it appears today with deaths from both trials and approved pharmaceuticals .\nThe role of DMSO in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of controversy , during which people doubted the compound \u2019 s safety .\nIt was considered a snake-oil medicine for decades ; it sounded too good to be true .\nSince DMSO was knocked off track , it had been a battle for researchers to get FDA approval of DMSO for any use .\nIn the early 1970s , pressure on the FDA led to the commissioning of an external review of DMSO by the National Academy of Sciences .\nThe NAS published many findings in 1972 and concluded that DMSO was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective agent .\nThis did not impress the FDA ; however , it was a minor success as the agency approved DMSO to treat interstitial cystitis in 1978 .\nAn obstacle to DMSO \u2019 s widespread d use is drug companies \u2019 lack of potential profitability .\nThere is more need for medical literature that comes up with more scientific evidence about or referring to DMSO over penicillin , cortisone , or aspirin .\nDMSO has immense potential and can be mixed with other substances [ 5 ] .\nDespite its long and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite favourably as a future of medicine and treatments , as more evidence of its safety and efficacy accumulates\u2014particularly as new investigations explore its use in treating

"title": "ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS: FAT STORAGE & DIABETES!", "content": "Aspartame is one of the common ingredients found in artificial sweeteners on the market .\nIt is also one of the worst products in this category .\nAspartame has been shown to cause weight gain and other health problems , including headaches and dizziness .\nThere are also two others : aminoguanidine and sucralose , typically used by people with diabetes and those concerned about their weight .\nThis is happening , although artificial sweeteners have been proven to produce the exact opposite effects that it claims !\nResearch [ 1 ] shows that aspartame worsens insulin sensitivity significantly more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proven to promote weight gain in many different ways stated in additional studies [ 2 ] .\nArtificial sweeteners have recently crawled into various products , indirectly targeting diabetics and dieters .\nThe rising demand for artificial sweeteners in the food industry has pushed the food industry to hide the presence of these additives on labels .\nLike genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) , this tactic is designed to keep consumers unsure about what they are eating and thus persuade them to continue buying products containing non-natural ingredients .\nArtificial sweeteners do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the calories needed to trick the brain into thinking that you have eaten something sweet .\nWhen you consume something sweet , your brain releases dopamine , which activates your brain \u2019 s reward centre .\nThe appetite-regulating hormone leptin is also released , making it clear to your brain that you are \u201c full \u201d once a certain number of calories have been ingested .\nBut when you eat something that tastes sweet but doesn \u2019 t contain any calories , your brain \u2019 s pleasure pathway gets activated by the sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deactivate since the calories never arrive [ 3 ] .\nArtificial sweeteners trick the human body into thinking it will receive sugar ( calories ) .\nStill , when the sugar isn \u2019 t received , the body continues to signal that it needs more .\nBesides complicating insulin sensitivity and promoting weight gain , other artificial sweeteners and aspartame also promote other health problems related to excessive sugar consumption , including cardiovascular disease and strokes [ 4 ] .\nAnother health issue it invites is Alzheimer \u2019 s disease [ 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of Alzheimer \u2019 s disease are sugar and grains , which affect a person \u2019 s diet .\nHowever , methanol toxicity\u2013a much-ignored problem associated with aspartame in particular\u2013is another factor contributing to this disease \u2019 s development .\nIn many contexts , experts explain the links between aspartame and methanol toxicity and the formation of toxic formaldehyde [ 6 ] .\nQuite shockingly , the industry claims are the opposite of what is claimed .\nMany studies have shown that artificial sweeteners increase cravings for carbs , stimulate appetite , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boost fat storage and weight gain , which proves that you are being marketed for a farce product having unreal claims .\nMillions of studies refute the fact that the beverage industry promotes that diet soda aids weight loss .\nIn reality , weight gain and changes in appetite are the most common issues faced with long-term aspartame consumption .\nEating processed and fast foods may kill more prematurely [ 7 ] than other chronic diseases like cancer .\nSimilarly , we have more dangerous items that we consume in our daily lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Read here how terrible it is for you and has nothing to do with weight loss !\nStudies show that drinking diet soda increases the likelihood of serious weight gain .\nOn average , for each diet soda consumed per day , participants were 65 per cent likely to become overweight during the next 7-8 years and 41 per cent more likely to become obese .\nThere are studies [ 8 ] that delve into the neurobiology of those commonly known sugar cravings and the epidemiological & experimental evidence concerning the effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sweeteners and the harm they cause : Specific mechanisms are artificial sweeteners , which pack the person with unwanted pounds and disrupt your metabolic function .\nSuch studies prove causation that is much required for artificial sweeteners .\nIn the past few years , the role of gut microbes has increasingly been uncovered , and its role in human health is significant .\nCertain gut microbes have been found to have been linked with obesity ; for instance , it turns out that artificial sweeteners disrupt your intestinal microflora- thereby raising your risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Artificial Sweeteners are found that artificial sweeteners alter metabolic pathways associated with metabolic disease [ 9 ] .\n\u2022 Artificial Sweeteners are responsible for a decreased function observed in pathways associated with sugar transport in the body [ 10 ] .\n\u2022 Of all artificial sweeteners tested , saccharin is the strongest on impact , followed by sucralose and aspartame [ 12 ] .\n\u2022 Glucose intolerance , a general condition for type 2 diabetes patients , also plays a role in obesity because excess sugar in the blood is stored in fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Out ?\nWhen you add together the various methods of harm\u2014from confusing your body with a sweet taste without calories to altering the gut bacteria , it is quite easy to understand how artificial sweeteners have played a role in worsening diabetes and obesity epidemics since their emergence in our food supply .\nAvoiding all artificial sweeteners is strongly recommended , and read food labels to ensure you \u2019 re not inadvertently consuming them .\nIt is estimated that these products are found in 6,000 different beverages , snacks , and food products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone to avoid them altogether .\nYou could use stevia or Luo Han as a sweetener , both of which are safe , natural alternatives .\nHowever , if you have any of the following conditions , it may be wise to avoid all types of sweeteners : high blood pressure , high cholesterol , diabetes or extra weight .\nUnfortunately , like sugar , artificial sweeteners can cause you to become addicted to them .\nIf you have trouble quitting diet soda , it is hard for you to overcome the desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are determined to quit soda , there are plenty of ways .\nIf you have tried other methods and failed , Turbo Tapping may be just what you need .\nThis version of the Emotional Freedom Technique ( EFT ) [ 13 ] is geared explicitly toward combatting sugar cravings .\nFor instructions on how to use EFT to fight food cravings of all kinds , you can track down some information from the web on \u201c how to get rid of the soda addiction \u201d .\nIf you still struggle with cravings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may need to make further changes to your diet .\nYou can choose to go on a fruitarian diet , where you can include a moderate inclusion of vegetables , nuts , dried fruits , and seeds .\nOther food sources , such as legumes , grains , and meat , are limited or eliminated .\nIf you are impressed by a fruitarian diet , find here more details and proceed slowly .\nRather than starting all at once , make a wise choice and gradually make a transition .\nYou must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consume in packaged food .\nFind some food contents that can harm you in different ways .\nCertain foods can trigger pain and inflammation ; find the list here and avoid them !\nDiet plays a significant role in how we conduct our body and steering the journey to a healthy life .\nDo you know that there is a list of food that can fight and kill cancer stem cells
