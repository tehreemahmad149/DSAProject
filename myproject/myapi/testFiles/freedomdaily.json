"content": "God-fearing people sometimes feel lost , as if no prayer they provide gets them an answer .\nAnd while they are afraid that the Lord is ignoring them , nothing can be further from the truth .\nGod listens to all prayers , and he does answer \u2014 in His own way .\nIn this article , you will learn of 6 signs of God speaking to you and how to read and respond to them .\nWhy Does God Speak to You ?\n1 .\nHe Wants to Reveal His Purpose The Lord has a purpose in mind \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth don \u2019 t comprehend fully .\nAnd in order to fulfill that purpose , He reveals it to humans precisely when it \u2019 s necessary .\nTake the case of Abraham .\nWhen God spoke to him , He did so with the purpose of building a great nation .\nHe did so in order to prepare Abraham for the future and the hardships he was to endure .\nBut He also did so to prepare the groundwork for creating the Hebrew nation , one that still goes strong today .\nSo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He also intends to reveal His purpose , or at least the part of His purpose that involves you .\nAnd it is therefore instructive to listen , for in fulfilling His purpose , you also fulfill your own .\nIt is a complementary relationship that works to the spiritual benefit of both you and the Lord Himself .\nAs stated earlier , the grand purpose of God involves His children , all of them .\nAnd that very much includes both you and us .\nWhen we do His work , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes from task fulfillment .\nNoah is the perfect example of that .\nWhen God needed to cleanse the Earth , he instructed Noah to build an Arc and to save himself , his family , and the Earth \u2019 s animals .\nIt was a daunting task , and Noah did the work because the Lord instructed him to .\nBut he also did it because it was the right thing to do , and the result was the salvation of his family .\nAnd , consequently , the salvation of Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the Lord seeks your help with something , He does so for several reasons , some of which we mentioned earlier .\nAnother key reason is to test your faith .\nA true believer will know how to recognize God \u2019 s intent and will help Him see it through .\nAnd indeed , the test might be incredibly difficult , as it was for Noah and Abraham .\nOf course , if you do it knowing you \u2019 re helping God achieve His purpose , you \u2019 re going to pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordeal stronger than ever .\nPlus , your faith in Him will increase , and the bond you share will harden all the more .\n3 .\nHe Wants You to Feel Closer to Him There are times , indeed quite frequently , when your connection with God goes cold .\nIt might not be your fault , of course .\nLife just seemed to be throwing one curveball after another at you .\nAnd somewhere along your life path , you strayed from God or simply neglected Him a bit .\nSo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wants to rekindle that bond \u2014 the one He shares with all of his children .\nHe is genuinely asking you to let Him be a part of His life once again .\nFor though He may appear cold and unresponsive , He \u2019 s anything but .\nAfter all , His love for His children is immense and everlasting , and even if you can \u2019 t hear Him , He \u2019 s there watching over you and guiding you .\nCommunicating with God is , therefore , key if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while .\nAnd sometimes , even a regular conversation may be enough .\nJust let Him know how your day went , how you feel , and how grateful you are for His grace .\nAfter all , He has created the world wherein you live through both good moments and bad , where you progress and where you love .\nThat one simple conversation will be a spark that gets you back on the right path , the spark that brings God back into your heart .\nOf course , God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you when you \u2019 ve strayed from the path .\nThere are plenty of times when His Holy image will appear before you after you \u2019 ve done something incredible or praiseworthy .\nThat \u2019 s Him directly telling you how proud He is of you and your achievements .\nIndeed , there is no greater encouragement than that which comes from the Lord .\nA lot of men and women across the globe have talents that they don \u2019 t use .\nWorse yet , they squander them or use them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God talks to them too , for they are His children as much as all others .\nBut the people who use their God-given gifts for good causes will ultimately hear His word of praise .\nAnd at that moment , they will know they are on the right path .\nNaturally , there \u2019 s a difference between God \u2019 s honest encouragement and Satan \u2019 s sweet words of nothing .\nUnlike God , the Lord of Lies will encourage behavior that might seem beneficial to you but is actually toxic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to differentiate the word of God from the word of the Unclean One .\nThe sooner you do that , the closer you will feel to Him , and more of His praise will come your way .\nGod \u2019 s encouragement , as beautiful as it is , can also be immensely useful .\nBy doing right by God , you will get the motivation to progress , and that will result in you spreading His word through your actions and successes .\nOthers will feel inspired by you , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of a million , you \u2019 re in God \u2019 s good graces and as far away from the Evil One as possible .\n5 .\nHis Word Pulls You Up When You \u2019 re Down Finally , the word of God will appear before you when you feel downtrodden and hopeless .\nIn fact , that \u2019 s when God \u2019 s voice is the most powerful , for it boosts the human spirit and helps the person pull themselves out of the direst of straits .\nIt \u2019 s a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need only look at the Book of Job as confirmation of God \u2019 s infinite grace .\nWhen Job lost everything he had earned throughout his life , he was tempted to scorn God , whom he had praised and prayed to for decades .\nAnd while Job did have some moments of weakness , as all humans do , ultimately , he stuck to his faith .\nAnd God indeed heard his prayers and felt the wounds Job felt .\nThus , the good man \u2019 s fortune was restored .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling crushed by life , unable to move forward , you \u2019 ll know that God is the only answer and that He will contact you eventually .\nAnd no issue is too big or small for His advice , be it losing your home or getting fired or being mired in massive debt , or even having a terminal disease .\nOne conversation with God , and you will already have more than enough energy to try and pick yourself back up .\nYou will join the ranks of millions of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destruction and damnation .\n6 Signs of God Speaking to You Lots of children of God tend to forget that whether they speak to Him or not , God has already shared His Word with them .\nThat Word , i.e.\n, the Holy Bible , is deserving of its capital W. For it is in this sacred tome that you can find God speaking to you , with a solution to whatever problem ails you .\nLet \u2019 s use a hypothetical example .\nYou feel unhappy and unfulfilled , and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They almost blend into one another .\nYou barely manage to get out of your bed , and each step you take feels as if your feet were encased in lead .\nAnd as sinful as it may be , there \u2019 s a thought in your head that it might be the time to just end it all , quietly , so nobody notices that you \u2019 re gone .\nBut as depressed and powerless as you might be , you can \u2019 t seem to get the verses from the Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and day out , they pop into your head .\nNot too often , of course , but at just the right time , in just the right amount .\nAnd it \u2019 s usually one or two verses that directly relate to happiness and how to obtain it .\nThat right there is not a coincidence , true believer .\nThat \u2019 s the will of God speaking to you through His written tome .\nThe Holy Bible , just by existing , has saved countless lives mainly because most of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and phrases .\nIt shows how much the Good Book means to us all and how respectful and logical God is when using it to communicate with us .\nReading scripture is a nurturing , necessary experience .\nHowever , it \u2019 s far from being the only way God speaks to His subjects .\nSometimes , the Lord himself will let His voice be heard and converse with the people living on Earth .\nAnd we repeat \u2014 he will let His voice be heard .\nThere are , naturally , cynical-minded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God talking to us as superstition or even lunacy .\nAnd sadly , a lot of people with mental issues tend to \u2018 hear God \u2019 when in reality , it \u2019 s their mind playing cruel tricks on them .\nSome people might go even further and ask , \u2018 what kind of selfish God lets people with health issues commit atrocities in His name ?\n\u2019 Indeed , that is a fair question ; a layperson might assume that God simply allows these tragedies to happen .\nBut again , true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , violence , or murder in His name .\nIf anything , they will be the first people in line to say outright that God did not communicate with these individuals in need of psychiatric help .\nAnd indeed , God did talk to some of these good people , audibly and not via scripture .\nMuch like the verses from the Bible , the voice of God comes unannounced when we least expect it but need it the most .\nTherefore , it pays to have ears ready and wait for God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears the next time .\nThere are millions of God-fearing men and women , so it should not surprise you that some of them want to give you advice .\nSometimes , it \u2019 s out of fear , and other times it \u2019 s admiration or general interest and care .\nWhatever the reason , these men and women often offer counsel to those in need .\nInterestingly enough , advice from God might not manifest through the words of a fellow believer .\nYou can receive the Lord \u2019 s wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFor example , a devout Muslim , Buddhist , Shintoist , or even an atheist can give you sage advice on any number of topics .\nBut make no mistake , that is the word of God speaking through them .\nIt lets you know that He is everywhere and that all of His children have that spark of wisdom inside of them .\nOnce again , we should stress that not all advice may come from God .\nWhat \u2019 s more , you may run into someone who hands counsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes from a noble source .\nIt \u2019 s a heinous act from the Lord of Lies , and so you must recognize what advice is godly and what isn \u2019 t .\nExperience will teach you how to handle Satan .\nAnd as long as you steer clear of his lies , you \u2019 ll move one step closer to God .\nA good way of doing that is comparing the counsel to what the Bible says , and if there \u2019 s a match , the counsel you \u2019 re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had received God \u2019 s wisdom through dreams and visions .\nPeople like the Magi and the apostles Paul and John all received warnings and important news via these indirect means .\nA dream is a powerful tool of divination .\nMany cultures other than Judeo-Christian used them to read the Divine will .\nWhen you sleep , powerful images will assail your mind .\nThey will show you entire worlds different from your own , with messages that are not clear at first .\nHowever , the ones that will be clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If your dreams repeat themselves , that \u2019 s God speaking to you , letting you know that something is amiss .\nIgnoring these dreams is a mistake .\nIf you do so , you \u2019 re not letting God help you and explain what \u2019 s going on , effectively shutting Him out of your life .\nVisions offer similar effects to dreams , though they appear rarely and are usually more vivid .\nNearly all great prophets of Judaism and Christianity had visions of different people , objects , or events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the entire end of our earthly realm in Revelations .\nHe saw beasts and men fall to the pits of hell , angels next to God \u2019 s throne .\nMost famously , he saw the rejoicing that comes at the end of time .\nAnd no , it \u2019 s not uncommon for everyday Christians in 2022 to have a few divine visions .\nThere \u2019 s that feeling , in the very core of a man \u2019 s body , that lets them know something is a little off .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense mechanism , telling the person whether or not they should proceed .\nSometimes , the gut is loud and states , \u201c do it , go for it , don \u2019 t miss the opportunity !\n\u201d Other times , it will quietly say , \u201c walk away and leave it be , it \u2019 s not worth your time , and it is likely dangerous.\n\u201d The modern English language refers to that feeling as listening to one \u2019 s gut , as opposed to listening to one \u2019 s heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s God speaking directly through you , letting your body show you what you \u2019 re doing right or wrong .\nBy listening to your gut in these situations , you will reach a decision that will get you one step closer to Heaven .\nOf course , as is the case with counsel and dreams , the gut can also be stimulated by Satan .\nHe is quite powerful , and manipulating a human body to the wrong instincts is not beyond his capabilities .\nSo , what can you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instincts ?\nWell , simply refer to the Holy Bible and see what Jesus would do in that situation .\nIf it runs counter to what your gut is telling you , then it \u2019 s best to go with the Bible \u2019 s wise words .\nHumans have a will of their own , as bestowed upon them by God .\nThey can make any decisions they want , including bad ones .\nAfter all , as subservient as humans ought to be to the Lord , He made them be independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own .\nSo , as an individual who wants to grow and develop further , you will surely have goals of your own .\nAnd in order to achieve them , you will be going down certain paths .\nBut those paths might be blocked in one way or another .\nIf you aim to reach one goal , but the same type of failure keeps happening , that \u2019 s God warning you not to pursue it .\nOf course , you \u2019 re under no obligation to listen , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did .\nOne path in life is not worth maintaining if it goes counter to God \u2019 s teachings and your own well-being .\nGod , however , does not push you into anything directly .\nHe might close a few doors on your path moving forward .\nBut he \u2019 ll open a window or a small hatch for you to try and reach for further progress .\nWhat Do You Do When God Speaks to You ?\nIf God speaks to you at home and you \u2019 re not sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pen and some paper .\nThen begin writing anything that comes to mind at the moment .\nFor that \u2019 s the Lord slowly guiding you to share your entire life with Him .\nNow , it \u2019 s important that your writing isn \u2019 t formal or dry .\nLet it flow and relax your mind .\nYour letter to God should be friendly and warm , deeply familial , for he is your Father and Creator .\nWriting like that often will open up a whole new relationship with the Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursue it .\nWe stated earlier how a simple conversation with God could change anything .\nAnd this step is roughly the same as the previous one .\nWhen you feel like you \u2019 ve heard God \u2019 s voice , sit up , listen carefully , and start asking questions .\nThey can range between effective ones and downright useless ones .\nBut be patient and wait for God \u2019 s feedback .\nOnce you receive it , talk to the Lord some more , as it will strengthen your link to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief defense weapon against Satan in all his forms .\nAs a God-fearing person , when you hear His voice and see His message , put your hands together and get on your knees .\nThen recite your favorite prayers , focusing on what comes next .\nIt might be mid-prayer .\nIt might be once it \u2019 s long done .\nBut God will definitely speak to the person who prays diligently .\nShould you act after hearing the word of God and immediately go according to His plan ?\nIs the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see where it goes ?\nIn reality , both of these acts sound legit .\nAt times , the Lord might need you immediately , sharing a task that only you can pull off .\nBut at other times , the Lord needs you to think and only act once you \u2019 ve figured everything out .\nOnce you learn to recognize which is which , your faith in God will strengthen , and you \u2019 ll move through life with a lot more ease .", "author": "Jill Walker", "url": "https://freedomdaily.com/signs-of-god-speaking-to-you/",

you must sacrifice a pair of panties every time .\nWondering how to get period stains out of underwear ?\nHere are 10 methods to try when treating both fresh and dried period blood !\nIs It Normal to Stain Your Underwear on Your Period ?\nGiven that having a period is a completely normal experience for every woman , it \u2019 s also normal to have to deal with some blood stains from time to time .\nNobody actually teaches women how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s all trial and error , after all , so mistakes often happen and can result in blood stains on underwear , pajamas , clothing , and even mattresses !\nMost women use either pads or tampons or even a mix of both , depending on where they are in their cycle .\nNeither of these products is completely leak-proof , especially if you have a heavy flow .\nHeavy-flow gals may feel safer using pads since these cover a large part of the underwear and don \u2019 t have to be changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , as you move around , especially while sleeping or exercising .\nYour underwear may get pushed to the side , or the pad you \u2019 re using may just not be absorbent enough !\nUnfortunately , you can also leak through your tampons , even if your flow isn \u2019 t too heavy .\nThat usually happens when you fail to change out your tampon on time .\nIt just gets completely soaked , so there \u2019 s no other place for the blood to go but your underwear !\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Underwear : 10 Ways 1 .\nRun the Underwear Under Very Cold Water You \u2019 d think that squeezing out the blood from your underwear with hot water is the right approach , but that could only make matters worse .\nHot water is ideal for washing dishes because it quickly kills bacteria and various nasty microorganisms .\nWhen it comes to blood-stained underwear , however , it can actually help the blood penetrate deeper into the fibers .\nThe right approach is to use cold water \u2014 and make sure it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the underwear under the faucet and keep squeezing it to get all the blood out .\nIf you caught the stain on time , this just might do the trick !\n2 .\nUse Some Ice on the Stain Seeing as cold water may remove all the blood in just a few minutes , you may not need to do anything else .\nBut if there \u2019 s a bit left , and the stain is still fresh , try rubbing an ice cube over it .\nUsing hot water would essentially cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cementing the stain and ruining your underwear .\nIn contrast , ice or cold water avoids the risk of denaturing the proteins found in blood , which would make the stain more difficult to wash out .\n3 .\nApply Some Hydrogen Peroxide to It Set-in stains can be a bit trickier to resolve , but if you have some hydrogen peroxide at home , you may be able to bleach them away .\nSimply soak a sponge with some of the solution and blot the stain to lift it .\nRun the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to check the progress , and then repeat the whole process until the stain disappears .\nKeep in mind , though , that you should use hydrogen peroxide on white or lighter-colored underwear only .\nAs the liquid could cause color loss on darker clothing , you \u2019 d essentially create another stain while cleaning the blood .\nGot some baking soda or aspirin at home ?\nCrush a few aspirin tablets or pour a few tablespoons of baking soda into a dish and add some water to form a paste .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave it on for about half an hour or overnight .\nOnce the stain is gone , you can wash the underwear as usual .\n5 .\nRub Some Lemon Over the Stain Since lemon juice is very acidic , it can break down the period stain and help you save your underwear .\nYou can use it in two ways : \u2022 Soak a sponge with some lemon juice , and then blot the stain until it \u2019 s gone .\nRemember to rinse the underwear in cold water to check if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wash the underwear if you can still see the stain , as a hot wash cycle would certainly bake it into the fibers .\n\u2022 Cut a lemon in half and rub one half onto the stain , letting the juice flood it .\nAll that rubbing may help you get the stain off faster , but keep in mind that you may have to reapply the juice a few times .\nThe solution to keeping your underwear stain-free may be hiding in your kitchen cupboard !\nGrab some kitchen salt and add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water .\nApply this mixture to either a fresh or a set-in stain and let it work its magic for a while before rinsing the underwear off in cold water .\nYou can also use the saline solution that you rinse your contact lenses with to remove the stain .\nIt works similarly to salt and water , but there \u2019 s no need to mix anything .\nJust pour it onto the stain and reapply if necessary until there are no blood marks left .\n7 .\nSoak the Underwear in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are nasty to deal with , so sometimes , only an enzyme-based stain remover will work .\nThese cleaners break down the stain particles , so they will essentially destroy organic materials , such as blood , urine , and similar .\nOne of the ways you can use this cleaner is by soaking the underwear .\nYou should follow the instructions on the bottle to avoid ruining the fabric completely .\nIn general , though , the gist is that you should add the recommended amount of the solution to cold water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixture for a few hours .\nThen , wash the underwear in cold water again to check if the stain is all gone .\nIf the stain has been on the underwear for a while now , you may need to soak it a few times to get all the blood out .\nAt one point , it may only be barely visible but don \u2019 t give up yet .\nUse a toothbrush and some of the stain remover to gently push the remaining blood particles out of the fabric .\nWhich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stains ?\nYou can go for an all-purpose enzymatic cleaner just in case you have some other non-blood-related stains to deal with .\nThe best kinds often include a combination of different enzymes that tackle proteins like blood , grease , oil , starch molecules , and soil at the same time .\nFor removing blood stains , though , focus on cleaners that contain protease , the enzyme that removes protein-based stains .\nApart from blood , protease can also remove wine and food marks , as well as urine and feces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laundry Detergent or Soap Your laundry detergent or even some plain old soap could get the stain off fast if you \u2019 ve caught it on time .\nBoth liquid and bar soaps should work here , and you can use a toothbrush to rub the stain .\nAlternatively , go for a laundry bar or liquid laundry detergent , once again focusing on those whose formulas include some stain-removing enzymes .\n9 .\nPour Some White Vinegar on the Stain Though the smell may drive you crazy , white vinegar is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product ) .\nAll you have to do is pour some of it onto the stain and leave it on for 10\u201215 minutes .\nOnce the vinegar has had time to penetrate the fibers , you can gently rub or blot the blood marks with a damp washcloth to lift the stain .\nIf it is still visible , repeat the process until it \u2019 s all gone , and then wash the underwear as usual .\nAs strange as it may sound , some water and unseasoned meat tenderizer may finally get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an older , really set-in stain to deal with , get a tablespoon of the tenderizer and wet it with some water .\nPour the solution into a bowl and mix until you get a paste .\nThis paste is really strong , so remember to test it on an inconspicuous part of the underwear to ensure it doesn \u2019 t ruin it .\nOnce you \u2019 re certain it won \u2019 t cause worse stains , rub the paste in with your fingers and leave it on for about half an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once the stain is gone ,

become better at performing tasks or as human beings , it is in their nature to seek new ways to improve themselves .\nIn the pursuit of perfection , many men have stumbled upon the benefits of not ejaculating .\nWhile that might sound counterintuitive , people claim abstaining from ejaculation for a period of time can have tangible positive effects .\nBut is there any truth behind these claims ?\nAnd if yes , what are the actual benefits of semen retention , and should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s time to find out !\nGenerally speaking , semen retention is the practice of not ejaculating for a set time .\nIn its simplest form , semen retention involves abstaining from all sexual activity .\nHowever , some people have taken it a step further and have learned how to orgasm without ejaculating , an action known as a dry orgasm .\nWhile there is still some debate on which practice is healthier , it is believed that both can have mental and physical benefits .\nEven though semen retention might look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been around for centuries .\nAccording to the ancient Chinese philosophy of Taoism , sexual self-control is a way of increasing and maintaining one \u2019 s life force , and ejaculation depletes it .\nIn fact , many techniques that men use during semen retention periods , like retrograde ejaculation and edging , are inspired by Taoist teachings .\nIt \u2019 s important to mention that some people confuse semen retention with the NoFap movement .\nYet , while both communities might overlap , the goal of each practice is different .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help people who suffer from sex and porn addiction .\nOn the other hand , the purpose of semen retention is to achieve a higher state of mind and to improve one \u2019 s physical and mental prowess .\nAs previously noted , the reason people try semen retention depends from person to person .\nBut usually , they boil down to improving mental , physical , and spiritual health .\nHere are just a few of the potential benefits of not ejaculating : Semen contains a small amount of Vitamin B12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also helps transform the food you eat into energy that your body uses throughout the day .\nAnd lastly , Vitamin B12 maintains the health of your nerve and blood cells , preventing a form of anemia , called megaloblastic anemia , which can make you weak and tired .\nSince you lose Vitamin B12 when you ejaculate , you may feel weak and tired right after the act .\nAs a result , if you want to preserve or even increase your energy levels , you should avoid ejaculating as often or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can maintain a healthy amount of this vitamin in your body while also boosting your energy levels .\nAdditionally , research shows that at least seven days of semen retention can improve your testosterone levels by 45 % .\nHowever , that is a temporary peak that returns to its regular levels even with continued abstinence .\nBut if you are someone that constantly masturbates and loses testosterone constantly , you can use semen retention to replenish it .\nRemember that testosterone is linked with a variety of body functions , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , low testosterone levels can cause a loss of interest in sex , fatigue , and even erectile dysfunction .\nMost people get their satisfaction from working hard and achieving their goals .\nHowever , unfortunately , humans are hardwired to always seek shortcuts and stick to them once discovered .\nThat \u2019 s why so many people fall into the trap of excessive masturbation , which provides short-term gratification at seemingly no cost .\nBut that \u2019 s not the case .\nAs proven time and again , masturbation and regular ejaculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dopamine deficiency .\nSo how does that relate to confidence ?\nSimply put , people with low dopamine levels generally have low confidence .\nThat \u2019 s because dopamine deficiency has a negative impact on willpower and motivation , making it nearly impossible to become confident and outgoing .\nIn some instances , this condition has also been tied to depression and anxiety .\nThus , by practicing semen retention , you boost dopamine sensitivity and ultimately increase your confidence .\nAlthough there is no scientific evidence to back up this claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharpening their memory .\nThey claim that you \u2019 ll be able to memorize information much more easily because not ejaculating will help you keep a clear mind and avoid distractions .\nAnd if you think about it , this statement does make some sense , especially if you suffer from porn or masturbation addiction .\nHow many times have you forgotten to finish an assignment or attend an event because you \u2019 ve been ejaculating too often ?\nThe chances are that , by using masturbation as a way to escape your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to forget and even ignore responsibilities .\nIf you find yourself in this situation , it \u2019 s best to give semen retention a try to improve your memory and ability to concentrate .\nAccording to research , depression is one of the most common mental disorders in the United States , with over 16 million adults suffering from it .\nWhile people develop depression for various reasons , it \u2019 s believed that low testosterone levels can increase the risk .\nNaturally , people that ejaculate too often will reduce their testosterone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depression .\nWhat \u2019 s even worse is that depression itself can prompt people to masturbate more than usual in order to feel better , which will only accentuate the condition .\nThis loop can be fatal to the brain .\nIt will affect your emotions deeply , pushing you into the darkest corners of your mind and making you feel like there is no escape .\nIf that happens , you should take a long break from masturbating and ejaculating to allow your brain to rewire itself and heal your depression .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get some advice to avoid further downward spirals .\nTestosterone levels are also associated with sleep quality .\nAs a result , lowering them can disrupt your sleeping pattern , forcing you to wake up multiple times during the night , thus reducing sleep duration .\nWhat \u2019 s interesting about this connection is that sleeping can also increase testosterone levels .\nIn other words , not only will masturbation reduce your testosterone levels and , therefore , your sleep quality , but it will prevent your body from replenishing the missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact on sleep duration .\nBut luckily , semen retention will solve this problem , allowing you to enjoy a good night \u2019 s sleep .\nExperts consider that urges for masturbation and porn are stronger than most addictions , and it \u2019 s easy to see why .\nUnlike drugs and alcohol , excessive masturbation seems to have no real downsides and only benefits , like immense amounts of pleasure .\nHowever , those who suffer from porn addiction know how hard it can be to stop .\nThat can also affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspects of your life .\nFor example , if masturbation is negatively affecting your self-control , you might become prone to other addictions such as gambling or drugs .\nWhile there are several ways to improve restraint , including yoga and meditation , some believe that semen retention is the most effective .\nIt will force you to find other methods of relaxing , increasing the chance of picking up healthy habits .\nOver time , you will build a strong sense of self-control that will help you throughout your life .\nIf @ @ @

just one week .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of voice , it \u2019 s not a stretch to assume that abstaining from ejaculation will deepen your voice .\nAs a matter of fact , many members of the NoFap community have stated that their voices have deepened significantly after just one week of retention .\nSo be sure to try this method if you think that your voice is too soft or if you experience voice inflections

your testosterone levels drop , so will your desire for intimacy .\nAs established , ejaculation will reduce the amount of testosterone your body produces .\nThat \u2019 s why many men deal with erectile dysfunction even before the age of 40 .\nNot only that , but while excessive masturbation will make some people hornier , it won \u2019 t be the same as natural libido .\nMore specifically , while they will be comfortable ejaculating using porn or their preferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with real-life interactions .\nBut by cutting down on masturbation , you will increase your libido and sexual prowess , leading to a happier and more fulfilled sex life .\nThe semen retention community has praised their practice for helping them build muscles and increase their physical strength .\nWhile that might seem like an unsupported claim , it \u2019 s a known fact that testosterone is directly linked to your muscle mass .\nTo put it simply , the more testosterone you have , the easier it is to build muscles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s why many gym trainers recommend people control or abstain completely from masturbating .\nFurthermore , testosterone also strengthens the bones , playing a big role in bone mineral density .\nAnd , the weaker your bones are , the harder it will be to support your internal organs and muscles .\nThe root chakra is one of the most important chakras with its energy based on the earth element .\nIt is often linked with the feeling of grounding and safety and sets the foundation for expansion in your life .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the spine , with its corresponding body area being the perineum .\nIn fact , it is often represented as a cone of energy that goes down from your perineum and slightly bends up .\nPeople that follow NoFap and semen

.\nBesides promoting muscle growth , semen retention can actually improve your overall sports performance .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy levels and clouds your mind .\nAs David Haye , former Heavyweight Champion , puts it : \u201c Climaxing releases too much tension .\nIt releases a lot of minerals and nutrients that your body needs .\nReleasing weakens the knees and your legs.\n\u201d Other famous athletes , like Myke Tyson and Muhammed Ali , also used to refrain from masturbation and sex before matches .\nThe Olympic boxing coach , Harry Wiley , said this about Mohammed Ali : \u201c I believe his thing is sexual control .\nAny kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title.\n\u201d So , if you feel like your athletic performance is lacking , you can try semen retention and follow in the footsteps of many well-known sportsmen .\nHave you ever stepped back and thought about how much time you waste consuming pornography ?\nThe odds are that you are spending at least a couple of hours each day

time to reveal some fun facts about him .\nHow tall is Gru from Despicable Me ?\nAnd how did he go from a spiteful villain to an unlikely hero ?\nRead on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main character of the Despicable Me franchise .\nAt the beginning of the story , he is a super-villain with only one goal .\nNamely , he wants to steal a shrink ray , use it on the Moon , and steal it .\nThis ambitious

in order to steal the shrink ray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and finds that he actually enjoys the time they spend playing .\nAs the franchise develops , Gru slowly leaves his villainous days behind .\nIn fact

version of Lex Luthor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is Gru from Despicable Me ?\nWhen you Google Gru \u2019 s height , you will most likely get a pretty peculiar result .\nNamely , many sources claim that Gru is about 14 feet tall .\nNow , while human logic has no place in the Despicable Me universe , this height is still a bit ludicrous .\nAfter all , such a height would make everything else in that world

that either remain blue if it \u2019 s their natural color or change later on .\nThe term \u201c baby blues \u201d has come to refer to postpartum sadness as a result of this rumor .\nThere \u2019 s an element of fact and fantasy to this notion that this article will explore .\nIf you \u2019 re still wondering , are all babies born with blue eyes , here \u2019 s the final verdict based on scientific observation .\nAre All Babies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no .\nBut most Caucasian babies are born with blue eyes , and many of them lose this eye color over time .\nHowever , according to observations from across the world , the most prevalent eye color at the time of birth was found to be brown , not blue .\nIt \u2019 s true that a lot of babies do start with blue or gray eyes , but this color changes for months after being born .\nA 2016 Stanford study found that nearly two-thirds of babies are born with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 5 with blue eyes .\nThe study included a varied sample size with all ethnicities of people , including Caucasians .\nIt also found that most of the babies born with blue eyes were Caucasian .\nThe color of your eyes , both when you are born and the final color they develop into as you mature , depends on your genes .\nVariations in your genes affect the production , transport , and storage of a pigment known as melanin .\nMelanin is the pigment that is responsible for the color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes .\nThose with high levels of melanin in their skin have darker skin and darker eyes .\nYour eye color is dependent on the amount and quality of melanin present in the front layers of the iris .\nIf you have brown or black eyes , it suggests that you have a large amount of melanin behind your iris .\nPeople with blue eyes have less melanin .\nIf you had no melanin , it would make your eyes look somewhat translucent and grayish in appearance .\nIt also means your iris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of the light coming in , which would be really harmful to the eyes .\nPeople with extremely low levels of melanin in their eyes suffer from a condition known as albinism .\nWhy Do Babies \u2019 Eyes Appear Blue or Gray at Birth ?\nOne of the main reasons behind the perpetuation of the blue eyes myth is that most Caucasian babies are born with blue eyes .\nHowever , over time , 4 out of 5 of these babies lose the blue color in their eyes and develop darker colors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in response to light .\nAnd because babies have only been in the womb where light doesn \u2019 t penetrate , their melanocytes ( melanin-producing cells ) are yet to be activated .\nThis causes lighter eye color in all babies .\nOver time , as they become more exposed to light , their eye color will start to form based on their genetics .\nYes .\nAs previously explained , once the baby \u2019 s eyes start getting exposed to light , they begin secreting more melanin and their eyes turn darker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of weeks and sometimes even lasts for years .\nBut , most of the time , blue eyes darken .\nWhy Some of Them Lose Blue Eyes When They Grow Up ?\nWhether or not a baby will keep their blue eyes into their adult years depends on their genetics .\nIf your parents or grandparents have blue eyes , you \u2019 re more likely to also have blue eyes because you \u2019 re genetically predisposed to low melanin production .\nSometimes , and this is rare , it is possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt \u2019 s due to a condition known as heterochromia iridum , and it \u2019 s usually not serious .\nThis can manifest in different ways .\nYou may have multi-colored eyes or two completely different colored eyes .\nWhen To Be Concerned By the age of 1 year , most babies will have developed their permanent eye color .\nAnd though it \u2019 s rare , there have been cases where the eye color can take up to 6 years to become permanent .\nIf your baby \u2019 s eyes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after birth , you should have them checked out by an eye specialist to rule out conditions like albinism .\nHeterochromia iridum is not dangerous but can be the result of damage to the eye that your baby may have suffered when he/she was unsupervised .\nAs you can never be too careful when it comes to your kids , getting an eye-check up is the best thing to do .", "author": "Jill Walker", "url": "https://freedomdaily.com/are-all-babies-born-with-blue-eyes/", "published":

An octopus \u2019 s brain is complex , to say the least .\nThey have the highest brain-to-body ratio of all invertebrates .\nThis combined with their unique physiology allows octopuses to do extraordinary things .\nThere \u2019 s no animal alive like the octopus .\nHow Many Brains Does An Octopus Have ?\nAccording to the Natural History Museum records , octopuses have been found to possess 9 brains .\nThe main one is located at the center of its body , and the remaining 8 are mini-brains located in each tentacle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry out important functions as each mini-brain can carry out functions independently .\nNo wonder they \u2019 re so extraordinarily versatile with their limbs .\nWhy The Octopus Brain Is So Extraordinary Absolute size is certainly important when it comes to comparing the capabilities of brains , but it \u2019 s not as important as relative size \u2014 the size of the brain as a fraction of the size of the body .\nIt \u2019 s the relative figure that suggests how much brainpower a creature is \u201c investing \u201d in its body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence of neurons in their tentacles , and octopuses have gained the ability to solve their problems with creativity , resourcefulness , and innovation , very similar to what humans can do .\nOctopuses in the wild have been observed to do things like open jars , get inside containers smaller than them , open crab traps , get in and out of fishnets , hoodwink scuba divers , and poach prey from other predators .\nThey \u2019 re notoriously good at making judgments , working with tools , and best of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their unique physiology and neurobiology to their fullest .\nThey can also recognize people and can communicate by using their complex bodies to make signs and gestures .\nOctopuses have as many neurons as the average dog .\nTheir central brain is shaped like a doughnut , and it forms a ring around the esophagus .\nThis ring holds one-third of their neurons .\nTwo-thirds of their neurons are spread throughout their limbs .\nDistributing their brainpower throughout their body in this fashion gives them the ability to act independently and demonstrate intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that octopuses have over 500 million neurons jam-packed in their disproportionate bodies .\nThere are roughly 180 million neurons in the central brain .\nEach of their limbs is connected to the central brain via an elaborate network of over 40 million neurons .\nEach limb also operates as an independent unit but they still work together towards the same goal .\nOctopuses have one of the most unique circulatory systems on the planet , which is not surprising given that they also have one of the most unique anatomies on the planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart , but it \u2019 s for a very special reason .\nHow Many Hearts Does An Octopus Have ?\nOctopuses have 3 hearts and a closed circulatory system , which means their blood always remains inside the vessels .\nThe 3 hearts all have different functions and work simultaneously to keep the octopus alive .\nOctopuses have 3 hearts because of the copper-rich hemocyanin in their blood .\nThis makes their blood more viscous and gooey because of which they need more pressure to push the blood throughout their body , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that .\nAnd since breathing is the most important function for life , the two additional hearts are placed right next to the gills to ensure uninterrupted blood flow .\nThe first is the systemic heart that is located close to the center of the octopus \u2019 s body and circulates oxygenated blood .\nThe other two are peripheral or branchial hearts that pump blood through each of the two gills , and they \u2019 re located right next to the gills .\nThe systemic heart , however , becomes inactive whenever octopuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to crawl more instead .\nNow you may be wondering , do they need all three to survive ?\nNo .\nAs long as the systemic heart is intact , even if one of the two branchial hearts stops working , the octopus can still make it on the other 2 .\nIt may slow down , but it will survive .\nSome say that losing a heart reduces their survival chances because they need the hearts at their gills to assist with oxygenating blood .\nThat may be the case , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death sentence for octopuses .\nIt \u2019 s like what losing a kidney would be for humans .\nOther Wild Facts About The Octopus Octopuses have blue-colored blood , and it \u2019 s much thicker than mammalian blood or the blood of other non-molluscan species .\nThis is due to the presence of hemocyanin .\nHuman blood gets its red color from the iron-based protein hemoglobin .\nOctopus blood , however , uses a much larger copper-based protein called hemocyanin that gives it a dark blue pigmentation .\nInk is arguably the octopus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an ink sac under the digestive gland that produces the ink .\nContrary to popular belief , the ink isn \u2019 t toxic .\nBut both octopuses and squids do produce venom that they can administer through their tentacles .\nThe ink is sprayed out through the funnels called siphons located under the octopus \u2019 s body .\nThese funnels also help shoot the water for swimming and excrete bodily waste .\nBefore it exits the siphon , the ink passes through certain glands that add mucus to the ink to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ward off predators .\nThe darkness of the ink comes from a compound known as melanin .\nOctopuses have special skin cells called chromatophores that can change the appearance of the skin by adjusting color , opacity , or reflectivity .\nChromatophores typically store pigments like yellow , orange , red , brown , and black .\nOctopuses instinctively mix the colors in just the right

ink .\nAnd if done correctly , curious eyes won \u2019 t even be able to tell there is an old tattoo under the new one !\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassed about having a terrible tattoo , here is the 411 on cover-ups \u2014 how they work , as well as the best female dark cover-up tattoos to revitalize your ink !\nDespite public misconceptions , not many people regret getting a tattoo .\nIn a recent survey , over 88 % of people in the US reported being happy with their ink .\nNevertheless , 12 % of interviewees said they wished they didn \u2019 t get at least one of their tattoos .\nWhether it

get a tattoo removal using laser treatments or opt for a tattoo cover-up .\nLaser removal treatments involve breaking down the tattoo pigments using high-intensity light beams .\nThe process can be time-consuming , and depending on the tattoo \u2019 s size , placement , and color , it can require several treatments to completely erase it .\nWhile it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tattooing process itself , it can cause swelling and infections , especially if you don \u2019 t properly treat the wound afterward .\nNevertheless , it \u2019 s still the only method currently available that can completely remove tattoos from someone \u2019 s body .\nTherefore , it \u2019 s not surprising that over 32 % of people in the US choose this procedure to take care of unwanted ink .\nHowever , if you \u2019 re uncomfortable with the idea of lasering your skin , then you can go with option number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAs its name suggests , a cover-up involves tattooing a new piece of ink over an old , unwanted tattoo to hide it .\nWhile most people choose to cover up bad or embarrassing tattoos , you can also cover up ink that \u2019 s faded or gotten lighter over time .\nCover-ups are the perfect option if you want to keep some ink on your body but want to get rid of an old tattoo .\nPlus , they \u2019 re also a good alternative if you \u2019 re on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between $ 200 and $ 700 .\nWhile this is comparable to the cost of most medium-sized tattoos , keep in mind that laser removal requires multiple sessions .\nTherefore , if a tattoo is particularly complex , the total cost of laser treatments can be over $ 2,000 .\nWhen you compare that to the cost of a beautiful $ 700 tattoo , a cover-up is a much more appealing option .\nHow Does It Work ?\nThough getting a cover-up is very common , there are still a lot of misconceptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tattooing involves injecting ink particles at least one millimeter into the dermis , the second layer of skin .\nBecause the process damages the skin , the body fires up the immune system and sends white blood cells to clear out the foreign substance .\nHowever , ink particles are too big for the blood cells to absorb successfully .\nTherefore , the particles end up stuck in the dermis , thus creating a permanent tattoo .\nGetting a cover-up works in much the same way .\nA tattoo artist once again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the previous

you \u2019 re guaranteed to get a professional that will nail the kind of tattoo you want .\nHow to Take Care of a Cover-up Tattoo Getting a cover-up is just the first step of the process .\nThe most important part is taking care of the tattoo afterward since proper tattoo care is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will not only help you avoid infections and potential scarring but also keep your ink intact .\nSo , if you want to guarantee your cover-up stays looking beautiful , here are a few tattoo care tips to follow .\nItchiness is the most common side effect people experience during the tattoo healing process .\nYour skin layers contain thousands upon thousands of sensitive nerves that respond to external stimuli .\nWhen you get injured , your body activates the immune response , sending blood cells to the affected area to repair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the formation of new skin cells , stimulates skin nerves to send signals to the spinal cord .\nYour brain perceives these messages as itchiness and forces you to scratch the area to remove the stimuli .\nHowever , as annoying as the itchiness is , it \u2019 s important to resist the impulse .\nApplying any kind of harsh external pressure to fresh tattoos can tear the treated skin .\nPlus , it puts you at risk of an infection since your fingernails are a hotbed of bacterial growth .\nIf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best course of action is to gently pat your skin with paper tissue or a soft cloth .\nIt may not be the best relief , but it is the safest method to prevent skin damage .\n2 .\nClean Your Tattoo with Soaps for Sensitive Skin One of the first tattoo-care tips many people receive is to use antibacterial soap to keep the wound clean .\nThis is a myth .\nAccording to experts , antibacterial soap is no more effective at killing microbes than regular hand soap .\nSo there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash for that antibacterial label .\nHowever , you should make sure the soap you \u2019 re using is suitable for sensitive skin .\nRegular soap contains a high pH content that strips the skin of its natural oils .\nWhile this isn \u2019 t a problem for healthy skin , freshly tattooed skin won \u2019 t be able to handle the irritation .\nTherefore , it \u2019 s best to use only mild soaps to clean your tattoo .\nAs your tattoo heals , it will start to dry out and scab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and potential tearing , especially if you rub the skin .\nTherefore , it \u2019 s vital to keep the tattoo moisturized to maintain skin elasticity .\nBut don \u2019 t go overboard .\nPiling on moisturizer can clog up your pores and stop your skin from getting much-needed oxygen .\n4 .\nStay Out of the Sun Getting enough sunlight is a vital part of overall health .\nHowever , too much sun can also be detrimental .\nExcessive exposure to sunlight allows UV rays to penetrate the outer layer of skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in painful sunburns , which luckily aren \u2019 t serious in most cases .\nHowever , in the case of freshly tattooed skin , even mild sunburns can result in serious complications .\nUV rays can significantly irritate sensitive skin and cause the tattoo pigment to fade .\nSevere burns can even cause scarring , which can affect the overall appearance of the tattoo .\nTherefore , if you have plans to go to the beach , it \u2019 s best to save them for after you has fully healed .", "author": "Jill Walker", "url":
