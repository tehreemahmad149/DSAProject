in cosmetics has a notorious history \u2013 in just one instance , four women were almost permanently blinded in 1977 because the chemicals failed to keep their mascara clean and safe .\nThat scare prompted regulators to step up the quality and amount of preservatives used in personal care products .\nThe role of preservatives is to protect consumers from harmful bacteria , keeping makeup and personal care products free from potentially dangerous , often unsightly or smelly contamination .\nPreservatives are required in any product that contains water , typically one of the first ingredients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lotions on store shelves .\nBut some preservatives still pose potential health concerns .\nFormaldehyde , for instance , is classified as a known carcinogen by the National

@ is looking to a third way \u2013 formulating products using ingredients that can multitask by providing several necessary functions in keeping goods safe and free from contamination .\nEnter \u201c multifunctional \u201d preservatives \u2013 chemicals that can perform more than one task when used in cosmetics , potentially making them safer to use .\nThe key to safer products lies in the distinction between \u201c preservative \u201d and \u201c preservation.\n\u201d Anything that keeps a product safe should be considered part of the overall strategy of preservation of the product , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be defined as a preservative .\nThat \u2019 s the case with \u201c multifunctional \u201d ingredients that fulfill several functions in a product formulation .\nThink of a chemical known as a humectant , which keeps skin from drying out but also has safe preservative properties .\nOther examples include antimicrobial boosters and stabilizers and other ingredients that help the components dissolve and stay dissolved rather than breaking down or degrading .\nBy using certain ingredients for two or more purposes , companies are able to use fewer ingredients , and fewer that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pare down their product label lists , responding to shoppers \u2019 demands for more transparency about what they buy and use .\nIn some product formulations , these multitasking cosmetics ingredients may be used in combination to eliminate the need for classical preservatives altogether .\nSome multifunctional \u201c preservation boosters \u201d rate well on EWG \u2019 s Skin Deep\u00ae database .\nThe database tracks ingredients of concern in personal care products , which means they have fewer health harms .\nPropylene glycol , caprylyl glycol , 1,2-hexanediol , sorbitan caprylate , butylene glycol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that may serve more than one function in a product .\nMany products with one or more of these ingredients and others bear the EWG VERIFIED\u2122 mark \u2013 they meet our strictest standards for health and safety , are fully transparent about their ingredients , don \u2019 t have any ingredients from our unacceptable list , and won \u2019 t grow bacteria .\nToday the personal care product industry is focused on the total preservation picture : How do a product \u2019 s formulation and packaging combine to create a long shelf life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause problems ; that \u2019 s why a fancy pot of night moisturizer comes with a tiny spatula \u2013 to discourage you from sticking your ( possibly dirty ) finger in and contaminating it .\nManufacturers are looking at not only how multitasking preservatives can keep cosmetics safe and long lasting but also how packaging changes might provide a further boost .\nRecent packaging-as-preservation innovations include unit-dose packaging , single-application and pump-type packaging , and tubes with one-way valves .\nEWG has long urged regulators to strengthen limits on toxic , harmful chemicals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nUntil that happens , multifunctional preservatives may be a path forward .\nThese ingredients are often safer than chemicals traditionally classified as preservatives .\nBut European regulators \u2013 who often drive the decision-making of their U.S. counterparts \u2013 don \u2019 t recognize these chemicals as providing preservation , even when they perform that function .\nHow should American cosmetics makers respond ?\nOne solution is for personal care product regulators and manufacturers to rely on these multitasking chemicals for preservation but without classifying them as preservatives , a label that triggers separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be tested for safety but , ideally , not as preservatives , because few will be permitted for that use in products .\nAs long as our cosmetics law remains woefully outdated , this approach could help make products safer for consumers who are already looking for items without chemicals of concern \u2013

"environmentalworkinggroupewg", "title": "EPA needs funding boost to meet new TSCA requirements", "content": "EWG presents this guest article by David Coursen and Betsy Southerland from the Environmental Protection Network .\nThe Environmental Protection Agency continues to suffer from long-term congressional underfunding , which has starved it of the resources needed to meet its existing and future needs .\nThe agency needs more resources to equip it to handle these all-important challenges .\nBy the start of the Biden administration , the EPA \u2019 s workforce and budget had declined to levels not seen since the 1980s .\nYet when Congress provided the new administration with its first annual EPA appropriation , it rejected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funding \u2013 $ 1.7 billion in all \u2013 to rebuild the agency \u2019 s depleted workforce and restore its core capacity to protect the environment , address climate change , and advance environmental justice .\nThat effectively froze the EPA \u2019 s budget at the 2021 funding levels negotiated by the Trump administration , with a nominal 4 percent \u201c increase , \u201d less than half the inflation rate .\nInadequate funding has been especially harmful to the EPA \u2019 s ability to manage toxic substances .\nThe agency has received no new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2016 amendments to the Toxic Substances Control Act , or TSCA , commonly referred to as the Lautenberg Act .\nThe new amendments gave the EPA deadlines for addressing new mandates , including evaluation of chemical substances already in use based on their health and environmental risks , and restrictions or bans on uses that pose unreasonable risk .\nThe amendments also require the EPA to conduct new chemical safety risk assessments and determine that substances are safe before allowing their use .\nAnd they called for increasing the transparency of chemical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , issuing orders requiring industry to fill critical data gaps , and setting fees needed to fund agency responsibilities .\nAlthough the act imposing these new responsibilities passed with bipartisan support , the Trump administration asked Congress to cut funding for toxics risk review .\nAnd the EPA has received little additional funding since then , though the increased responsibilities doubled the workload .\nThe EPA recently reported to Congress on its implementation of the Lautenberg Act .\nThe report concedes the agency missed many of its statutory deadlines because it lacks the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the schedule Congress intended .\nThe EPA failed to complete the risk evaluations or meet risk management rules required for the first 10 existing chemicals and will likely miss the deadlines for the next 20 existing chemicals .\nThe report also acknowledges that the EPA lacks the resources to review new chemicals and determine their safety within the 90-day statutory time period .\nLack of resources has led to out-of-date , inadequately supported and poorly run IT systems plagued by breakdowns and shutdowns .\nOne recent shutdown in the new chemical review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report points out that during the Trump administration the agency did not adequately assess its need for resources or request the staff and funding required to implement its new responsibilities .\nThat failure is illustrated by the Trump administration \u2019 s consistent requests to reduce TSCA support by up to 35 percent .\nThe EPA \u2019 s much higher fiscal year 2023 budget request , along with the updated TSCA fees rule expected this year , reflect the cost of implementing TSCA .\nTo meet TSCA requirements for the review of new and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget seeks $ 59 million and 175 new full-time staff above the fiscal year 2022 enacted levels .\nThe new resources would allow the EPA to expand and diversify its scientific expertise , enabling faster , more robust chemical reviews of both new and existing chemicals .\nNew resources would be used to modernize IT systems , promoting timely and effective work that will also save money .\nThe EPA expects program costs to decline as it learns to work more efficiently with increased staff and updated IT .\nIn addition , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop better scientific and regulatory tools for assessing chemical risks to potentially exposed and vulnerable subpopulations and addressing occupational safety .\nThe EPA also intends to work more efficiently and kick-start decision-making through earlier identification and resolution of controversies in risk evaluations and management issues .\nThese measures will lead to more efficient and cost-effective program operation .\nCosts may also decline in the existing chemical program because the first chemicals mandated by the act for risk evaluation and management were substances that are widely used , with known health and environmental concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costly and time-consuming .\nSubsequent substances , with fewer uses , may be cheaper and easier to evaluate and address .\nThe new resources included in the 2023 budget request are essential if the EPA is to ensure our nation \u2019 s chemicals are evaluated and managed as Congress intended .\nCongress put enormous effort into developing the 2016 amendments to TSCA , the first major revision of an environmental statute in over 20 years .\nNow it \u2019 s time for Congress to put equal effort into giving the EPA the resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectively .", "author": "rcoleman", "url":

Department of Environmental Quality with imagery from the U.S. Department of Agriculture , overlaying both with floodplain data from the North Carolina Department of Public Safety , which uses Federal Emergency Management Agency standards and practices .\nFloodplains fall into two categories : a 100-year floodplain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flooding in a given year , or a 500-year floodplain , with a 0.2 percent chance of flooding .\nBut in many places across the U.S. , 100-year and even 500-year floodplains are now seeing flooding regularly .\nFEMA \u2019 s floodplain mapping process sometimes relies on old data that can miscalculate elevation and disregard small streams .\nIt also uses previous events to predict future risk .\nIn total , EWG has geolocated 2,489 swine operations raising about 8.8

stored on site , typically open to the elements , before it \u2019 s applied , untreated , to nearby farm fields as a crop fertilizer .\nWhen CAFOs flood , the manure they produce and store on-site can wash into nearby creeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bacteria and pathogens like E. coli , Giardia and salmonella .\nSuch pollution can last for months after a major flooding event .\nEven when applied correctly

.\nThe advocacy groups say the NCUC has failed to comply with a state law known as House Bill 589 , which requires a cost-benefit analysis of rooftop solar .\nTheir joint brief states : House Bill 589 became law in 2017 , but the NCUC did not conduct such a study .\nInstead , it relied on Duke \u2019 s own flawed and one-sided internal review to justify its proposed NEM tariff , which essentially imposes a solar tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly violates state law , the brief says .\nDuke has argued against a commission-led study .\n\u201c Under the state \u2019 s law , it is crystal clear the commission must conduct its own cost-benefit analysis for rooftop solar , \u201d said EWG Senior Energy Policy Advisor Grant Smith .\n\u201c Anything less , especially relying on Duke \u2019 s own deeply flawed and one-sided study , violates the statute and ignores solar \u2019 s clear benefits.\n\u201d \u201c The utilities commission has n't done a study of this change to rooftop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d said Ziyad Habash , from Sunrise Durham .\n\u201c Here \u2019 s what they \u2019 d find if they \u2019 d done the study : Promoting independent solar is better for North Carolina than letting Duke Energy run wild with fracked gas projects .\n\u201c Sunrise Durham will continue to press the utilities commission for a pro-solar verdict in this docket , \u201d Habash added .\nIn its own filing with the NCUC , the state Attorney General \u2019 s Office agreed that Duke \u2019 s internal study does not satisfy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe filing noted that , while Duke investigated the costs , \u201c it did not analyze potential benefits .\n.\n.\n.\n[ which ] are many \u2013 from reducing carbon emissions by offsetting fossil fuel generation to improving grid resilience \u2013 and they should be studied and quantified.\n\u201d The solar plan might also run afoul of the federal Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act , or PURPA , the advocacy groups warned in their filing .\nUnder that law , the NCUC is prohibited from imposing rates on small rooftop solar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other customers with similar usage patterns .\nHowever , Duke \u2019 s proposed tariffs would burden NEM customers with many new charges that other low-usage non-solar customers would not be required to pay .\nThis discrimination against rooftop solar is prohibited by PURPA .\n\u201c Just because Duke would prefer regulators to violate state and federal law by rubber-stamping its proposed solar tax on customers doesn \u2019 t mean they should , \u201d said EWG \u2019 s Smith .\nThese same advocates urged the NCUC in June to hold a full evidentiary hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues .\n\u201c We are very concerned that the commission refused to make Duke officials answer its critics under oath , \u201d said Jim Warren , executive director of NC WARN .\n\u201c This issue is at the core of whether North Carolina finally joins the clean energy revolution or allows Duke Energy to keep stifling renewables and building climate-wrecking gas-fired power plants.\n\u201d Duke also wants to lower by roughly two-thirds the price its monopoly utilities must pay ratepayers for surplus power generated by rooftop solar .\nThat \u2019 s among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nRoy Cooper to help defeat Duke \u2019 s plan .\nDuke is also trying to force solar customers onto a complicated \u201c time of use \u201d schedule according to which the highest rate of solar credits would be awarded between 6 and 9 p.m. , when very little , if any , solar power is generated .\nDuke \u2019 s proposal doesn \u2019 t even reflect daily peak power demand .\nAccording to the arguments filed on Friday , the value of a rooftop solar system would drop anywhere between 20-35 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe new rules would even be imposed on existing solar customers as soon as 2027 .\nOulman , a Duke solar customer who intervened in the docket as an individual , said : \u201c Duke \u2019 s proposed changes would significantly increase the time required to pay back my initial solar system capital investment .\nNo corporation should have the right to change the value of an individual homeowner \u2019 s investment after the purchase is made.\n\u201d Many of the nearly 3,000 public comments received by the NCUC on this issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerns .\n\u201c Local residents and businesses have built and continue to build solar arrays at their own expense , saving all ratepayers ' money by avoiding the costs of expensive fossil gas plants or transmission upgrades , \u201d said Cathy Buckley , director of statewide organizing for the North Carolina Alliance to Protect Our People and the Places We Live .\nIn their proposed order , the groups suggest that the NCUC deny Duke \u2019 s application , initiate a process for conducting a true cost-benefit analysis , and require Duke to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results of that study , which exempts existing net metering customers from any new tariff for the life of their system .\nThe Environmental Working Group ( EWG ) is a nonprofit , non-partisan organization that empowers people to live healthier lives in a healthier environment
