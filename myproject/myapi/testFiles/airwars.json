longstanding Chair of Airwars Elizabeth Minor has stepped down due to ill health .\nElizabeth Minor , the longstanding voluntary Chair of Airwars , has sadly stepped down due to ill health , the organisation \u2019 s Board has announced .\nSince joining the Airwars Board in summer 2016 , Elizabeth has been a critical driver of the organisation \u2019 s many successes .\nA leading conflict

Journalism and Trauma ; and was a champion throughout of the highest ethical and research standards .\nShe also chaired the Airwars Advisory Board .\n\u201c I \u2019 m very proud to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 Boards as the organisation has developed from a very small startup to the established , professional and widely respected organisation it is today , \u201d Elizabeth said this week .\n\u201c Of

shakeup of Pentagon civilian harm policies", "content": "Civilian harm reduction proposals cautiously welcomed by NGOs - but delivery will be key .\nSecretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has announced major proposals to overhaul how the US military monitors , assesses and documents when its actions kill civilians , a move warily welcomed by human rights and civilian harm mitigation NGOs .\nBuilding on years of documentation by groups like the Syrian Network for Human Rights and Airwars , since late 2021 the New York Times has produced a series of deep investigations documenting systemic flaws in the way US military operations track casualties from their strikes .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US military \u2019 s approach to civilian harm and raised pressures on the Biden administration to intervene .\nIn a directive released on January 27th , Austin announced a major shake-up of Department of Defense ( DoD ) policies on civilian harm reduction , including the establishment of a \u2018 civilian protection center of excellence \u2019 .\n\u201c The protection of innocent civilians in the conduct of our operations remains vital to the ultimate success of our operations and as a significant strategic and moral imperative , \u201d Austin told reporters .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Defense for Policy , Dr Colin Kahl , 90 days to prepare a \u201c comprehensive \u201d Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response Action Plan , or CHMRAP , that emphasises that \u201c efforts to protect civilians are the responsibility of all leaders throughout the ( DoD ) , always , and not only that of our commanders and personnel in the field in the execution of missions assigned.\n\u201d Austin \u2019 s directive also paves the way for the establishment of a new \u2018 civilian protection center of excellence \u2019 which according to DoD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expedite and institutionalize the advancement of our knowledge , practices , and tools for preventing , mitigating , and responding to civilian harm.\n\u201d And there are also plans to shake up how the Pentagon collects , shares and learns from casualty data ; to re-examine the issue of condolence payments to victims ; and to \u201c Incorporate guidance for addressing civilian harm across the full spectrum of armed conflict into doctrine and operational plans , so that we are prepared to mitigate and respond to civilian harm in any future fight.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a forthcoming Department of Defense Instruction , or DODI \u2013 a long awaited department-wide policy on civilian harm reduction .\nAirwars was among more than a dozen US and international NGOs which engaged extensively with the Pentagon on the DODI \u2013 which has been awaiting a signature since November 2020 , when drafting was completed .\nAccording to Austin , the DODI \u201c should be informed by the CHMRAP and presented to the Secretary of Defense for signature within 90 days of the CHMRAP \u2019 s conclusion \u201d \u2013 meaning it should come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austin \u2019 s directive and the promised release of the DODI could be a crucial step towards standardising the US military \u2019 s approach to civilian harm assessments across US commands , \u201d Emily Tripp , Airwars \u2019 research manager , said .\nMarc Garlasco , a military advisor at PAX and former civilian harm assessor with NATO , was among those cautiously welcoming the Pentagon announcements .\n\u201c The memo sends a strong message that civilian harm mitigation ( CHM ) is not simply an issue for counterinsurgency .\nThe US military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great power competition , \u201d he said in a thread on Twitter .\nOn the same day that Secretary Austin announced his shakeup , the RAND Corporation also published a major Congressionally-mandated review of the US military \u2019 s approaches to mitigating civilian harm .\nThe deep-dive report , \u2018 US Department of Defense Civilian Casualty Policies and Procedures , \u2019 argues that while the DoD may have made progress in some areas , \u201c additional concrete steps are overdue.\n\u201d RAND points to several weaknesses in the DoD \u2019 s own policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often did not \u201c sufficiently engage external sources \u201d such as Airwars before they concluded investigations and designated them as non-credible ; that investigations are often treated as independent of each other and so levels of detail between them vary widely ; and that military assessments are often subject to long delays .\nSeveral graphics in the report demonstrate the often extreme gap between US military estimates of civilian harm , and those of NGOs such as Amnesty International , Human Rights Watch and Airwars \u2013 noting that in Syria in 2019 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alleged from US actions , yet with only 21 fatalities so far officially admitted .\nThe RAND report makes a number of recommendations , noting that many were called for several years ago .\nThese include incorporating civilian harm assessments into intelligence estimates ; reducing the eligibility conditions for those who can claim ex gratia payments ; and implementing a standardised civilian harm reporting process across conflicts .\nAirwars was among several stakeholders which met with RAND during the drafting of the report .\n\u201c Many of the critical recommendations in this valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NGO community and by Congress \u2013 and we urge the Biden Administration to now act swiftly , \u201d Airwars director Chris Woods said .", "author": "Joe Dyke", "url":

"Investigation suggests a PKK bomb , rather than the Turkish military , may have killed two Iraqi holidaymakers in Kurdish region On August 22nd 2021 , security forces in the Kurdish region of Iraq came across a battered white Kia Sportage at the side of the road .\nIn it , they found the bodies of two men .\nAhmed Shukr , 40 , and Youssef Omar , 26 , from the city of Mosul , were on holiday in the mountainous Darkar region of Zakho district , a popular retreat for domestic tourists seeking to escape the sweltering summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two days earlier .\nWhile a place of leisure and relaxation for some , Iraqi Kurdistan is also in the midst of an ongoing conflict between the Turkish armed forces and the Kurdistan Workers \u2019 Party ( PKK ) , a Marxist militant group that calls for greater autonomy and increased rights for Kurds within Turkey .\nSeeking to crush the group , Turkish forces have expanded into parts of northern Iraq , backed by air and artillery strikes .\nDozens of civilians have been killed in the fighting , with thousands displaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men \u2019 s deaths last August to either a Turkish air , drone or artillery strike .\nAt the scene Omer Jalal , a relative , told Rudaw : \u201c You are in your own country and it is safe , but you get bombed by the Turks\u2026 .\nWhere is our government ?\n\u201d .\nYet an Airwars investigation piecing together the final moments of the two men \u2019 s lives has found they were most likely killed by a roadside bomb , possibly planted by the PKK .\nOne of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such munitions in Iraqi Kurdistan , it could indicate a dangerous trend for those living in or visiting these conflict-affected areas .\nThe investigation also reveals how the spread of the conflict has resulted in a sharp rise of reported civilian harm in the Darkar region .\nOn the morning of August 20th , Shukr and Omar apparently set off from their resort , keen to explore the rugged mountains .\nAt the outskirts of the village of Sharanish , the men took a turn , seemingly unaware they were entering a militarized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d or \u201c Forbidden \u201d zone .\nIn recent years Turkey has set up military bases in areas previously largely unaffected by the conflict , including the area around Sharanish .\nFarhad Mahmood , the mayor of Batifa sub-district , said that Iraqi border guards who had been manning a roadside checkpoint in the area mistook the tourist for locals and waved them through .\nMoments later that error proved fatal .\nAn explosion hit the car , which ultimately crashed into a rock .\nLocal media alleged it had been hit by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike .\n\u201c A Turkish artillery shell fell near their car , \u201d a security source in the predominantly Kurdish area told the Shafaq News Agency .\nBut later that day a video , published by local media outlet Kurdistan 24 , emerged that challenged the prevailing narrative .\nIt appeared to show a car driving along a rural road when an explosion rocks it .\nThe car then drives out of shot .\nThe first challenge was to locate the strike and check whether the video showed the same explosion that killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in the base of a valley .\nA steep sparsely-vegetated hillside is visible to the right , while a low gradient heavily forested slope can be seen on the left .\nIn addition to the distinctive contours of the road , an earthen bank runs along its left side .\nA structure is visible in the top right of the frame , indicated by a solid red box and the letter B .\nA cylindrical structure , seen closer to the vehicle , is indicated by a dashed red box and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the frame , finding the location using satellite imagery is considerably easier if you know where these features are in relation to one another ( i.e north , south , east or west ) .\nThe fact it was sunny on the day the video was filmed helped with this process .\nThe size and orientation of the shadows generated by the explosion helped to identify both the approximate time of day , and the direction the car was traveling in .\nAfter the explosion there is a dust plume perhaps 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shorter than its height \u2013 indicating the sun is high in the sky and therefore that the incident occurred around noon .\nSince the shadow appears to the right of the plume \u2013 and Iraq being in the northern hemisphere where at noon shadows orient north \u2013 this led to the conclusion the car was traveling from west to east .\nReports indicated the incident occurred close to the village of Banke .\nUsing this information Airwars \u2019 geolocation team was able to identify the below location as the site of the explosion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video and highlighted in image 1 , is also visible in satellite imagery .\nStructure A appears to have been built after \u200b\u200bNovember 2019 , the date of the most recent , high-quality , publicly available satellite imagery of the area .\nFrom this , we are able to determine that the men were driving west to east on a stretch of road between the villages of Sharanish and Banke .\nUsing Google Earth , we were then able to locate images of first responders loading the bodies of the two men into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metres from the strike , suggesting the car drove on , likely as the wounded driver attempted to keep it on the road , before eventually crashing .\nThe video was reportedly filmed from a nearby Iraqi border guard position .\nOnce the location of the strike had been confirmed , Airwars was able to narrow in on a possible location of the guard post .\nHaving verified that the video very likely showed the explosion that killed Shukr and Omar , the question became what photographs and video could reveal about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to review the visual material available .\nChris Cobb Smith , a munitions expert and former Major in the British Army , said it was very unlikely to have been artillery fire from a nearby Turkish base .\n\u201c Artillery is notoriously inaccurate and would seldom be used to engage a target like this , \u201d he said .\nHe noted that artillery strikes would typically result in the location , or in this case the car ( below ) , being pockmarked by shrapnel , but there was very little evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the crumpling and contortion to the bodywork seemed to have been caused primarily by the blast effect .\nRoger Davies , a former British Army ammunition specialist with decades of experience analysing explosions from both conventional munitions and improvised devices , said he was \u201c 95 percent certain this is an IED strike.\n\u201d \u201c The fragmentation damage could have been caused by a small amount of shrapnel , or by a metal container used to house the bomb , or stones and rubble thrown upwards by the force of the explosion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an artillery round , \u201d said Mr. Davies .\nMr. Davies said the video and photographs suggested an IED weighing in the order of 5kg , likely initiated by a radio signal and laid above ground , a tactic commonly employed by those who want to limit the time they spend installing a device , \u201c especially if they suspect they are under observation.\n\u201d Due to the colour of the smoke given off by the blast , TNT \u2013 a carbon-rich explosive commonly used in conventional munitions \u2013 was ruled out as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the car may have been targeted by a guided munition , Mr. Davies said he thought it unlikely , as neither the damage to the vehicle nor video footage showed evidence of such a strike .\nA cursory look at nearby mountains reveals why so many of the sources may have implicated Turkey in the strike , and why whoever planted the bomb may have chosen the location .\nIn the latter half of 2020 , the area witnessed a significant military build-up , one that forced many local residents to flee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mahmoud , told Rudaw : \u201c It \u2019 s ( the Darkar area ) on the main street .\nIt \u2019 s a tourist place\u2026 people come and go and the situation was very calm\u2026 Two months ago the Turkish army and PKK ruined our situation.\n\u201d The arrival of Turkish troops in the area may suggest they were the intended target .\nOn November 4th 2020 , one member of the Iraqi Kurdish security forces was killed and two others wounded when IEDs struck their vehicles in Chamanke sub-district in Dohuk .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ HPG ) , the PKK \u2019 s military wing , accepted responsibility for the strike after it said government forces encroached on their self proclaimed area of operation .\nThe attack resulted in condemnation of the PKK from the US , France and the federal Iraqi government .\nDespite this , reported civilian harm in Iraq stemming from PKK IED strikes has remained low .\nWhether the deaths of Ahmed and Youssef were caused by an IED or some other action , it \u2019 s clear that risks continue for civilians in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Airwars recorded four instances of civilian harm in the Darkar area , resulting in two civilian deaths and four injuries , a dramatic increase in comparison to previous years .\n\u2022 On May 26th , two shepherds were injured by alleged Turkish artillery fire that struck the village of Behri .\nVideo of the aftermath of the attack featured in a recent PBS News report .\n\u2022 On August 10th Abdulrahman Yousif , 55 , was seriously injured in an alleged Turkish artillery strike on Bosal village , according to the monitoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was reportedly picking figs in his orchard when he was targeted by artillery fire from a recently constructed Turkish military base .\n( As a single-source claim Airwars deemed the assessment \u2018 Weak \u201d . )\n\u2022 On December 27th , a 42-year-old woman was injured in an alleged Turkish air or artillery strike in the village of Banke .\nShe was reported to be in a serious condition and was transported to Zakho hospital for treatment .\nOne source alleged that the artillery fire originated from a Turkish military base in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s construction , Airwars had recorded just one incident of reported civilian harm in Batifa sub-district over the course of six years of monitoring \u2013 an alleged Turkish artillery strike that injured four civilians in 2017 .\nAirwars \u2019 investigation into the events of August 20th suggests that Ahmed Shukr and Youssef Omar were killed by a roadside IED rather than by a Turkish military attack , as was widely reported at the time .\nWhile no party has claimed responsibility for the attack , suspicion may point to members of the Kurdistan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a case of mistaken identity .\nData collected by Airwars also shows how a military build-up in the area resulted in a significant rise in reported civilian harm .\nIn the past year , up to 36 civilians have been killed by alleged Turkish military actions inside Iraqi Kurdistan .\nAs the conflict spreads into more populated areas , there is a potential for the use of such IEDs to become a more commonplace feature of the conflict in northern Iraq , greatly increasing the threat already posed to civilians .\nIn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict has had far wider implications in terms of displacement .\nIn a recent report by PBS News , a villager from Sharanish claimed that 24 out of 26 nearby villages have been emptied by fighting in the past two years .", "author": "Joe Dyke", "url": "https://airwars.org/news-and-investigations/who-killed-ahmed-and-youssef/", "published": "Tue, 08 Feb 2022 08:56:20 +0000",

Newly declassified documents reveal serious concerns", "content": "Coalition 's 'request for information ' system in the spotlight in light of New York Times document release For many years during the international air campaign against the so-called Islamic State ( ISIS ) , Airwars participated in information sharing with the US-led Coalition on civilian harm incidents .\nWhen local Syrian and Iraqi sources alleged civilians had been killed or injured , the Coalition would review the event and on occasion ask Airwars for specific details .\nThese official Requests for Information ( RFIs ) ranged from seeking the coordinates of a specific building , to requesting details about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or neighbourhoods .\nAirwars \u2019 team would then pore over our own archives ; geolocate events by exploiting every piece of known information ; and then send back a detailed response .\nWhile there were periods when our public relations with the Coalition were fraught , we continued to work privately with its civilian harm assessment team over several years , in the hope that our technical assistance would lead to more recognition of civilian harm .\nYet a newly published trove of more than 1,300 previously classified military assessments , released by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawsuit , has highlighted that the US-led Coalition \u2019 s internal reporting processes for civilian harm were often defective and unreliable .\nThis , The Times claims , led the Coalition to radically underestimate the number of Syrian and Iraqi civilians it killed .\nThose 1,300 assessments of civilian harm also provide an opportunity to assess how the Coalition itself carried out the RFI process .\nAirwars selected a sample of 91 incidents between December 2016 and October 2017 .\nIn each case , the US-led Coalition had specifically reached out to Airwars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn 70 of these cases , we were able to match our response directly to declassified assessments in the Times database .\nThe results are concerning .\nIn total , in only three of the 70 cases where the Coalition asked Airwars for more information did it eventually go on to accept causing civilian harm .\nThe other 67 incidents were deemed \u2018 non-credible.\n\u2019 In 37 of the cases we were able to provide exactly the information they requested .\nIn the other 33 cases we provided as much as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on victims .\nAirwars \u2019 monitoring has found that at least 8,168 civilians have been killed by the US-led Coalition during the campaign against ISIS .\nThe Coalition , however , has accepted responsibility for 1,417 .\nWe identified three worrying trends in how our information was treated during the RFI process .\nThe first was that the Coalition sometimes closed assessments before we had even provided our feedback , or did not reopen them when new information was provided .\nOn April 30th , 2017 , three civilians were reportedly killed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tabaqa in western Raqqa province , Syria , with up to eighteen more people wounded .\nAll sources attributed the attack to the US-led Coalition that was , at the time , involved in one of the most intense stretches of its grinding campaign against ISIS \u2013 striking dozens of targets a day .\nThe three civilians who died were reportedly women , although their identities remain unknown .\nOngoing fighting in the area had led to mass displacement of civilians and the ones who stayed behind were often trapped between ISIS and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attack had hit a civilian neighbourhood near the \u2018 church roundabout.\n\u2019 In the middle of 2017 , Airwars wrote to the Coalition raising concerns about this incident .\nLater that year , the Coalition opened up an initial assessment on the event .\nIts own civilian casualty assessment team wrote to Airwars on November 22nd with a simple question : \u201c \u200b\u200bWhat are the coordinates for the alleged CIVCAS ?\n\u201d Shortly afterwards , Airwars provided close coordinates for the event to the Coalition following work by our own geolocations team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a satellite image of the likely location \u2013 a 350 x 260m area north east of the roundabout .\nYet we now know that some time before our email was sent , the Coalition had privately deemed the event to be \u2018 non-credible \u2019 .\nIt asserted that the claim needed to \u201c be more specific to justify performing a search for strikes.\n\u201d Even after receiving Airwars \u2019 response , there is no evidence the case was reopened .\nA year later , a press release declared that there was \u201c insufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details to assess its credibility.\n\u201d To date the US-led Coalition still does not accept responsibility for the deaths of those three women .\nIn total we tracked at least 18 such cases where the Coalition had already closed case files before we had responded .\nIn none of these cases was there any evidence they reopened the file .\nA second dispiriting trend was how rarely Airwars \u2019 work actually prompted further review by the Coalition .\nAs the New York Times files show , the vast majority of Coalition probes stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a series of yes/no boxes where a single \u2018 no \u2019 leads to the allegation being deemed \u2018 non-credible.\n\u2019 In only seven of the 70 cases where we provided information did this lead to additional review steps being taken \u2013 in most cases turning an initial assessment into a Civilian Casualty Assessment Report ( CCAR ) .\nThese are slightly longer assessments but again often end in non-credible determinations .\nIf the evidence is more significant \u2013 or if there are claims of a breach of the laws of war \u2013 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called an AR15-6 could be carried out .\nWe did not find any cases in the sample that went as far as an AR15-6 , even among the three cases deemed credible by Inherent Resolve .\nA third trend was that in cases where Airwars itself was not able , from local reporting , to specify exactly which civilians were killed in particular locations , the Coalition almost always rejected such allegations .\nParticularly during intense urban fighting , local reports of civilian harm often comprise casualties from a number of weapon releases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , which can make it difficult to ascertain the exact location where each victim was harmed .\nThis would have been especially challenging during 2017 , the most intense year of bombing in Iraq and Syria , when the sheer number of Coalition strikes made allegations even harder to disentangle .\nWhen a few incidents were reported in the same area , the Coalition would often request that we specify which civilian harm occurred in which location .\nIn 15 cases , the Coalition decided that , rather than search multiple areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using justifications such as \u201c the CIVCAS numbers need to be broken up into the neighbourhoods that they belong to.\n\u201d A typical case was the strikes on January 3rd 2017 which killed up to 22 civilians and injured 29 more in eastern Mosul , reportedly targeting two houses close together .\nTwo children were among those reported killed .\nOnly one of the fatal victims \u2013 Younis Hassan Abdullah al-Badrani \u2013 was named in reports .\nAn RFI sent by Coalition assessors asked Airwars which civilian casualties were attributed to which of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hermat , Ma \u2019 moon .\nWe replied back with the exact time and coordinates of an airstrike in Ma \u2019 moon , although we also noted that sources did not differentiate

quality of data about civilians killed and injured on both sides has remained poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights releases regular reports on human rights in Ukraine , it is

conflict: a rough guide", "content": "Do civilians who take up arms to resist Russian invasion lose protected status ?\nOn February 24th , Russian forces launched a full-scale attack on Ukraine .\nIn the weeks since , Ukrainian government agencies and officials , including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy , have encouraged citizens to take up arms and defend their homeland .\nThere have been widespread reports of state officials handing out thousands of guns and circulating information about making homemade explosives such as Molotov cocktails .\nCivilians have some protections during times of armed conflict .\nIt \u2019 s unlawful , according to the binding Geneva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilians to be deliberately targeted \u2013 and any attacks by belligerents need to be both proportionate , and to distinguish between civilians and fighters .\nYet the potential involvement in Ukraine of civilians in hostilities against an invading state \u2019 s military has raised questions concerning their legal status under International Humanitarian Law ( IHL ) .\nSome voices online have even claimed that those who receive weapons may no longer enjoy civilian status for the duration of the war .\nThis briefing explores the likely legal status of those civilians that take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the implications of these classification are of particular importance to organisations like Airwars that monitor civilian harm , as well as for journalists , academics and others .\nThis is not intended as a guide for legal professionals , though others have written guides along those lines .\nIn an international armed conflict , there are basically two classifications \u2013 combatant and civilian .\nAccording to IHL , combatants are members of the armed forces of the party to an armed conflict , and so have the right to directly participate in hostilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conflict between states , and they directly participate in hostilities .\nThey are also \u2013 generally \u2013 afforded immunity for acts committed while they are a combatant unless those acts constitute war crimes .\nIf detained , they would be considered a prisoner of war .\nBy contrast a civilian is typically defined in negative terms \u2013 that is , as someone who is not a combatant .\nCivilians are afforded protection by international humanitarian law .\nCivilians and civilian objects \u2013 such as residential buildings \u2013 can not be indiscriminately or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Geneva Conventions and their additional protocols outline protection of civilians during armed conflict , both international and non-international , and declare that they \u201c shall enjoy general protection against dangers arising from military operations.\n\u201d However , there are some circumstances in which someone can lose that protection .\nThe statement above is caveated by another rule , that civilians are only protected against attack \u201c unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.\n\u201d What is Direct Participation in Hostilities ?\nA person is understood to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as a civilian as soon as they directly participate in hostilities ( DPH ) .\nThis can range from working to make a Molotov cocktail , to picking up a gun and using it to harm a member of the attacking force .\nObviously , DPH follows on from two crucial components \u2013 one , that there are hostilities underway , and two , that an individual is directly participating in them .\nThe notion of DPH is often fact- and context-specific , and given how dynamic the situation in Ukraine is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open to question .\nHowever , as laid out in the International Committee of the Red Cross \u2019 Interpretive Guidance on DPH , there are broadly speaking , three cumulative conditions that have to be met before a specific act could be considered as direct participation .\n\u2022 There has to be a threshold of harm \u2013 so for example a specific act has to adversely affect the operations or capacity of one party in the conflict , or damage people or objects that are protected against direct attacks ( eg civilian objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct causal relationship between the specific act and the harm which arises from that act .\n\u2022 This act has to have been carried out with the intention to aid one party in the conflict at the expense of the other .\nSo in the Ukrainian context , a civilian who participates in a specific act in this way \u2013 for example , picking up a gun or throwing Molotov cocktails \u2013 is considered a legitimate target for , and such a period of time when , they are directly participating in hostilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Molotov cocktail , that would likely be considered a preparatory act for directly participating in hostilities , which would also likely make this person targetable .\nAs soon as an individual directly participates in hostilities , for such a period of time as they continue to do so , they are generally understood to be a lawful target .\n\u201c One does not lose civilian status , rather one loses protection from being directly attacked , \u201d explains Natia Kalandarishvili-Mueller , Professor of International Law at ALTE University Georgia and lecturer in IHL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Article 51 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions , \u201c civilians shall enjoy the protection afforded by this Section unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.\n\u201d \u201c Put differently , for the duration of one \u2019 s direct participation in hostilities , one may be directly attacked by the adversary , \u201d Kalandarishvili-Mueller added .\nOnce an individual ceases to directly participate \u2013 through going back home , putting down weapons , or otherwise not directly participating in hostilities \u2013 they regain full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ICRC \u2019 s guidance on DPH , civilians \u201c lose and regain protection against direct attack in parallel with the intervals of their engagement in direct participation in hostilities ( sometimes referred to as the \u201c revolving door \u201d of civilian protection ) .\n\u201d If they take up arms once , can civilians be targeted throughout the conflict ?\nThere is a generally understood distinction in IHL between continuous , status or function-based loss of protection and temporary , activity-based loss of protection .\nIn the first category , the presumption is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function .\nThis would entail joining or belonging to an organised armed group , whether state or non-state , or future intent to directly participate in hostilities .\nIn the second category , an individual who arms themselves with a gun and aims to maim or kill a member or members of an invading force , and then does not use the gun again after a period of time , would ultimately not be participating in hostilities after they have put the gun down again .\nThey would not necessarily be immune from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their actions at that point or after , depending on the domestic legal system , but they can not be attacked .\nBelow , we apply those distinctions to the Ukrainian conflict more directly .\nThe Ukrainian army and regional governments gave out tens of thousands of weapons and encouraged people to use them .\nMight all those people automatically become targetable if they accept weapons ?\nDistinctions between civilians , armed forces , and non-state armed groups have become difficult in contemporary conflicts , particularly as modern warfare increasingly occurs in civilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-state armed groups .\nIn Ukraine so far there have been three broad ways in which citizens who have chosen to fight have responded to the Russian invasion .\nEach one has different legal implications .\nThe first is those citizens voluntarily enlisting for the Ukrainian army to fight the Russian invasion .\nIn doing so , individuals will lose their right to not be directly attacked for at least as long as they are part of the regular armed forces .\nThe second is those that have engaged in ad hoc but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loose command structure emerging as part of a movement known as the Territorial Defense Forces .\nThese groups have been identified as wearing yellow armbands and other insignia to distinguish them , potentially from both Ukrainian civilians and invading Russian troops .\nFour conditions have to be met to be considered irregular combatants : \u2022 Being commanded by a person responsible for subordinates \u2022 Operating in accordance with the laws and customs of war \u2013 such as not firing indiscriminately on civilians or civilian objects .\nFor the duration of the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilian status .\nIn this specific conflict , Emily Crawford from the University of Sydney Law School has argued that the Territorial Defense Forces and groups like them have reached the threshold of being combatants .\nThe third , and legally most complicated , group is those Ukrainian civilians who have taken guns distributed by the state or the army , or those who have prepared and thrown Molotov cocktails .\nOfer Fridman , a Senior Lecturer in War Studies at King \u2019 s College , University of London , explained that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be treated more of a continuum than a hard yes or no .\n\u201c Essentially , the more you participate , the more of a target you are , \u201d Fridman said .\n\u201c Participating on a low level \u2013 providing shelter , helping the wounded , driving ammunition , or even supporting from home by handing out leaflets \u2013 does not necessarily turn you into a legitimate target .\nParticipating on a high level , such as in the way militants do , definitely does.\n\u201d It is important to remember people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are directly participating in hostilities .\nSchools of thought do differ about whether or not someone who continuously participates in hostilities but is not part of a group doing so can be considered a civilian .\nThe ICRC \u2019 s guidance \u2013 which is the classical interpretation of the relevant article \u2013 takes a narrow view of what constitutes DPH by asserting that only when an individual is engaging in preparatory acts for or directly engaging in hostilities are they targetable .\nAs such , an indiscriminate attack on the house or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered an attack on civilians , not on civilians engaging in DPH , and so would be considered unlawful .\nAs Professor of IHL Dapo Akande notes , \u201c This suggests that the ICRC rejects the notion of continuous direct participation .\nThis is the idea that a person who takes a direct part in hostilities remains a valid target until he opts out of the hostilities through extended non-participation.\n\u201d However , others may argue that if someone is participating in hostilities but has periods of rest between specific periods of participation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become preparing for DPH .\nAs such , if an individual uses a gun to defend their house or their building \u2013 but is not part of a command structure , does not wear a distinctive insignia , and does not carry their arms openly and is also not acting in accordance with the laws of war \u2013 it is likely that when they put down their weapon , they would not be considered a lawful target .\nEven if everyone in their apartment building had guns or molotov cocktails and acted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they weren \u2019 t coordinating through a command structure and did not have a distinctive uniform or insignia \u2013 then by following the ICRC guidance , they would still be considered civilians when they stopped engaging in those acts .\nAgain , there are classical interpretations of these distinctions , such as the narrow scope taken by the ICRC , although there have been many court cases and rulings , particularly in the US and Israel , where the exact definition of DPH has been defined differently , along the lines of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Professor Akande explains , \u201c One danger of the continuous direct participation approach is that it increases the possibility of error given that a person can be targeted at moments when not involved in hostile acts .\nSuch an approach to targeting raises the question how the belligerent can be confident that an individual poses a significant danger and will return to the fight.\n\u201d With regards to the conflict in Ukraine , the line about who is directly aiding the war effort and who is directly participating in hostilities becomes more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement of tonnes of explosives in cities in Ukraine may or may not be considered to be directly participating in hostilities .\nThis is likely dependent on how integral their actions are to the continuing hostilities .\nFor example , the ICRC \u2019 s guidance suggests that building blockades or road blocks should not be considered DPH as it \u2019 s indirect participation .\nBut crucially if it is ever unclear whether a person has civilian status or not , the assumption must always be that they are a civilian .\nAs an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states : \u201c in case of doubt whether a person is a civilian , that person shall be considered to be a civilian.\n\u201d If detained , would an armed civilian be treated as a prisoner of war ?\nIn terms of detention , an article in one of the Geneva Conventions \u2019 additional protocols offer some basic guarantees of humane and non-discriminatory treatment .\nFurther protections are offered to those that have prisoner of war status under Article 4 , Geneva Convention III .\nArticle 4 of Geneva Convention III requires at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a member of an organised armed group or militia with a recognisable command structure that carry arms openly , and are recognisable at a distance .\nAs such it would be unlikely that most civilians taking part in the Ukrainian conflict would meet that criteria .\nHowever , this does not mean that a civilian captured under these circumstances could be degraded , abused or tortured .\nThey must be afforded the fundamental guarantees laid out in Article 75 Additional Protocol I .\nThe internment of the civilians is also regulated by Articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geneva Convention IV .\nIs Russia respecting protection of civilians under IHL in Ukraine ?\nIt is unclear how significantly the above distinctions between combatants and civilians \u2013 which are laid out in both the Articles of and Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions , overly impact the targeting or attacking decisions of Russian forces .\nWhile in the early days of the war Russia \u2019 s targets were often military , there have been extensive and widespread reports of civilian neighbourhoods being directly targeted .\nThere have also been recent reports of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unlawful for a military to fire \u2013 being targeted , with several civilians confirmed to have been killed when trying to escape to safety .\nRussian attacks have also been characterised by the bombardment of cities using often indiscriminate weapons , including heavy artillery , cluster munitions , airstrikes and cruise missiles .\nIn summary , the mere fact of civilians taking a weapon from the government does not necessarily mean Ukrainians lose their civilian status .\nIf individuals join an active armed organisation \u2013 whether the formal military or a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose civilian status and be considered a combatant .\nHowever for those at home with a weapon , they would likely remain civilians unless and for such a period of time that they are directly participating in hostilities , at which point they would be considered a lawful target .\nAnd if there is ever any doubt , it should always be assumed that the individual is a civilian .", "author": "Joe Dyke", "url": "https://airwars.org/news-and-investigations/civilian-status-in-the-ukraine-conflict-a-rough-guide/",

5,318 children , 2,953 women and 4,208 men where the gender and ages of victims are known .\nOur data includes all allegations where one or more local sources pointed to Russian forces as being responsible for civilian casualties \u2013 including those events where additional sources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small number of events , other actors such as the US-led Coalition or Turkey ) .\nIn total these contested incidents account for 60 % of the civilian fatalities linked to Moscow \u2019 s actions in Syria in our archive .\nUntil Russia and the Syrian regime are transparent about their actions in Syria , it is highly likely that we will not be able to identify the specific perpetrator of each contested event .\nThat said , the likelihood that civilians were harmed in such attacks is often high .\nEach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilian fatalities in a single civilian harm incident .\nCivilians have been reported killed by Russian forces in both large-scale civilian harm incidents and more consistently in smaller-scale harm events that are rarely covered by international media .\nMost civilian harm incidents involve allegations where between one and 10 civilians are reported killed , although several mass casualty incidents have also been attributed to Russian actions .\nAs widely documented by conflict monitors , civilian casualties are more likely to occur when actors target populated areas , especially when using explosive weapons with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there are at least 299 civilian harm incidents in Syria where local sources have alleged that \u2018 vacuum \u2019 missiles have been used by Russian forces : a particularly deadly explosive that can suck the oxygen from the air and cause a blast wave so massive it can destroy even reinforced infrastructure .\nThese incidents account for up to 1,480 alleged civilian fatalities .\nLocation of incidents referencing use of vacuum missiles during the Battle of Aleppo \u2013 2016 .\nIn the campaign to capture Aleppo in 2016 , Russian forces were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times on the densely populated city , according to Airwars monitoring of hyperlocal sources .\nWhile vacuum missiles are not banned under international law , their deliberate use on civilian neighbourhoods is prohibited .\nRussian forces have also been accused of using prohibited \u2018 cluster \u2019 bombs \u2013 munitions that have a large and inaccurate blast radius , and are likely to cause significant harm beyond the intended target .\nIn 567 civilian harm incidents recorded in the Airwars archive , local sources reported that cluster munitions have been used \u2013 accounting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7,040 civilian injuries .\nWithin the first three months of Russian attacks in Syria in late 2015 , Airwars found that local reports of civilian harm were already indicating a clear trend of systematic attacks on civilian neighbourhoods and vital infrastructure .\nLocal communities and civil society organisations , such as the Syrian Network for Human Rights , have continued to report on and document this major trend .\nOn February 27th 2022 , less than a week after Vladimir Putin \u2019 s invasion of Ukraine , local activists described \u201c massive destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Afes in Idlib province ; up to two people were killed and another four injured in the action attributed both to Russian forces and the Syrian regime .\nThis is one of 204 unique incidents in the Airwars archive where Russian forces were locally blamed for civilian harm in an attack on a marketplace ; in total these incidents account for up to 3,051 civilian fatalities .\nWhile it is not unusual for belligerents monitored by Airwars to harm civilians in attacks which strike marketplaces , our data indicates that Russian forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far higher rate than most .\nOur monitoring of alleged civilian harm resulting from US-led Coalition actions in Syria , for example , finds that despite similarly intensive campaigns conducted predominantly by airstrikes , US-led Coalition actions led to claimed civilian harm events in marketplaces on forty occasions .\nOf those events , Airwars presently assesses that 23 incidents did likely result from Coalition bombings .\nThe alliance itself has also publicly conceded civilian deaths and injuries in six of those marketplace attacks \u2013 a clear contrast with Moscow \u2019 s ongoing refusal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign .\nRussian forces in Syria , along with the Syrian regime , have also been accused of repeatedly attacking medical facilities , hospitals , and clinics throughout Syria with explosive munitions .\nOverall , our research identified 229 incidents where civilian harm reportedly occurred in medical facilities following alleged Russian and/or Syrian regime actions .\nIn many incidents , local sources reported \u201c total destruction \u201d of facilities \u2013 without any possibility of reconstruction .\nOther civilian spaces have also been hit during Russia \u2019 s campaign ; in at least 180 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatalities and injuries occured in schools .\nEducational facilities have frequently been the site of reported Russian incidents , including universities , where at least two attacks struck campuses , including the University of Ebla .\nOn January 21st 2018 , one civilian was reported to have been killed when Russian \u201c heavy aerial bombardment \u201d struck the university .\nOn the same day there were 15 additional raids on the area which further damaged the University buildings .\nLocal reporting also reveals at least 53 cases where civilians were reported killed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stations .\nIn 2016 alone , eight attacks on factories and twelve attacks on water stations were reported ; most of these were part of a major regime-led campaign to gain control of Aleppo city .\nIn one incident on September 23rd 2016 , up to 250,000 people in eastern Aleppo were reported to have temporarily lost access to water completely , when an air raid on the neighbourhood of Bab al Nayrab hit a water pumping station .\nAs Russian forces and their Syrian regime allies have closed in on the final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructure continues to come under attack .\nFrom September 2021 until January of this year , civilian harm incidents have been reported resulting from attacks on poultry farms at least twice a month .\nOverall , despite the lower tempo of the conflict in 2021 , it was also the year that saw the most attacks on farming facilities .\nIn 12 cases identified in our datasets , civilians were harmed in incidents where Russia was accused of targeting humanitarian response efforts \u2013 often in conjunction with the Syrian regime .\nIn four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after attacks on food convoys .\nIn the first of these cases , on November 25th 2015 , eight civilians were reported killed , including a child , when Russian planes hit a series of trucks close to the Turkish border .\nRussia accepted responsibility for the attack , but did not accept responsibility for the civilian casualties \u2013 and denied that the trucks were part of a humanitarian convoy .\nPotential implications of Russia \u2019 s actions in Syria for Ukraine Airwars has actively monitored , assessed and preserved all community-reported civilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since September 2015 \u2013 resulting in a major public database that presently runs to 650,000 words .\nOur detailed findings are clear .\nCivilian harm from Russia \u2019 s actions in Syria has been both extensive and continuous .\nCivilian neighbourhoods are routinely targeted by both air and artillery strikes , often with no suggestion of the presence of armed rebels .\nMarketplaces , hospitals , schools , critical infrastructure , and first responders , are also routinely struck .\nIndeed the frequency of such attacks compared to those of other actors in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia deliberately and routinely targets both civilians and civilian infrastructure , as part of a broader strategy to drive civilians from rebel-held areas .\nMany of the profoundly concerning and potentially unlawful Russian actions in Syria \u2013 which Airwars and others have extensively documented \u2013 are now reportedly being witnessed at scale across Ukraine , with multiple towns and cities under direct attack .\nIndeed , with the addition of tens of thousands of Russian ground forces and weapon systems never deployed in Syria \u2013 such as guided missile strikes and MRLS salvoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilian harm in Ukraine than that extensively documented for Syria .\nMoscow \u2019 s extensive ongoing attacks on urban centres \u2013 where millions of Ukrainians remain trapped \u2013 is particularly concerning .\nAccording to United Nations monitors , the great majority of civilian deaths and injuries result from the use of wide area effect explosive weapons on urban areas .\nUpcoming UN-brokered talks in Geneva to restrict the urban use of such weapons offer a clear opportunity for other nations to distance themselves from Russia \u2019 s outrageous actions .", "author": "Georgia Edwards", "url":

18 more civilians in Iraq and Syria and injuring a further 11 , its first such public concession in eight months .\nOn March 10th , Operation Inherent Resolve ( OIR ) \u2013 the US-led coalition against the so-called Islamic State \u2013 quietly released on its website its first public civilian harm assessment since July 2021 .\nIt assessed a total of 63 incidents dating back to 2015 , of

incidents to its own archive , Airwars put the likely casualty numbers far higher for these events , with between 45 and 166 civilians reportedly killed .\nThe remaining 53 incidents were deemed \u2018 non-credible.\n\u2019 Unlike previous Coalition announcements on civilian harm , there was no accompanying public press statement or social media commentary .\nIn a phone call to Airwars , CENTCOM confirmed it had published the information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came after US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had ordered a comprehensive review into US military civilian harm processes following intense media scrutiny .\nAs the Coalition itself noted in its opening paragraph , \u201c this report is released as part of the commitment by the U.S. government to increased transparency and accountability.\n\u201d In total since the beginning of the war against ISIS in 2014 , OIR has assessed 3,034 incidents of reported civilian harm from its air and artillery strikes .\nThe alliance has only conceded 360 of these events to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Airwars analysis .\nWhile the Coalition now concedes killing , overall , at least 1,437 civilians in its long war against the Islamic State , Airwars believes the likely tally is in fact at least 8,192 to 13,243 civilians killed .\nCivilian harm assessments released by the US-led Coalition were published monthly for a number of years , although they have significantly dropped in frequency since 2020 .\nLast year , only seven such reports were released \u2013 four of them in the month of July .\nThis was the first report @ @ @ @ @ @

, to an incident within Airwars \u2019 own database .\nIn only two of the eight events in the Airwars database admitted by CENTCOM did its own civilian casualty estimates match the public record .\nIn

year old brother Faddawi was killed in the attack , had briefly left her cousin \u2019 s home when the strike happened .\nAs she later told Amnesty \u201c we were together and then I went to my

.\nNow , four years later , the Coalition has conceded that eight civilians \u201c were unintentionally killed due to their proximity to the strike.\n\u201d A further 53 incidents in the new report were assessed or reassessed by the Coalition to be \u2018 non-credible.\n\u2019 A range of reasons are usually given for such categorisation , including \u2018 no strikes were conducted in the

result of a Coalition strike \u201d .\nAlong with basic information about each incident , the Coalition \u2019 s own assessments also included an MGRS code , a military variation of latitude and longitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geolocate where each incident is alleged to have happened .\nAirwars found that at least one of the \u2018 non credible \u2019 incidents had a location code in Turkey , indicating an error .\nOne of the \u2018 credible \u2019 incidents in the new report , in Baghouz , Syria in March 2019 , had previously been rejected twice by the Coalition as \u2018 non-credible

finalised and ratified by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Nations process , the EWIPA proceedings are backed heavily by the UN ; and Secretary General Antonio Guterres has repeatedly called for countries to adopt a strong protocol .\nDuring three days of talks in Geneva , representatives from attending countries will pore over the draft resolution and try to agree on key sections of text .\nMuch of the focus will likely be on winning the support of those states which have previously attempted to water down the declaration \u2019 s language , including the United States , the United Kingdom @ @ @ @ @

@ @ @ @ @ UK and others to water down the political declaration would make it effectively useless critics warn \u2013 and crucially , would not lead to changes in the way that states actually approach the use of explosive weapons in cities .\nThe draft resolution being discussed at Geneva consists of two parts \u2013 a preamble , which lays out the framework and overall considerations ; and the operative section , which effectively compels states to act .\nFor example , the value of tracking civilian casualties in real-time are currently mentioned in the preamble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operative section \u2013 though some states are pushing for it to be moved there .\nBroadly speaking , those attending the political declaration talks can be split into two camps : those states that argue the

states called on Russia to cease its aggression and indiscriminate bombing of civilians and it was noted multiple times that Russia \u2019 s campaign has targeted and destroyed civilian neighbourhoods using wide area effect explosive weapons \u2013 referring to the scenes of destruction in Kherson , Mariupol , and Kharkiv .\n2 .\nThe gap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 IHL does not go far enough \u2019 Broadly the delegates and countries fall into two groups \u2013 those that believe international humanitarian law ( IHL ) is enough to protect civilians under attack in urban areas \u2013 and those that argue more is needed to protect civilians .\nStates such as the USA , UK , France and Israel argued that any political declaration could not introduce new legal requirements ( which it can not ) and that the requirements currently set out under IHL should be sufficient protection for civilians .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ that deliberately attacking civilians and civilian infrastructure constitutes a violation of IHL \u2013 and that any military actions must be both proportionate , and distinguish between civilians and combatants .\nThose backing strong wording to the political declaration text \u2013 from Ireland to the ICRC \u2013 insist that adherence to IHL alone is not doing enough to protect civilians during much urban fighting .\nThe US nevertheless called on those states gathered not to produce an \u201c unrealistic impression \u201d that civilians would not be harmed in conflict , while emphasising that explosive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawful means of warfare when used in accordance with IHL.\n\u201d But other states , as well as civil society organisations such as Human Rights Watch , emphasised that any resolution which merely restated the value of IHL \u2013 and how states must abide by it \u2013 would effectively be useless , as it would be an iteration of what states have already committed to .\nStates such as Finland and Sweden remarked that there are gaps within IHL around EWIPA , and mere compliance with IHL is not enough to protect civilians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during previous consultations , and continues to be a major fault line .\nThe particularities of the language used in the eventual political declaration are at the heart of the ongoing consultations in Geneva \u2013 with discussions about whether to \u201c avoid \u201d or \u201c restrict \u201d the use of explosive weapons in populated areas already a key sticking point .\nAn additional area of tension appears to the so-called \u201c reverberating effects \u201d of EWIPA , which are essentially the long-term effects .\nAn example of a reverberating effect would be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it has the immediate effect of removing a crucial piece of civilian infrastructure .\nBut even after the conflict finishes the destruction could also mean that people can \u2019 t travel across a certain river , making it harder to access other kinds of civilian infrastructure such as hospitals or schools .\nThese long-term impacts were the subject of much discussion on Wednesday \u2013 with some states , such as the US , Israel , and the UK all noting that \u2018 reverberating effects \u2019 is neither a legal term nor \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a clear definition .\nThe US also said it would not accept a \u2018 novel \u2019 term such as reverberating effects in the eventual political declaration .\nHowever , civil society organisations such as PAX and observer states such as the Vatican suggested that it would be difficult to meaningfully understand the full implications of how civilian populations were impacted without incorporating \u2018 reverberating \u2019 effects .\nThe Holy See opened its own remarks by noting that it believes conventional weapons should be named \u201c weapons of mass displacement , \u201d a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that explosive weapons can have .\nThe Danish Refugee Council also noted that the use of EWIPA can contribute to displacement , and in time , continuously produce forms of renewed displacement .\nSome other states such as Uruguay emphasised the need to collect and monitor the impacts of EWIPA on specific groups \u2013 such as those with disabilities , or those who face discrimination because of their gender .\nOrganisations such as CIVIC , PAX and Humanity and Inclusion also spoke about the psychological and mental effects of the use of explosive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survivor-centric approach to any kind of political declaration .\nWhile the political declaration is primarily a matter between states , the UK , Israel , the US and others asked that the considerations around EWIPA must also extend to non-state actors , such as armed groups , in the interest of maintaining what they termed a balanced account of how explosive weapons are actually used in populated areas .\nThe US noted for example that \u201c the declaration has to make it clear that all belligerents , including non-state armed groups , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilians and civilian objects.\n\u201d The Turkish delegation argued that asking non-state actors to really consider these impacts would also mean they would be considered as legitimate parties to an international armed conflict \u2013 which they are currently , for the most part , not .", "author": "Joe Dyke", "url":

casualties in Ukraine \u2013 an interview with the UN Monitoring Mission", "content": "Airwars speaks to Uladzimir Shcherbau , head of the UN civilian casualty monitoring team in Ukraine , on the challenges of tracking civilian deaths .\nBeginning in 2014 , the United Nations Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has been tasked with recording civilian casualties in that country .\nUntil February 24th , the conflict was relatively low intensity .\nRussia \u2019 s invasion and subsequent attacks on communities across a swathe of Ukraine saw a huge rise in reported civilian deaths , which the UN Mission continues to track .\nWith the Ukraine Government ceasing its own public national estimates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , the UN \u2019 s own daily cumulative tallies have become the sole official source for national casualty estimates .\nBy early April , the UN had recorded at least 1,500 civilian deaths \u2013 while also publicly acknowledging that was likely a significant undercount .\nUladzimir Shcherbau joined the UN Monitoring Mission in Ukraine back in 2014 , and today leads its civilian casualty monitoring unit .\nAlmost all of the team remains in Ukraine \u2013 some close to the front lines \u2013 and all of them doing extremely challenging work .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chris Woods conducted on April 1st , Uladzimir discusses among other topics the challenges of UN casualty counting following Russia \u2019 s invasion ; how the Mission plans to address its own low estimates of harm ; and the horrors of Russia \u2019 s onslaught on the Ukrainian city of Mariupol .\nWhat \u2019 s the purpose of the UN gathering civilian casualty data ?\nWhy do we do it ?\nIt \u2019 s not just about gathering data .\nWe have three or four major objectives , to which the information we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision making by military and political actors \u2013 ideally to facilitate the cessation of hostilities , and definitely compliance with International Humanitarian Law ( IHL ) .\nWhen we see the patterns of IHL violations \u2013 it is not our major objective , and very often in such contexts it is very difficult to establish whether the civilian was the result of IHL incompliance or in the worst cases of war crimes \u2013 but surely some of our findings would inform the deeper investigations and we do work deeply in some incidents \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIdeally we go really deep into each single civilian killed , we establish as an ideal minimum the date of the incident , the status of the victim killed or injured , then if possible the name of the victim , then the age , definitely sex , place where it happened \u2013 as precisely as possible , if not geographic coordinates \u2013 then ideally the settlement or a specific area .\nThen control over the area \u2013 which party controlled the area \u2013 and then the weapon and the situation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only record civilian casualties , not military casualties .\nWhen we have the slightest hesitation that a person might have been Directly Participating in Hostilities , we don \u2019 t include them in our figures .\nIn the current context I would put it like this .\nBecause the amount of material we have to process is enormous and the time constraints are also enormous , we can not go too deeply into each individual incident .\nI would describe this as \u2018 temporary superficiality \u2019 .\nHow is UN civilian harm monitoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the team ?\nAnd are you still able to operate ?\nMost of the team is located in Ukraine in various places \u2013 not in the places where the hostilities are going on but in other places , sometimes nearby , which allows us to reach out to Internally Displaced Persons ( IDPs ) , to people who evacuated from the conflict-torn areas , and to get access to first hand witnesses and victims .\nAnd we are still physically present in Donetsk and Luhansk , which Russian-affiliated armed groups control .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2014 and 2017 respectively , and we are still physically present in Donetsk , with certain restrictions on our operations there , and also those stemming from the security situation .\nWe have 37 human rights officers and several interns who have been working on monitoring and to a certain extent everyone is engaged in civilian casualty recording as well .\nBut dedicated work on civilian harm is done by a small unit which I am in charge of .\nHow have you been able to continue this critical work following Russia \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the global [ UN ] guidance on how to record civilian casualties and it is fairly simple \u2013 we collect information from the best sources we can , preferably at least three independent sources and then based on the body of information we collected , we assess the sources based on their credibility and reliability .\nWe also follow the patterns of violations which also allow us to assess , to verify , and to corroborate \u2013 so we collect a lot of information about the hostilities in general which also allow us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Basically we have three or four types of information .\nDefinitely we take stock of all available official information \u2013 local authorities , national authorities , regional authorities , medical institutions , emergency services , police , very often military experts and some others \u2013 any state official or a person working in a facility who has some information on casualties .\nWe take stock of all the information they provide .\nWe often reach out with requests for specific information but in the current context we see that the state agencies are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they don \u2019 t have time to respond to our questions .\nBut they do still report on civilian casualties \u2013 for example giving totals per region .\nNot only figures but we also receive a lot of descriptive narrative for specific incidents .\nAnd when someone says \u2018 ok there was an incident in settlement X and there were a lot of civilian casualties \u2019 , in our records , as you can understand , it would be recorded as zero casualties unless we can understand the specific incident .\nBut we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is extremely valuable , and we do analyse it systematically .\nSo we have a mosaic of all these official reports .\nWithin weeks we saw which of these authorities provide consistently reliable information , and those which unfortunately are giving extremely vague information based on plausible assumptions and these assumptions do not get additional credibility simply because they are made by an official .\nThey are definitely free to make any assumptions or judgements based on intuitive thinking but we clearly see in some cases it is not factually based .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicly available information on these incidents .\nIn that regard the situation in Ukraine is extremely transparent \u2013 available through publicly available sources \u2013 Telegram , Facebook , Internet .\nRoughly speaking , we are talking about a lot of video footage , a lot of photos , and a lot of narrative reports .\nThe number of channels in which people report is enormous .\nWe do systematically follow as much as we can on these channels \u2013 very often it \u2019 s a local channel for a specific village or something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is besieged and the situation is really bad and information is imprecise \u2013 people are reporting per quarter what happened in a specific house or area .\nWe use all this information for our analysis and we collect it systematically .\nThen there is our outreach to informed individuals .\nWe had , for example , developed a broad network of contacts prior to the present high intensity conflict .\nAll our offices and field presence were mostly in the east of Ukraine .\nAnd we are reaching out to these people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI will give you just one example \u2013 we had a trusted partner NGO which had worked a lot in the east and there were for instance two towns in the Lugansk region which were well known to those who follow Ukrainian events .\nShastiya and Staniska-Uganska .\nAnd there were hostilities from the very beginning there , and the NGO reached out to medical professionals working in the area to get very detailed medical records about casualties .\nSo we use this network of contacts .\nThey proactively provide us with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide us with some information .\nAnd finally , we also publicly announced that we are interested in receiving information about civilian casualties \u2013 and so people send us information through Telegram , Facebook and by email .\nWe can not cover it ( fully ) as we don \u2019 t have the capacity but we increasingly interview IDPs from the conflict affected areas \u2013 and also receive first hand accounts of individual incidents in which civilians were killed or injured .\nSo altogether we collect this information systematically \u2013 not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three weeks ago .\nIf there is a ( new ) photo of a grave with the names on it from the town recently retaken by Ukrainian forces we go back to the records and check the names .\nAll of that together .\nThen we analyse this information , and once we come to conclusions that we have reasonable grounds to believe it happened , then it goes to our figures \u2013 the case is corroborated .\nIt doesn \u2019 t mean we have all the information \u2013 maybe we don \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or something \u2013 but we still believed it happened and it goes into our figures .\nThose cases which have not yet reached this stage we call \u2018 yellow cases \u2019 , which are still pending further verification and corroboration and we have many such cases which are in the process of corroboration .\nSome of them could stay marked as pending corroboration for months , if not years , some of them could be corroborated tomorrow if new information comes .\nSo we are always reassessing such cases and seeing if anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mosaic \u2013 sometimes you get new information , and the puzzle comes together and a case becomes corroborated .\nThis is how we do it .\nThe volume of casework you are dealing with must be staggering .\nWhat adjustments have you had to make ?\nIt is not a dramatic shift compared to what we did before .\nWe did roughly the same from 2014-2021 \u2013 the only thing was the intensity of hostilities was much lower starting from 2015 and we then had the luxury ( of ) following each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place , speaking to the people , getting forensic records etc And today ?\nLet \u2019 s say there is a report of an airstrike in Kiev with reported civilian casualties .\nThen we take note of this report .\nThen the city council says it was a centre for the distribution of humanitarian aid and 20 people have been killed on the spot \u2013 without specifying whether they were civilians or militants .\nThat \u2019 s ok but it is not enough for us .\nThen video footage becomes available , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies of people who appear to be civilians , some of them women , some can \u2019 t be identified but they don \u2019 t look like military or paramilitary .\nAnd there are also some people in the local chat groups saying a \u2018 horrible thing happened in this street and I was there and it was a Hell.\n\u2019 So once again having analysed all this information we believe we have reasonable grounds to believe that the incident happened , and the overall context that the city was under fire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the General Staff is reporting that there was heavy shelling of this city , we have records from previous days that this area is being targeted , probably we will get some satellite imagery showing the neighbourhood affected .\nWe can reach out to our partner in that area and ask if there was something and they might say \u201c I don \u2019 t know what happened , I was 5km from that place , but there was something horrible.\n\u201d And then , we say we saw five bodies .\nWe don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we don \u2019 t write 20 , we write five people were killed in that incident \u2013 including perhaps one man and two women \u2013 on that day .\nThis is roughly how we arrive at a conclusion , but once again it depends on the situation From our experience usually reports of civilian casualties are not fake \u2013 sometimes there could be deliberate attempts to present certain incidents , to portray the other side as a perpetrator .\nBut it is so easy to debunk such fakes so I don \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are accurate , there could be some sort of natural imprecision or mistakes \u2013 very often when you receive a report about a civilian and the name \u2013 how the family name is spelled may not be found in the registration of population .\nBut then you realise this family name is accurate \u2013 it was just a ( spelling ) mistake in the report \u2013 and you realise it \u2019 s indirect evidence that the report is authentic , because most likely the report was made on the phone and the person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ didn \u2019 t hear it properly .\nCivilians have been urged by some to take up arms during the present conflict and to Directly Participate in Hostilities .\nHow does that affect categorisations for you , when you \u2019 re making a determination of civilian harm ?\nMethodologically it is fairly simple \u2013 civilians are those who don \u2019 t take direct participation in hostilities .\nYou don \u2019 t have to be a member of the armed forces or paramilitary formations to be counted as not a civilian \u2013 it could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arms to fight .\nAs soon as you directly participate in hostilities you are not a civilian any more .\nIf such people are killed or injured we exclude them from the UN count .\nThere could be some marginal cases where there could be questions and you can not be 100 % sure how to classify this person as a civilian or not , but statistically these cases are extremely insignificant and for methodological purity we exclude such debatable questions from civilian casualties .\nAnd we have a fairly clear definition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is performing regular police functions in the conflict zone and is killed or injured by hostilities and he or she is not taking part in hostilities \u2013 just patrolling the area in the conflict zone when he or she was killed or injured by shelling \u2013 we consider them a civilian casualty .\nIf a police officer is present in a conflict zone to maintain law and order as part of enhanced police deployment , and basically also controlling the area recently taken under control , or doing some sort of paramilitary function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilian any more .\nWe even excluded cases which could be very marginal \u2013 for instance if there is a military unit which is stationed in a certain location and there is a civilian who regularly brings some food to this unit \u2013 maybe paid or not , but somehow helps them to sustain .\nIt is easy to argue that this person is not taking part in hostilities but we exclude such cases .\nStatistically such cases are marginal but we exclude even very marginal cases so probably decreasing the toll a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s pretty clear whether a person participates in hostilities or not .\nWhat is the situation for civilian harm in breakaway and Russian-occupied areas ?\nHow able are you to capture that ?\nFor us it doesn \u2019 t make any difference \u2013 we are covering the entire territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders , and we do follow all the reports and do our best to corroborate all civilian casualties wherever they happen .\nAnd we do it in regard to territory controlled by the Russian-affiliated armed groups or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Russian armed forces .\nWe have certain difficulties in getting the information but it is roughly the same as getting the information from government-controlled territories .\nWe also do breakdowns for Donetsk and Luhansk regions , for government controlled territory , and for territory controlled by Russian affiliated armed groups .\nWe haven \u2019 t yet published figures from the places which had been controlled by Russian Armed Forces \u2013 say from the Kharkiv or Chernihiv or Kherson regions .\nBut we are also coming with those figures fairly soon .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock of all civilian casualties , including in the territory which is presently outside of Ukrainian government control .\nIn your own daily press releases you are very clear that the true casualty figure is likely much higher .\nHow wide a gulf might there be between UN estimates and the actual civilian toll ?\nI wish we had this interview in the next week or two .\nWe are working right now on a realistic estimate of the actual death toll of the conflict .\nWe have a big mass of information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approximate the actual death toll .\nI wouldn \u2019 t give you specific figures right now because it is extremely sensitive and we are under enormous pressure because we are criticised heavily \u2013 they are saying \u2018 your figures are irrelevant .\nIt \u2019 s nice that you give these at least figures but they are irrelevant because the real death toll is higher \u2019 as we ourselves point out in our daily updates .\nBut we have data , we have information , we have a really solid methodology \u2013 it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at patterns , correlations , available information per region and per type of casualties to come ( up ) with this realistic estimate and once again we will soon come up with an estimate fairly soon .\nWe believe it would be pretty accurate .\nThe figure would be fairly reflective of the actual scale \u2013 it will be also conservative , not to go too broad , but we believe it will be fairly close to the actual death toll .\nAll in all we would come with a rather accurate total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual total and real total would not be so big .\nWe believe we will give a gist of what the scale is \u2013 of the true scale we believe of the casualties \u2013 especially of those killed .\nLow UN estimates have been cited to downplay deadly effects of Russia \u2019 s invasion .\nThe city of Mariupol reports more than 5,000 civilian deaths so far .\nWhat do you make of that estimate ?\nWhen we speak about Mariupol , it is definitely the deadliest place in Ukraine currently .\nWe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the city council \u2013 we do follow the data they provided and we requested additional data and they committed to providing us as much as they can , but they have been working in extremely challenging conditions as you can understand .\nEven so , they estimate 5,000 civilian deaths from just three weeks of hostilities in March .\nOur own UN estimate should come hopefully fairly soon as we managed to collect information about Mariupol , we analysed all the narrative reports , official figures and official reports from medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also some information which allows us to see the pattern from emergency services and video footage .\nWe also do satellite imagery analysis \u2013 not only on damage .\nSo we hope to come with a rather realistic , from our perspective , estimate .\nThe amount of conflict death is enormous , but also surely people kept dying in besieged Mariupol because of regular mortality , many people died as indirect casualties because of stress and the collapse of medical aid .\nAnd reportedly many suicides have occured in Mariupol .\nWe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicide rates increased , that \u2019 s for sure .\nSo it needs also to be factored in that all these people died during this one month of hostilities \u2013 though the UN Mission ourselves strive to single out the civilians who have been directly killed by hostilities , and we will come up with our estimate pretty soon .\nGiven this scale of harm , how long might it be before the UN has a comprehensive tally of civilian deaths at Mariupol ?\nWhen will the world know for sure when hostilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have been killed in Mariupol from day one until the last day of hostilities ?\nThat will surely take time .\nIt will take time to recover all the bodies , to identify them , and because there was a mass displacement for example , some people who were evacuated from Mariupol , some injured people who could have died in medical facilities outside of Mariupol .\nSo the ultimate accurate figure won \u2019 t arrive quickly .\nWe have credible reports that there are still many bodies in the debris .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 no one was ( able ) to take care of the bodies .\nMany bodies have been buried in improvised graves \u2013 they also need to be exhumed and reburied individually and with proper decency .\nThat will also be an enormous challenge for the city .\nWe have seen a lot of footage of graves in peoples \u2019 yards , which is appalling .\nSo we will analyse all the information and try to come up with our own estimate but surely for the future that will be a horrible and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , but to ensure decent treatment of those who perished .\nAnd then once again to work for reparations and bring the perpetrators to justice .\nThe preservation of evidence \u2013 which is what dead bodies are \u2013 will be extremely essential .", "author": "Chris Woods", "url":

edge towards explosive weapons deal", "content": "International gathering brings nearer a protocol on restricting explosive weapon use in urban areas .\nStates edged closer to a political declaration on the use of explosive weapons in populated areas on April 8th , after three days of crunch talks in Geneva .\nMore than 65 states descended on the Swiss city for key talks on the wording of a political declaration that advocates believe would save thousands of lives by restricting the use of wide area effect explosive weapons in populated areas ( EWIPA ) .\nDetractors , such as the United States government , argue it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military actions and have threatened not to sign .\nWhile no final text was agreed upon Friday , all sides struck an optimistic tone at the end of the three-day meet \u2013 saying a deal was nearer than ever .\nDelegates will meet again for one day in two months before an adoption ceremony expected in the summer .\n\u201c There are clearly differences of opinion but we have seen a very positive , solution oriented approach , \u201d the chairperson , Ambassador Michael Gaffey of Ireland , said .\n\u201c We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words in a political declaration \u2013 we want to make a real difference and impact on the ground and foster behavioural change.\n\u201d The talks were given additional urgency by the ongoing war in Ukraine , and Russia \u2019 s extensive use of explosive weapons on its cities .\nMoscow did not attend the talks .\nEven the United States , widely viewed as one of the most hostile states to a declaration with teeth , struck a more positive tone than in previous meets .\n\u201c There are still tough drafting issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get them right .\nThe US delegation pledges our goodwill , to help to get to a positive outcome .\nWe look forward to doing so.\n\u201d Since 2018 , Ireland has chaired consultations on the use of explosive weapons in populated areas .\nIn the sessions since , the need for such a declaration \u2013 which is not legally binding and so does not create new legal obligations \u2013 has only become clearer .\n\u201c The draft declaration text holds the potential to make a meaningful contribution to the protection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few days have overall been constructive , \u201d Laura Boillot of INEW , a network of NGOs pushing for the protocol , told Airwars .\n\u201c But decisions will now need to be made if the final text is going to have humanitarian effect .\nMost importantly it needs to establish a presumption against the use of explosive weapons with wide area effects in towns , cities and other populated areas.\n\u201d During three days of focused talks , several key fissures bubbled .\nWhile states in attendance \u2013 and civil society organisations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce a tangible and meaningful political declaration that could help save civilian lives on the ground , the practicalities of the process made clear that good intentions weren \u2019 t going to be enough .\nOn the first day of the informal consultations on April 6th , states made general remarks \u2013 affirming their support for the proceedings as well as their national positions \u2013 after an introductory statement from Ireland , the penholder .\nIn these general remarks , most states tended towards re-affirming the positions they had made clear in previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UK , US , Israel and Canada all emphasized that their positions as militarily active states meant that they would not sign a declaration in its current form , which included strong language about avoiding the use of explosive weapons in urban areas .\nThroughout the week , the delegates from these countries could often be seen meeting as a bloc outside of formal proceedings .\nMany of the sticking points that emerged on the first day continued to dominate both the main floor and side conversations .\nThe predominant line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the declaration needed only to reaffirm the importance of international humanitarian law and provide further guidance about how to do so in this context ; and those who asserted that this declaration needed to strengthen existing commitments and add new ones for states around the use of explosive weapons .\nThe second day of discussions took a more technical turn , with the majority of interventions focused on the wording of specific clauses and paragraphs of the text .\nClause 3.3 , which attracted much attention in previous consultations , was once again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first clauses in Section B , the operative section \u2013 which lays out the actions that states have to comply with if they choose to sign onto the declaration .\nIn the current draft , Clause 3.3 says states must : \u201c Ensure that our armed forces adopt and implement a range of policies and practices to avoid civilian harm , including by restricting or refraining from the use of explosive weapons with wide area effects in populated areas , when the effects may be expected to extend beyond a military objective.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ this clause was on the second sentence , as many states intervened on the use of \u201c restricting or refraining , \u201d with some suggesting it was strong enough while others lobbied instead for the use of \u201c avoid \u201d .\nA split between the majority of civil society organisations and militarily-powerful states was apparent during these parts of the discussions , with NGOs and international agencies pushing for stronger language , rather than trying to place limits on what kinds of civilian harm would be protected under this new declaration .\nAirwars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research Emily Tripp also made an intervention \u2013 emphasising how crucial it was for states to actually track civilian harm .\nAt the end of day two INEW , one of the organisers , named nine states \u2013 Belgium , Canada , Denmark , Israel , the Republic of Korea , Sweden , Turkey , the United Kingdom and the United States \u2013 that it said had \u201c worked to weaken declaration provisions.\n\u201d The UK delegation , for example , agreed that tracking civilian harm was a \u2018 moral obligation , \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed this was not feasible \u2013 arguing that live hostilities made it near impossible to monitor casualties properly .\nBut INEW also said that

northern Syria still seeking answers A year on from a devastating assault on the main hospital in the Syrian city of Afrin , a new Airwars visual investigation has pieced together key features of the attack .\nAt least 19 people were reportedly killed in two strikes on the Al-Shifa hospital on June 12th , 2021 in what was the single deadliest incident tracked by Airwars in Syria during 2021 .\nHospital attacks in Syria are sadly common , with both the Syrian government and allied Russian forces striking dozens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2011 .\nThe US-led Coalition against the so-called Islamic State , Turkey and Kurdish groups have also all been accused of targeting medical facilities .\nBut the Al-Shifa hospital strike was unusual in that the survivors didn \u2019 t all identify the same culprit .\nSome accused the Syrian regime , others the Russians , while others still blamed the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces or allied Kurdish militias .\nSome even claimed Turkey was responsible for an attack in a city under its influence .\nBy bringing together satellite imagery , CCTV footage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Airwars created a comprehensive visual assessment of the strike .\nWe were seeking to understand what munition was used and where the rocket was fired from .\nWhile the investigation was not able to definitively conclude which party was responsible , it did define a seven-kilometre wide region from where the rockets were likely launched .\nIn that area the Syrian regime , SDF and Russians all operated .\n\u201c We hope that by publishing this investigation on the anniversary of this horrific attack , we will spark a new conversation about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emily Tripp , Airwars \u2019 Director , said .\n\u201c This case is one of far too many in Syria \u2019 s long civil war where families are left seeking answers about who killed their loved ones.\n\u201d The full visual investigation is available here .\nAfrin is a geopolitically significant city \u2013 located at the forefront between multiple belligerents in the 11-year Syrian civil war .\nThe city is close to the Turkish border and is currently under the control of Turkish-backed groups that operate under the broad title of the Syrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has fought significant conflicts with Kurdish groups , including the SDF \u2013 the closest ally of the United States in Syria .\nThe SDF controls much of the territory to the east of Afrin .\nAt the time of the strike the Syrian government and its Russian backers also had military capabilities in the region , controlling territory to the southeast of Afrin , while also being known to operate in the east .\nRussian and Syrian government forces have been the most common strikers of hospitals during the civil war .\nAl-Shifa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city and is reportedly close to multiple Turkish government and SNA buildings .\nThe hospital is partly run by the Syrian American Medical Society ( SAMS ) .\nAt the time of the attack Turkish president Erodogan accused the SDF , who in turn accused Syrian government forces .\nAllegations were also made against Russian forces and even Turkey itself .\nMost investigations of this type begin by analysing the remnants of the missiles at the scene .\nHowever , according to medical sources on the ground , Turkish-backed authorities removed all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital in the hours after the attack , and also prevented activists and media from accessing the site for several hours .\nWithout these vital clues , we drew on other forms of evidence that might give us an idea of where the projectiles might have been launched from .\nAirwars compiled all available visual evidence , including drone footage , CCTV recordings provided by SAMS , social media posts , photographs and satellite imagery .\nWe also gathered witness testimony , including speaking to survivors .\nUsing this information we produced a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impact locations .\nThe first strike hit the alleyway of the emergency department at 6.55pm \u2013 CCTV footage captured the explosion before cutting out shortly after as the electricity failed .\nThe strike caused significant damage to buildings on both sides of the alleyway and reportedly killed , among others , a woman giving birth .\n\u201c It was terrifying .\nIt felt like an earthquake , \u201d medic Mohammed al-Aghawani , who was injured in the attack , told Airwars .\n\u201c At first I didn \u2019 t understand what had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead.\n\u201d The second strike , occurring a few seconds later , hit the main building and damaged the physiotherapy , paediatrics , ENT and surgical clinics .\nPhotographs of the second impact location show a metal rafter broken and bent in half by the projectile as it penetrated the wall .\nFrom this we determined that the projectile would have arrived at an angle perpendicular to the bend of the bar .\nPlotting this onto a wider map , we concluded that the projectile must have come from a near due easterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential launch area further , we extended our 3D model to map a third impact location allegedly from the same volley of projectiles .\nDr. Amin Qosho was at sitting at his kitchen table in his apartment home a few hundred metres away from the hospital .\nAround 7pm a projectile struck the building opposite his apartment .\nInstead of penetrating the wall , it hit the building \u2019 s reinforced elevator shaft , sending a large spread of shrapnel towards Qosho \u2019 s balcony and through his door , killing him instantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this impact location we were able to determine the relative height of the building struck and the building directly to the east .\nBuilding upon our previous determination that the projectile came from the east , we concluded that the angle of impact must have been high enough to clear the neighbouring building .\nTo narrow down our launch area further we investigated the munition used .\nWhile the Turkish-backed authorities removed all munitions remnants from the hospital itself , an image shared on social media that day showed a projectile found between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital .\nThe projectile was identified as a 122mm , fired from a BM21 GRAD rocket launcher .\nThis type of launcher was first developed by the Soviet Union in the 1960s but are now a very common \u2013 used by multiple sides in the Syrian war .\nSuch launchers fire up to 40 projectiles in a single volley and are inherently inaccurate \u2013 designed for open battle fields not urban warfare .\nWhile it was impossible to say with absolute certainty that the hospital and Qosho \u2019 s home were also hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were from the same volley of rockets .\nFiring tables for GRAD rockets give a typical range of between 5 and 20 kilometres .\nHowever , using our model we determined that to clear the top of the building to the east , the rocket would have had to enter at a minimum of 23.4 degrees .\nThis narrowed our potential launch area down further to between 12.3 and 20.5 kilometres .\nWe shared all our visual evidence with a leading world expert in GRAD rockets , Ove Dullum .\nHe agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction , adding that the fragment patterns from the impact indicated a low angle of impact , narrowly clearing the neighbouring building to the east .\nCompiling his analysis with our own findings we estimate that the rockets were likely fired from the east and within the closer half of our range .\nOther investigations have found that the same type of rockets have been launched from the same area , including one by @ obretix on a strike that hit the headquarters of a medical first responders organisation in Afrin six weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the time of the incident , our estimated launch area was mostly under control of the SDF , America \u2019 s closest ally in Syria , along with allied militia groups .\nHowever control of this region is complicated .\nReports in the weeks prior to the attack showed evidence of Russian and Syrian military forces operating within our estimated launch area .\nOn the 2nd of June , alleged Turkish artillery targeting SDF positions in Mara \u2019 anaz reportedly killed a Lieutenant in the Syrian militant , showing the presence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces in the area .\nTwo days prior to the Al-Shifa attack , three soldiers from the Syrian military were reportedly injured by alleged Turkish bombardment on Menagh airbase , located within our potential launch area .\nAs such official designation of responsibility remains unclear .\nThe SDF , Russians and Syrian Government all deny responsibility for this attack on a vital resource .\nFor the families of the victims and the survivors , the lack of accountability makes the suffering harder .\n\u201c I tried to check on the families of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very bad , \u201d Al-Aghawani said .\n\u201c Personally , every few nights I dream of bombing.\n\u201d Airwars invites anyone

steps - the focus now is on implementation and renewed efforts to ensure past cases are not forgotten .\nAirwars joins our civil society partners in welcoming the publication of the much awaited Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response Action Plan ( CHMR-AP ) , released yesterday by the US Department of Defense .\nThe CHMR-AP reflects a years-long process of sustained pressure by individuals , civil society , journalists , activists and legislators to challenge the way the US military conducts itself in the battlefield , and force the Department of Defense to review practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the globe \u2013 from the battles of Mosul and Raqqa in the war against ISIS , to the botched Kabul strike last year .\nIn response to this sustained pressure , catalysed by a series of Pulitzer-winning New York Times articles exposing serious concerns with US military practices in January 2022 , Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III issued a memorandum calling for the creation of the CHMR-AP .\nAustin called for the CHMR-AP to set up a process for the establishment of a new centre of excellence , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation and mitigation .\nThe 46-page document is an unprecedented move toward transparency , and was put together following a series of key engagements with civil society actors and independent specialists .\nPresenting a far reaching future-looking agenda , it is applicable to the \u2018 full spectrum of conflict \u2019 \u2013 from current operations , large and small , to any future situations of high-intensity conflict .\nCovering 11 distinct objectives \u2013 ranging from actions to reduce confirmation bias to implementation of a new data management system ; each with a proposed set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the CHMR-AP presents an ambitious set of actions that , if implemented appropriately , could present a radical departure from existing policy in some areas .\nIt sets a strong precedent for future US military action \u2013 and , importantly , an example for allies to follow .\nRead the DoD factsheet here and the full action plan here .\nWhy is the CHMR-AP so important ?\nWhile the action plan itself is focused on reviewing and reforming the US \u2019 policies on civilian harm mitigation and tracking , it should also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support the US in modern conflicts , such as the UK , France , Netherlands , Belgium , and others .\nAs it stands , US allies have been shown to have limited oversight , transparency , or accountability for civilian harm from their own actions .\nThe UK , for instance , admits to only a single civilian casualty from its 8 years of support to the anti-ISIS coalition in Iraq and Syria , in which the UK has been second only to the US in the number of munitions dropped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilians killed by this coalition could be well over 8,000 .\nOver the last few years , Airwars and our civil society partners have advocated with several of these states to review and improve national approaches and policies to civilian harm mitigation ; yet , while some states have taken on such reviews , none have been as far-reaching or ambitious as the CHMR-AP .\nBeyond these national processes to improve approaches to civilian harm mitigation , the CHMR-AP also comes out in the context of a new international agreement on the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to be signed by the US and key allies in October this year .\nThe CHMR-AP \u2019 s introduction of the term \u2018 civilian environment \u2019 presents a broad understanding of civilian harm \u2013 with reference to the need to understand population density , urban systems and the \u2018 the interconnected relationships between the civilian population , natural resources , infrastructure , and essential services \u2019 .\nThis is an important move towards acknowledging the long-term consequences of military action on civilians caught in conflict .\nWhat does this mean for civilians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nPerhaps the biggest gap in the CHMR-AP is that it includes no reference to reviewing past cases of alleged civilian harm ; including addressing the 37 cases that are still open pending assessment for civilian harm claims made against the US-led Coalition in the war against ISIS .\nAccording to Airwars \u2019 archive , the likely death toll resulting from the actions of the US-led Coalition \u2019 s actions in the war against ISIS alone could be at least 8,192 and as many as 13,247 civilians .\nThe US has conceded causing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but has rejected 2,674 harm claims .\nThese rejected cases could account for thousands of casualties .\nTotal estimates for the last twenty years of US actions reach as many as 48,308 civilian deaths \u2013 with over 90,000 declared strikes across seven major conflict zones throughout the so-called \u2018 forever wars \u2019 .\nKey questions therefore remain unanswered : will the remaining open cases be reviewed ?\nWill they be reviewed with this new policy in mind ?\nHow might the new policy change the outcome of those investigations ?\nAnd if these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new policies \u2013 what does that mean for the cases that have previously been rejected as \u2018 non-credible \u2019 under a system that has now been widely acknowledged to have been in need of reform ?\nLooking back at past cases has significant implications for commitments to amends processes \u2013 a section outlined as an objective in the CHMR-AP , although with no mention of how the new action plan would affect outstanding claims or clear detail on implementation of future processes .\nWhat should we be looking out for now ?\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhile the action plan outlines a comprehensive set of actions and resource plans , it is yet to be determined the extent to which the policy will be implemented effectively and with continued consultation with independent voices .\nThis is particularly important as US actions are on-going across the globe \u2013 Airwars has recorded an uptick in strikes in Somalia since Biden announced his decision to redeploy troops in May this year , while a new set of strikes were announced in Syria on Iran-backed militants just as the CHMR-AP was released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rights Watch Washington Director Sarah Yager in a comment to CNN , the staffing and resources required must be arranged as soon as possible in order to ensure that \u201c the principles and values behind doing this are deeply embedded in the Pentagon \u201d , before any significant leadership change in the US administration , which could delay or even derail current plans for improvements .\nAllies of the US should also take notice \u2013 and take action .\nParticularly with key sections of the CHMR-AP including reference to the application of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US allies will have to review their own practices .\nSeveral crucial points in the action plan are also still lacking clarity , and it will likely be some time before the full extent of the policy has been reviewed in its entirety by experts .\nAirwars is coordinating closely with our civil society partners in the US to ensure a comprehensive and thorough review of the proposed action plan , in order to ensure appropriate oversight and support from civil society as the action plan enters into the next phase of implementation @", "author": "Emily Tripp", "url":

end of last year , reporting from Azmat Khan at the New York Times drew renewed attention in international media to the range of issues around how civilian casualties were assessed by the US in Iraq

accountability and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracking throughout the so-called \u2018 forever wars \u2019 .\nIn last year \u2019 s annual report , Airwars and others raised serious concerns with the 2020 annual casualty admissions \u2013 noting that reporting from other sources placed the civilian death toll at five times higher than the numbers admitted by the DoD .\nIn its 2021 report , the Department of

.\nIt is unclear if the remaining open cases mentioned in the annual report include the two cases previously noted as open by CENTCOM earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were at least 15 additional cases alleging harm resulting from US actions carried out in Syria throughout 2021 .\nUS military actions in Syria in 2021 primarily included support to local ally the Syrian Democratic Forces ( SDF ) in

2021 annual report continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of significant discrepancies between conceded casualties and local allegations throughout this campaign ; more so even than in other \u2013 more contested \u2013 battlegrounds , such as the Battle of Mosul .\nIn total \u2013 the US has conceded just 3 % of even the most conservative estimates of civilian harm reported during the Battle of Deir Ezzor ; compared with over a third of casualties alleged in the Battle of Mosul , for example .\nAirwars puts the minimum likely estimate of deaths during this campaign at 695 , while the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those now conceded in the annual report .\nNotably , this is the first time that the March 18th incident has been officially confirmed in public reporting by DoD \u2013 the incident was rejected previously as \u2018 non-credible \u2019 twice by OIR ; with an assessment reopened only after widespread media attention on the case at the end of last year .\nLocal sources have alleged at least 160 civilian fatalities resulted from the strike , including up to 45 children .\nIn May this year , General Garrett \u2013 the four-star general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the case \u2013 rejected almost all allegations of wrong-doing by US military forces during the operation .\nHis investigation , which was kept classified apart from the Executive Summary , concluded that nearly all those killed were

AFRICOM that no civilians had been harmed in the strike , which took place in January 2021 , in its first quarterly report last year AFRICOM admitted that three civilians had been \u2018 inadvertently injured \u2019 when US forces conducted an air strike on what was reported to be an al-Shabaab radio station .\nThe US has carried out at least 254 raids or airstrikes in Somalia since 2007 , and has acknowledged five civilian deaths throughout this period .\nAirwars own research puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhile the 2021 figure aligns with public reporting , it should be noted that there are significant challenges with harm documentation in Somalia given the security environment .\nThis year \u2019 s annual report references the recently released Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response Action Plan ( CHMR-AP ) in part to explain any potential discrepancies between DoD admissions and public reporting .\nThe annual report acknowledges that \u201c specific processes for reviewing or

number to the initial signatories to other international declarations that have created new norms and standards in warfare , such as the Safe Schools Declaration .\nAmong the signatories to the EWIPA declaration are states such as the US , UK , Netherlands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sizable contributions to the coalition against ISIS in Iraq and Syria that killed an estimated 8,194\u201313,249 civilians .\nAccording to Action on Armed Violence , when EWIPAs are used , over 90 % of those harmed are civilians .\nAirwars recently put together a series of maps showing the clear and troubling connection between population density in cities and civilian deaths during urban warfare .\nEven beyond those who are killed immediately , the reverberating effects are often severe and pervasive , with schools , hospitals , livelihoods , and basic resources like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis has played out in recent conflicts in cities such as Mosul and Raqqa , in which entire city parts were destroyed and have been made uninhabitable .\nThe Irish-led , UN backed international declaration is a groundbreaking step towards curbing the use of such weapons .\nIt comes at the back of a decade of civil society

states must address as they begin the process of implementing the EWIPA declaration .\nStates must be frank about gaps in their current approach The first step in understanding how to implement the

where feasible and appropriate \u201d .\nDespite the UK representative in Dublin noting during the signing ceremony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and procedures in place to support the implementation \u201d , this has to date not been evident when it comes to public reporting on the effects of UK military actions .\nAs it stands , the UK maintains that it has evidence of only a single civilian casualty from its actions in the seven year anti-ISIS campaign , for example , despite extensive military involvement .\nThe US , by comparison , has admitted to over 1,400 civilian casualties as part of the Coalition .\nWhen challenged , UK officials tend to emphasise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a case of lower civilian casualties than in previous conflicts \u2013 but of poor evidence gathering .\nThis position was summarised by former Armed Forces Minister , Mark Lancaster , who emphasised in 2019 that ; \u201c [ I ] t is not our position that there has been only a single civilian casualty as a result of our military action .\nWhat we are saying is that we have evidence of only a single , or what we believe to have been a single , civilian casualty.\n\u201d In spite of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the UK are not able to accurately reflect the reality on the ground , there is , to our knowledge , no process in place to improve this approach and little willingness to engage with civil society to address this .\nIf this is not addressed , there will be a significant gap between the rhetoric of UK leadership when it comes to EWIPA and the reality on the ground .\nStates must build clarity on who is responsible for implementing the EWIPA declaration on a national level The second step states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to gain better internal understandings of who will be involved in its implementation .\nThis must include those focusing specifically on EWIPA , but also those focusing on topics such as human security , the protection of civilians , humanitarian response , development , diplomacy , and all the other elements required to protect those caught in conflict from being harmed by explosive weapons.The structures behind overseas military engagements are complex , quick changing , and lines of responsibility are often murky .\nYet it is only if all involved in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defence , and ministries of foreign affairs and overseas development , are dedicated to limiting the use of EWIPA , understanding their impact , and tracking civilian harm that occurs if they are used , that implementation will be effective .\nStates must be open to civil society inclusion in the implementation of the EWIPA declaration Civil society actors , many of us united under the INEW banner , played a significant role in the development of the EWIPA declaration and the advocacy that brought states to the process , a fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states at the conference in Dublin .\nWe stand ready to support the implementation in national contexts and across international coalitions .\nMany civil society organisations have spent years \u2013 sometimes decades \u2013 developing protection mechanisms and civilian harm tracking mechanisms , as well as conducting research into valuable lessons on the impact of EWIPA .\nCivil society organisations are also often direct links to the communities affected .\nIt is in all of our interests that these resources are effectively shared with those in power .\nIn those states where there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on civilian harm and civilian harm tracking , governments and their militaries must also commit to a certain level of transparency on the implementation of the EWIPA declaration .\nThey should work with civil society actors to understand the gaps in their current approach and set up milestones for implementation .\nThe endorsing ceremony was a promising step towards recognising the immense harm that these weapons have caused in recent years \u2013 and the harm they will continue to cause as their impact reverberates through communities .\nIf the declaration is implemented well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explosive weapons in their cities , towns , and camps .\nYet there are pitfalls each state must avoid if their implementation of the declaration is to be meaningful .\nThey must be frank about current gaps in their system and must be willing to address them .\nThey must gain an oversight of everyone who will play a role in the effective implementation of EWIPA .\nAnd they should work with civil society actors who have resources to share and stand ready to support implementation .\n\u2022 Implementation Brief : Political
