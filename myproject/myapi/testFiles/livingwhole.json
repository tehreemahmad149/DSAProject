enough sleep , everyone should aim to get a full night \u2019 s rest if they want to mitigate food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which can then trigger cravings .\nIt can also make people turn to \u201c comfort eating.\n\u201d When your mood falls , your brain \u2019 s craving for an uplifting reward can manifest itself as a craving for your favorite childhood snack .\nAlong with stress , the brain \u2019 s ability to make strong associations between behavior and environment is a major cause of cravings .\nA classic example of this is the association between popcorn and movies .\nMost people will crave and buy popcorn at the movies , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIf you have a habit of snacking in front of the T.V .\nor buying candy bars during your work break , your cravings are likely to increase when you
