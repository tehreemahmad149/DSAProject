COVID-19 origin theory is to explain a human outbreak in Wuhan , China , when the closest wild relatives of SARS-CoV-2 are located far away , 1700 km to the South West .\nIn public , virologists have tended to say that the proximity of the outbreak to the Wuhan Institute of Virology , which uniquely specialises in collecting , studying , and enhancing , SARS-related coronaviruses , is a coincidence .\nInstead , they point to the nearby Huanan seafood market as the probable spillover site , even though it is similar to thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origin has officially been dismissed by the authorities in China .\nNevertheless , on February 25th a preprint authored by George Gao , head of China \u2019 s CDC , and 38 other Chinese virologists appeared that seems intended to settle the issue ( Gao et al.\n, 2022 ) .\nThe Gao article concludes , based on several lines of evidence , including a lack of correlation between positive virus samples and stalls that sold animals , that the Huanan market was simply an amplifying event .\nThese authors do not specify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerge , except to note that virus samples reported from other countries predate their Huanan market sampling by several months .\nThis conclusion is in line with Chinese government statements that SARS-CoV-2 came from outside China .\nJust sixteen hours later , on February 26th , two preprints appeared simultaneously that directly contradict the Gao conclusions .\nThe senior authors of these companion articles are an overlapping set of very high-profile virologists .\nNone are from China .\nOne of these preprints asserts , based on surface swabs and other environmental samples found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the \u201c unambiguous epicenter \u201d of the pandemic ( Worobey et al.\n, 2022 ) .\nThe second argues that SARS-CoV-2 emerged at least twice at the market ( Pekar et al.\n, 2022 ) .\nAccording to these latter authors , one zoonotic spillover created what are known as the lineage A SARS-CoV-2 viruses and a second spillover was the root of all lineage B SARS-CoV-2 viruses .\nThese two spillovers , they say , decisively contradict a lab leak .\nMany SARS-CoV-2 genomes found early in the outbreak are intermediate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThese intermediates have previously been assumed to indicate a single spillover with one lineage evolving into the other ( Morel et al.\n, 2021 ; Pipes et al.\n, 2021 ) .\nPekar et al .\npropose instead that such intermediates are all either artifactual ( mostly sequencing errors ) or are otherwise irrelevant to the origin .\nBoth papers are coy , however , about what type of animal was involved in their theorised spillovers .\nThese conflicting conclusions set up an interesting dynamic .\nClearly , Chinese virologists do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , the senior authors of Pekar et al .\nand Worobey et al .\nare prominent Western virologists .\nMany , like Kristian Andersen , Robert Garry , Ed Holmes , and Andrew Rambaut , are vocal public supporters of a zoonotic origin , and very close to Anthony Fauci the director of NIAID .\nOne aspect of this dynamic is the East/West split .\nClearly , the two factions are not co-operating .\nThe other is a difference of approach .\nThe Chinese researchers assert what they think did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an explicit hypothesis ( except for the host animal ) , the Western virologists have staked their credibility on a specific theory .\nThe former approach is low risk ; the latter is high risk since any specific theory is potentially vulnerable if new evidence were to come forward that disproves it ( as proven earlier cases would ) ; but the reward has been ample media attention of the \u201c The Lab Leak is Dead \u201d type .\nA significant feature of this episode is the close timing of the three papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-cooperation , it seems obvious that the Worobey/Pekar preprints were an ambush .\nTheir appearance was precisely timed to spike the headlines that the China CDC paper would likely have generated by ruling out a market origin .\nDo Pekar and Worobey make their case ?\nEspecially if one includes the new Gao et al .\nevidence , there are already powerful reasons to doubt both the market-zoonotic origin and a dual-spillover .\nThese reasons are largely glossed over by the Pekar and Worobey preprints so they are worth outlining briefly : 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late in the Wuhan outbreak .\nThe first reason , and the simplest , is that the market samples were taken between Jan 1st and March 30th , 2020 .\nYet plentiful evidence , such as contemporaneous newspaper reports of an outbreak in Wuhan , implies that SARS-CoV-2 was circulating widely in Wuhan and beyond by January 1st .\nSuch evidence makes it difficult to agree that the market samples , so hotly discussed , have any special relevance to the source of the pandemic virus itself .\nFor example , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were 174 COVID-19 hospitalisations in Wuhan by December 31st 2019 .\nGiven the normal delay between infection and hospitalisation and the significant rate at which COVID-19 gives asymptomatic and mild cases , these hospitalisations likely represented only the tip of a large infectious outbreak in December .\nIndeed , Ian Lipkin , an epidemiologist at Columbia University , told an interviewer he knew of an outbreak in Wuhan by December 15th , 2019 .\nLipkin has subsequently confirmed this statement .\nAnd in spring 2020 , Peter Daszak , President of the EcoHealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who runs ProMED , and Public Health Professor Lawrence Gostin made similar statements to the LA Times .\nFurther back still , according to ABC News , US security agencies were tracking a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan in November .\nEarly wide spread of the virus in Wuhan is evidenced too by a detailed case study of a family from Guangdong who visited Wuhan between December 29th and January 4th , 2020 .\nFive from a total of six family members contracted COVID-19 while in Wuhan , without them having visited any markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFurther afield , a significant body of genome sequence and antibody evidence suggests SARS-CoV-2 was in Europe and other countries in the fall of 2019 , well before the Huanan market samples were taken ( reviewed in Canuti et al.\n, 2022 ) .\nIf there were thousands of cases in the city of Wuhan by Jan 1st when the market was closed and 10,000 people per day usually visited it , how do samples taken then ( or later ) constitute credible evidence for a market origin ?\nQuite likely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have COVID-19 infections were just typical for Wuhan in December 2019 ( Courtier-Orgogoz and de Assis , 2022 ) .\nTypical or not , the market samples were collected too late to distinguish a market origin from any other origin in or near Wuhan .\n2 ) Environmental samples collected at the market are of human origin and did not come from animals sold there .\nThe aim of the Chinese CDC paper was to analyse the environmental samples ( swabs from surfaces etc . )\nthat they took in and around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2020 ( Gao et al.\n, 2022 ) .\nThey concluded that the market was only an amplifying event , in part because SARS-CoV-2-positive samples were associated with stalls belonging to multiple types of vendors , including those not selling animals ( the Worobey preprint argues there is a correlation ) .\nMore compelling , the CDC authors found that the samples collected from the market , which Pekar and Worobey claim are from infected animals , are admixed only with human genetic material and not with genetic material from raccoon dogs or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe only reasonable inference is that these positive samples did not derive from the faeces or urine or exhalations of a live non-human animal .\nFew results would better indicate that virus-positive market samples derive from infected humans as opposed to other species .\n3 ) Pekar and Worobey rely on circular reasoning to identify root viruses .\nThe 2022 Pekar et al .\npreprint adapts the findings of a previous publication ( Pekar et al.\n, 2021 ) to generate the novel hypothesis of a split phylogeny that traces SARS-CoV-2 back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Huanan market .\nThese two spillovers , they claim , are represented today by what are known as lineage A and lineage B viruses , which differ by only two mutations .\nHowever , the phylogenetic methods used for building evolutionary trees and thus identifying the root virus in both Pekar papers are highly problematic because they are vulnerable to uneven and biased sampling and unusual genetic phenomena , such as superspreading events ( Liu et al.\n, 2020 ) .\nOne key bias relevant here is that , for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huanan market was a diagnostic requirement ( Liu et al.\n, 2020 ) .\nThis will tend to orient phylogenies towards the market .\nFurther , Pekar et al .\nuse a clock-based algorithm that uses sampling dates to infer the root virus .\nThis method is designed to channel the choice of root virus towards those genomes sampled earliest .\nIf the market was the early focus of sampling , which it was , then the Pekar method of inferring the root is based on two independent forms of circular reasoning .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pekar and Worobey authors , who themselves decided , based on scant evidence , which patient cases counted towards the dataset and sometimes what were their disease onset dates .\nThe effect of this intervention was to add yet more circularity into the selection process for root viruses .\nTo satisfactorily determine which viruses are closest to the true origin requires instead a different method , one that is explicitly independent of ascertainment biases and subjective decision-making ( Liu et al.\n, 2020 ) .\n4 ) Pekar et al.\n, lack the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key assertion of the Pekar preprint is its proposal that extant lineage A and lineage B viruses represent the descendants of two independent SARS-CoV-2 spillover events ( Pekar et al.\n, 2022 ) .\nTo succeed , this double spillover claim must explain why numerous genome sequences exist that are intermediate between lineage A and lineage B .\nTo overcome this challenge , Pekar et al .\npropose that such intermediates are all either artifacts from sequencing errors or irrelevant to the origin question for other reasons .\nSequencing errors are common enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrate them convincingly in a minority of instances .\nFor example , for most of their suggested sequence artifacts they rely on an unverifiable \u2018 personal communication \u2019 from a single scientist ( L. Chen ) in China .\nTo make a case for the irrelevance of others they have to suggest , for example , that two genomes sampled in February in Beijing are irrelevant\u2013as if early sequences can not have spread elsewhere or persisted .\nUltimately , their bold suggestion that the phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2 is best explained by resolving it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported by evidence .\nPekar and Worobey fail to make their case and hence it is tempting to dismiss their heavy reliance on weak data , their non-parsimonious interpretations , their cherry-picking , and their circular reasoning as simple shoddy science .\nBut , in our experience , this would be an error .\nPoor science by otherwise competent scientists , and on such a scale , usually happens for a reason .\nAnd , in the light of the meeting , described by Katherine Eban of Vanity Fair , between Jesse Bloom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis Collins , and others , which revolved around deleted sequences from early patient samples , it seems more clear than ever what that reason is .\nOrdinary bad science mostly occurs for reasons that are simple and mundane .\nPerhaps a research field is considered a scientific backwater to which second-rate researchers have gravitated , or a research thesis was badly supervised or not completed .\nIf so , the results are almost sure to appear in a low-ranking peer-reviewed journal .\nThe other class of bad science fits a very different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders who control science \u2019 s purse-strings commit to a theory or a major programme that is then contradicted by emerging evidence .\nIf , for political or financial reasons , a policy course correction is unavailable , a rationalisation in a prominent scientific journal will be necessary to provide , as the Vatican might put it , \u201c guidance for the faithful \u201d .\nSuch publications typically have an unnecessarily large number of authors , who will mostly be laboratory heads and other prominent scientific leaders ; the article will usually appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visibility , like Nature , Cell , or Science , and the mistakes such papers contain ( the rationalisations ) are never errors\u2013they are purposeful and carefully calculated .\nA classic of this genre , which we dissected in detail , was the NIH response to the failure of the human genome project to deliver on its promise of explaining human noncommunicable disease , a problem that remains to this day ( Manolio et al.\n, 2009 ) .\nObviously , lab leak theories are a top concern of the infectious disease community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypothesis is the rather obvious intent of Fauci \u2019 s NIAID .\nGranted , we don \u2019 t yet know in which journals Pekar et al.\n, 2022 and Worobey et al.\n, 2022 will appear , but their precursors ( Pekar et al.\n, 2021 and Worobey , 2021 ) were both published in Science .\nBefore that , the prototype for all future efforts was The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2 , published in Nature Medicine ( Andersen et al.\n, 2020 ) .\nPutting this all together , one can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuing the same general strategy , the first step of which is to ignore , discredit , deny , delete , destroy , or otherwise conceal , early sequences and samples ( Bloom , 2021 ; Canuti et al.\n, 2022 ) .\nErasing , or failing to collect , early information has the primary effect of lessening the likelihood that a true origin will ever be retrieved .\nSecondarily , erasure also makes it easier to force preferred conclusions on the data that remain .\nOn the Chinese side , removing or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wuhan outbreak helps to place the first documented appearance of the virus outside of China entirely .\nThe Western goal has instead been to force a market spillover conclusion by preferentially discrediting samples and cases that occurred prior to the market sampling and those with no links to the market ( Pekar et al.\n, 2021 and Worobey , 2021 ) .\nThese strategic aims would be unfeasible without the circularity of the standard phylogenetic methods discussed above , which are quite widely understood by insiders ( Liu et al.\n, 2020 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus , picking and choosing early samples lets clock-based phylogenetic methods that are vulnerable to sampling biases deliver a foreordained root virus .\nThe major complication , visible to all after the publication of the conflicting Gao , Pekar , and Worobey preprints , is that a significant conflict has arisen due to the divergent origin scenarios each group is trying to fit the facts to .\nIt is a reasonable inference from the above that the leading virologists on each side , and who are directing these efforts , strongly suspect ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evidence ) that early data would not exonerate virus research in Wuhan , otherwise the same people would be hunting for early samples with great alacrity , which is clearly not happening .\nAnd we can surmise it is a lab leak that is being covered up since it is the only concern that both Chinese and Western virologists could plausibly share .\nUntil recently , the COVID-19 origin question was therefore set to devolve into a simple two-way tug-of-war between the Gao club in the East and the Fauci club in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected , however , was that a novel phylogenetic method would emerge capable of discrediting their careful calculus .\nRecently , a different method has been applied to the SARS-CoV-2 origin question ( ) .\nThis method is new to virology but it is widely used in cancer research ( e.g .\nMiura et al.\n, 2018 ) .\nUsing it , Kumar , Pond , and colleagues were able to infer the existence of viral strains that are older ( i.e .\nancestors of ) Wuhan-hu-1 ( the standard SARS-CoV-2 reference genome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least 3 mutations , which is a lot .\nTheir innovative method is called Mutational Order Analysis ( MOA ) .\nMOA is an important advance over standard approaches , not least because it doesn \u2019 t rely on clocks ( i.e .\ntime ) to orient ( i.e .\nbias ) the evolutionary trees it produces .\nRather , it uses genome sequence data alone to deduce the progenitor virus .\nThus , MOA can be used to undo known biases , such as clocks , other sampling confounders , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the major difference between MOA and the phylogenetic method used by Pekar et al.\n, consider a theoretical individual in Wuhan in late 2019 who caught a very early case of SARS-CoV-2 and who then flew to a distant country .\nOnce there , they seeded a minor outbreak that lasted just a few weeks or months ( not unlike the Guangdong family noted earlier ) .\nIf any genome from a later case in this outbreak were by chance sequenced , this information would be very valuable .\nIt would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or very close to it ) .\nFrom this hypothetical example we can see that even sequences that occur late in an epidemic , or far from a presumed geographic origin , can , in principle , preserve critical information about that origin .\nOrdinarily , phylogenetic analysis of the origin ( including Pekar et al.\n, 2021 and 2022 and Bloom , 2021 ) tends to focus , sometimes entirely , on early sequences and those found local to the outbreak origin .\nGenomes considered of improbable relevance to the origin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pekar et al .\n2022 performed their analysis on 787 genomes , with a cut-off date of February 14th , 2020 .\nMOA , however , can use every available genome sequence to build up a picture of viral relatedness , without discriminating .\nIf any virus genome in the data set constitutes an apparent missing link between two viruses it will be inserted as part of the mutational order that is built up .\nBecause MOA uses a very large data set , specifically to capture idiosyncratic events such as the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far more accurate , far more detailed , and much more statistically robust evolutionary tree than conventional approaches .\nBest of all , it does so without introducing any biases of its own .\nFor these reasons , MOA is clearly a superior method .\nIts value is especially great for inferring outbreak origins in cases where , like SARS-CoV-2 , early sequences are scarce and their collection is subject to sampling biases .\n1 ) MOA identifies just one root virus .\nFrom almost 176,000 full-length genomes , MOA was able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viruses , with very high statistical confidence ( Kumar et al.\n, 2021 ) .\nTheir results are summarised in Fig .\n1 below ( taken from Fig .\n2 of Kumar et al.\n, 2021 ) .\nOverall , three of its findings strongly contradict the dual spillover market theory : 1 ) As is apparent from Fig .\n1 , unlike Pekar et al .\n( 2022 ) , MOA identifies a single root virus ( \u03bc , top left , is its first mutant ) .\nA single root virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial spillover .\nA single spillover event is a crucial observation because it strongly implies a lab leak ( since scientists tend to work with pure cultures ) ; whereas equivalent evidence for multiple and/or genetically diverse spillovers would have implied a natural source .\nMOA also shows that all lineage B viruses are descended from one lineage A virus .\n2 ) The root virus identified by MOA predates all the root viruses identified by Pekar and Worobey .\nThe virus identified by MOA as the root is separated by multiple mutations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Huanan market and from Wuhan-hu-1 .\nThis infers that all known market samples are well downstream of patient zero .\nTherefore too , as was also concluded by Gao et al.\n, the market samples represent an amplifying event , at most .\nEvolution takes time to occur .\nBecause multiple mutations accumulated before the first confirmed cases , Kumar et al .\ncalculated that the initial spillover ( presumably in Wuhan ) was around late October/early November , i.e .\nseveral months before the Wuhan market was first sampled ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This conclusion is hence consistent with the presence of far-flung SARS-CoV-2 genomes in Europe and elsewhere in the fall of 2019 .\nIt is also consistent with wide spread of the virus in Wuhan before the market samples were collected .\nVery recently , Kumar and colleagues released a further preprint ( Caraballo-Ortiz et al.\n, 2022 ) .\nIt uses even more data ( 1 million genomes ) and an improved method , which they call TopHap , to make their findings still more robust .\nThe addition of many more genome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the root , affirms the original conclusions of a single root virus and that lineage B evolved from lineage A .\nIt also allowed them to move back the root virus by one further mutation and this pushes back even further in time the predicted date of SARS-CoV-2 emergence\u2013into September , 2019 .\nThis September spillover date further contradicts Pekar and Worobey \u2019 s date .\nHowever , it agrees well with a broad set of other phylogenetic analyses and makes the farflung virus findings in Europe and elsewhere more plausible still ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Barzilai , 2021 ; Song et al.\n, 2021 ; Xia , 2021 ) .\n3 ) Analysing only viruses found in China determined the results of the Pekar articles .\nIn their phylogenetic analyses , both Pekar papers are noteworthy for selecting narrow geographical and temporal cut-offs for their data sets .\nThough these choices seem , at first sight , reasonable enough , as Kumar et al .\npoint out for Pekar et al.\n, 2021 , the choices determine their ultimate conclusions .\nThe excluding of sequences obtained outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 4 months after December ) prevented these authors from including the major early branch that began with v ( see Fig .\n1 ) .\nThe v lineage was first sampled in the US but is needed for the correct selection of a root virus ( see also Morel et al.\n, 2021 ) .\nUltimately , the complete exclusion of the v lineage due to use of narrow cut-offs is a key reason why the two approaches reached divergent conclusions ( Kumar et al.\n, 2021 ) .\nIn short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n( 2021 and 2022 ) is to deploy narrow windows for data acquisition to accomplish the phylogenetic equivalent of p-hacking .\nIf Pekar and Worobey are wrong , are Gao et al .\nright ?\nThe MOA method is only somewhat kinder to the Gao et al .\norigin conclusions .\nAlthough MOA supports the market being a secondary site , it contradicts the idea of a virus origin outside China .\nGao at al .\npoint at evidence for very early cases outside of China and imply that one of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is clear from the Kumar et al .\nanalysis that Wuhan and China are where the genetic diversity around the root occurs .\nIn other words , the virus is unlikely to have emerged in Italy ( or elsewhere ) in late 2019 and seeded Wuhan .\nFar more probably , it spilled over in Wuhan and seeded Italy .\nThe status of a zoonotic origin in the light of MOA We described above seven major flaws in the hypothesis of a double market spillover .\nMost of these criticisms apply to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market , but it is notable that the MOA findings of Kumar , Pond , and colleagues advance the critique very significantly .\nTheir two papers thus represent important landmarks in the study of the origin of COVID-19 ( Kumar et al.\n, 2021 ; Caraballo-Ortiz et al.\n, 2022 ) .\nThe key points are worth recalling : The extensive evidence of an epidemic in Wuhan long before the Huanan market samples were taken ; that the market samples containing SARS-CoV-2 were mixed with human RNA and not with animal RNA ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s phylogenetic method ; the lack of support for dismissing viruses intermediate between lineages A and B ; the methodological superiority of the MOA method , which identifies a single and significantly earlier root ; and , last , the dependence of the Pekar evolutionary tree on ignoring SARS-CoV-2 sequences harvested either late or outside of China .\nThere is also the wider context to consider .\nIn case it needs reiterating , there is still no evidence for wild or farmed animals being infected with SARS-CoV-2 in China , either before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke out .\nMoreover , zoonotic theorists have been very reluctant to specify a clear candidate animal species as an intermediate host .\nThis seems to be because it is hard to construct a good case for any of them .\nThird , there is the unremarkable nature , by Chinese standards , of the Huanan market .\nWhy Wuhan ?\nIt is a question still unanswered by natural zoonotic theories .\nIn short , it is unreasonable to claim that the Huanan market was the \u201c unambiguous epicentre \u201d of the pandemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSuch certitude is scientifically unwarranted and only serves to give the appearance of a false flag operation .\nThis impression is strengthened since neither Gao , Pekar , nor Worobey , ever discuss the existence of the Wuhan Institute of Virology ( WIV ) and the obvious alternative hypothesis that they know goes along with it .\nThe WIV is just a few miles from the market and , according to its US funders and the people who work there , it specialises in the collection and study and enhancement of SARS-related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nFor decades , a major goal of its research has been to identify or create ones primed for human spillover ( e.g .\nLi et al.\n, 2019 ) .\nThe two MOA/TopHap papers provide by far the strongest candidate yet for a root virus and they detail its subsequent evolution ( Caraballo-Ortiz et al.\n, 2022 ; Kumar et al.\n, 2021 ) .\nConsequently , they have even more to tell us because precise rooting is invaluable for understanding additional key aspects of any virus origin .\nOne key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is whether the root virus could infect putative intermediate hosts , such as the raccoon dog suggested by Pekar and Worobey .\nAnswering this requires knowing precisely what those early strains were .\nSuch tests can be highly misleading if performed on virus strains from much later in the pandemic since the variants of SARS-CoV-2 have distinct mammalian host ranges ( Montaguteli et al.\n, 2021 ; Gu et al.\n, 2020 ) .\nIn particular , it ought to trouble origin theorists that the only evidence for SARS-CoV-2 infecting raccoon dogs comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Freuling et al.\n, 2021 ) .\nA second benefit of accurate rooting is probably the most significant of all .\nIt follows from the fact that root viruses can show what , if any , were the initial adaptation steps of SARS-CoV-2 to humans .\nFor example , the MOA phylogeny indicates ( though this can \u2019 t be seen in Fig .\n1 ) that even the very early virus strains that predated the market samples , persisted unchanged long into the pandemic .\nThis is a very important observation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvements in its fitness , SARS-CoV-2 was very well adapted to humans by September or October and , so far as we can tell , from the very start .\nCorroborating this , the very earliest strains differ only by synonymous mutations ( see e.g .\nmutants \u03bc in Fig .\n1 ) .\nSynonymous ( ) mutations are nucleotide changes only ; that is , they do not alter the amino acid sequence and so they usually have zero effect on the fitness of the virus .\nFrom the synonymous nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these earliest viruses : \u201c already possessed the repertoire of protein sequences needed to infect , spread , and persist in the global human population \u201d ( Kumar et al.\n, 2021 ) .\nMoreover , many immediate descendants of these viruses often also contained only synonymous mutations and yet these strains too often became abundant .\nIndeed , such barely altered genomes were found \u201c on every sampled continent \u201d ( Kumar et al.\n, 2021 ) .\nAgain , this implies the same conclusion .\nWhichever way one looks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the very earliest viruses were not only highly adapted to humans but able , unaltered , to cause a pandemic .\nThis is a tremendously informative result .\nThe question of whether SARS-CoV-2 was highly adapted to humans ( and thus presumably preadapted ) has been in hot dispute almost from the beginning of the pandemic ( Zhan et al.\n, 2020 ) .\nBut the MOA phylogeny provides by far the most decisive evidence yet that indeed it was .\nReading into their phylogeny a little further gives even more support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eighth mutation did one arise ( \u03b2 in Fig .\n1 ) that has subsequently been shown to increase the fitness of the virus in humans ( Dearlove et al.\n, 2020 ; van Dorp et al.\n, 2020 ) .\n\u03b2 is the well-known D614G mutation , first identified in Wuhan late January .\nBy this time the pandemic was well underway .\nThe only other mutation in Fig.1 that became abundant during the pandemic was its immediate predecessor , \u03b2 .\n\u03b2 is a synonymous mutation ( again ) that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al.\n, 2020 ) .\nThe significance of this pattern is to indicate that , even though they gave amino acid changes , even the nonsynonumous mutations clustered at the root were selectively neutral .\nThat is , they too arose at random and not because they conferred any advantage on the virus .\nThis again strongly reinforces the idea that the virus was under little pressure to adapt during its early spread in Wuhan .\nIt is not at all normal for a virus to enter a new host population without also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus the first SARS coronavirus ( SARS-CoV ) acquired amino acid changes during its early spread in humans ( Zhan et al.\n, 2020 ) .\nThe alternative norm is for the virus to fail to adapt to its new host at all , such as has happened so far with every one of the many introductions into humans of the coronavirus MERS ( Dudas et al.\n, 2018 ) .\nConceding that SARS-CoV-2 was preadapted , some have argued that SARS-CoV-2 is a \u2018 generalist \u2019 virus ( Frutos et al.\n, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very little evidence for this .\nSARS-CoV-2 does not infect most mammal species ( Kock and Caceres-Escobar , 2022 ) .\nIt can be actively transmitted by far fewer species still , and , when those few do transmit the virus , adaptive mutations occur ( Gu et al.\n, 2021 ; Sawatzki et al.\n, 2021 ; Tan et al.\n, 2022 ) .\nIn short , SARS-CoV-2 has not proven preadapted to any mammalian host species tested so far ( except humans ) and so it bears none of the hallmarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SARS-CoV-2 implies a lab leak .\nBut it also implies a leak of a specific kind of virus ; one that is not merely adapted to human cells but to transmission between whole , intact , humans .\nOnly one theory of how SARS-CoV-2 arose fits this description .\nIt is the Mojiang Miners Passage theory .\nWhere now for origin research ?\nMajor institutions , primarily the EcoHealth Alliance , the NIH , and the WIV , hold large troves of information that could prove or disprove a lab leak .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in practice , each has denied numerous requests for documents and other data .\nIf one only listened to their words , one would think they wanted to find the origins of COVID-19 , but their actions speak louder .\nProgress will therefore likely depend on independent initiatives .\nWhen Jesse Bloom ingeniously retrieved previously deleted early SARS-CoV-2 sequences from the cloud and thereby recovered a novel early virus strain ( Bloom , 2021 ) , virologist Rasmus Nielsen said that this information was : \u201c the most important data that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more than a year \u201d .\nNielsen was proven correct since Bloom \u2019 s discovery has been crucial to the improved rooting of Kumar and colleagues ( Caraballo-Ortiz , et al.\n, 2022 ) .\nThe exceptional research value of these early sequences indicates also the appropriate scientific benchmark for judging those who erase or withold such evidence .\nHistory is full of ironies , but not many exceed the spectacle of prominent scientists , whose careers are publicly funded on the promise of identifying causes of infectious diseases , not wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 pandemic .\nWhy , after all , did public institutions like NIH , NIAID , USAID , DOD , who have showered money on the EcoHealth Alliance , supposedly to prevent pandemics , not fund widespread searches for early SARS-CoV-2 infections at the very start of the pandemic ?\nGiven this blockade , even at this late date , probably the simplest and most useful way to advance the scientific search for the origin of SARS-CoV-2 would be to locate and analyse more samples from early in the outbreak , from any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2021 ; Montomoli et al ; 2021 ; Canuti et al.\n, 2022 ) .\nPreliminary research suggests a plethora of suitable clinical and environmental samples exist in civilian and also military sample collections and databases , and that searches for early sequences are likely to be fruitful ( Canuti et al .\n2022 , Paixao et al .\n2022 , Althoff et al .\n2021 , Chapleau et al .\n2021 , Lednicky et al .\n2021 , Basavaraju et al .\n2021 , Chen et al .\n2020 ) .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ one .\nDr Tedros of the WHO has called investigating the origin of the pandemic \u201c a moral obligation \u201c .\nWe would go further .\nAlthough there is no law against obstructing origin research , it should nevertheless be considered a crime against all humanity to make it more likely that an event that resulted in millions of deaths and untold misery will recur because we never found its cause ( Relman , 2020 ) .\nAndersen , K.

Holmes et al.\n, 2021 ; Worobey et al.\n, 2022 ; Pekar et al.\n, 2022 ; Holmes , 2022 ) .\nThis article dissects some of these efforts to create an intellectually poisoned environment around the origin of the virus .\nSpecifically , it is about how , amid the complications and confusions of emerging scientific information and journalistic revelations , this group of Fauci insiders has cynically and strategically attempted to dismiss a specific theory of COVID-19 \u2019 s origin , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention , as I will show by critiquing the views they express , embodies a paradox .\nIt has arisen not because they see the theory as flawed but precisely because it is a highly viable and parsimonious explanation of SARS-CoV-2 \u2019 s emergence .\nScientific Reputation management : the strategy Amid the challenge of clear official disapproval of any lab leak discussion , only rarely has any virologist been willing to discuss publicly the detailed scientific merits of the different lab leak theories .\nInstead , although university scientists are nowadays paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with expertise relevant to the COVID-19 origin question have become notorious on the social media platform Twitter for the blocking of anyone , including scientists , engaging them in lab leak discussions .\nIn response , mocking Twitter accounts like BlockedByAVirologist have documented this suppression of scientific discussion .\nOur own account ( @ BioSRP ) , for example , has been blocked by prominent virologists Peter Daszak , Eddie Holmes , Kristian Andersen and Angela Rasmussen .\nSince our \u2018 offence \u2019 each time was merely to draw polite attention to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems that this blockade is coordinated and tactically directed at anyone publicly discussing scientific alternatives to a natural zoonotic origin .\nThis should be strategically unsurprising .\nIt is orthodox public relations that the advocates for a clear frontrunner ( i.e .\na natural zoonosis ) should not publicly recognise a lesser-known rival , in this case a lab leak .\nThe logic is that recognition only validates that rival and offers them free publicity .\nWith a few notable exceptions , the virological community has adopted this principle even in their scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they first convened , five members of the Fauci group submitted for publication an article titled \u201c The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2 \u201d ( Andersen et al.\n, 2020 ) .\nThis article was rapidly published .\nIt categorically dismissed a Wuhan lab leak as a credible possibility .\nEven though it is not even a full scientific paper ( it is a \u201c correspondence \u201d piece ) and its major conclusions were premature and some erroneous , this assessment nevertheless has 4453 citations ( and still rising ) .\nBy contrast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorporating a lab leak all have very few citations .\nFor example , the highly credible review paper \u201c Might SARS-CoV-2 Have Arisen via Serial Passage through an Animal Host or Cell Culture ?\n\u201d has just 21 citations ( Sirotkin and Sirotkin , 2020 ) .\nA more recent example of this scientific shunning is the paper : \u201c The origins of SARS-CoV-2 : A critical review \u201d , published in September 2021 ( Holmes et al.\n, 2021 ) .\nDespite claiming to present a \u201c critical review \u201d , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fauci group , do not authentically describe any lab leak hypothesis ; nor do they cite even a single scientific paper or theory hypothesizing one ( e.g .\nSegreto and Deigin 2020 ; Sirotkin and Sirotkin , 2020 ; Rahalkar and Bahulikar , 2020 ; Speciale , 2020 ; Kaina , 2021 ) .\nIts readers are apparently expected to guess what a lab leak might have entailed .\nFailing to cite competing theories or prior work is a basic transgression of scholarly ethics .\nOn one level , citation failures are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : \u2018 Oh what a tangled web we weave/When first we practice to deceive \u2018 was not wrong .\nCitation failure at scale implicates a broad web of peer reviewers , editors and journals .\nIt is a key signal that virologists , as a profession , would rather defend risky virus research and the millions of dollars in biodefense and biosecurity money that it brings them , than stand up for science \u2019 s professed values of rigor , openness , and accountability .\nFor these reasons , a departure from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fauci group ought to be treated as a significant event .\nIn mid-October 2021 , on the social media platform Twitter , virologist Andrew Rambaut , a Professor of Evolutionary Ecology at Edinburgh University in Scotland made an unusual intervention .\nHe explicitly critiqued a lab leak theory of the origin of SARS-CoV-2 called the Mojiang Miners Passage theory ( the MMP theory ) .\nThe MMP theory , which was conceived by biologist Allison Wilson and myself , is the proposition that the SARS-CoV-2 virus derives from one of six Chinese miners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe six miners , who had been shoveling bat guano , developed symptoms that closely resembled those of COVID-19 ( Rahalkar and Bahulikar , 2020 ) .\nThree of the six miners died and two suffered from chronic infections lasting over five months .\nOfficially , the outbreak remains unexplained .\nHowever , medical samples obtained from these miners were sent to the Wuhan Institute of Virology ( WIV ) where they were tested by the coronavirus research group of Dr Zheng-li Shi .\nAccording to three sources , these tests indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coronavirus .\nSubsequent sampling in the same mine uncovered numerous bat coronaviruses , including RaTG13 , which is very closely related to SARS-CoV-2 ( Ge et al.\n, 2016 ; Zhou P. et al.\n, 2020 ) .\nBased on these observations , we have proposed that researchers at the WIV isolated a coronavirus from samples taken from at least one of the sick miners and that this coronavirus was studied and perhaps genetically manipulated there .\nWe further proposed that , due to its long incubation inside a hospitalised miner , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt was this human-adapted virus , we proposed , that spilled over in Wuhan .\nFor Rambaut to critique the MMP theory directly is thus significant on several levels .\nFirst , virologists \u2019 stance of publicly ignoring specifics about lab leaks means that we have only an imperfect and superficial idea , embellished by occasional but out-of-date emails revealed through FOIA , ( and more recently via congressional demands ) what leading ( and indeed most ) virologists truly think about the origin of SARS-CoV-2 and why .\nThis lack especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( MMP theory ) .\nUnlike lab leak theories that explain SARS-CoV-2 as largely or entirely the product of genetic engineering or other lab techniques , the MMP theory is largely biological in nature .\nIts \u2019 evaluation relies heavily on estimating the plausibility of natural processes such as the infection , recombination , and evolution of viruses inside the body of a hospitalised miner .\nIn contrast , determining the likelihood of lab engineering makes much greater use of written evidence from grants , emails , talks , and publications .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is considerably more difficult for non-experts to independently evaluate the plausibility of the MMP theory than it is for them to do the same for other lab leak scenarios .\nHence , assessing expert views is particularly critical .\nFor this reason , we welcomed the chance to debate ( if only on Twitter ) the merits of the MMP with a well-informed critic\u00ad\u2013and Andrew Rambaut is an especially prominent and well-connected one .\nJust since the pandemic began , he has accumulated over 40,000 citations ( according to Google Scholar ) for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world \u2019 s most cited scientists .\nRambaut is additionally a founder of a virus research consortium called the ARTIC Network and he runs the popular website virological .\nHe is also a founding member of the UK government \u2019 s SAGE advisory group on the pandemic .\nMore particularly , Rambaut is a leading proponent of a natural origin for SARS-CoV-2 .\nHe established this status very early in the pandemic as a co-author of the hugely influential \u201c The proximal origin of SARS-CoV \u201c , referred to above .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerns about a lab leak ( but see also his co-authorship of Holmes et al.\n, 2021 and Pekar et al.\n, 2022 ) .\nAnd perhaps most significant of all , Rambaut was one of the small group summoned by Dr Fauci .\nThus , Rambaut is one of the most significant scientists of the pandemic .\nArguably , he is preeminent among its evolutionary virologists .\nFor multiple reasons therefore , his views on COVID-19 \u2019 s origin and the MMP theory are of exceptional interest .\nHere is the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October 18th 2021 : This Oct 18th tweet is direct and emphatic .\nIt conveys the impression that its author has a knock-down argument .\nAs also can be seen from the screenshot , it repeats and amplifies an earlier tweet of his from Oct 11th .\nThat Oct 11th tweet cited the @ BioSRP account , which I administer .\nThe first point to notice about these tweets is the apparent trigger , which may explain why Rambaut broke ranks to attack our theory .\nIn his two tweets Rambaut alluded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen in \u201c chronic infections \u201d .\nThis refers to a fascinating but also alarming recent scientific discovery\u2013about which I had just spoken to a workshop on the origins of SARS-CoV-2 hosted by the British Medical journal .\nThis discovery , which may well hold the key to the future of the pandemic , has been much discussed by experts but mostly out of public sight .\nThe basic observation is that , with the exception of Delta , almost every novel variant worthy of being named by the WHO , including Alpha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( from South Africa ) , Gamma ( from Brazil ) , Mu ( from Colombia ) , and mostly recently Omicron , has emerged according to a pattern that is consistent but entirely unexpected ( see e.g .\nFaria et al.\n, 2021 ) .\nViral variants are so called because they contain large numbers of mutations , many of which are unique to each of them .\nThis makes them radical outliers from the wider population of viruses .\nSecond , they are extremely successful , i.e .\nthey are remarkably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and most surprising , their nearest known relatives are not , as one might suppose , other contemporaneous SARS-CoV-2 strains , but instead viruses that became extinct many months ( or even years ) before .\nThe Alpha variant , for example , emerged in September , 2020 , from a virus previously seen in about April , 2020 ; Omicron emerged in November 2021 from a virus last seen in about May 2020 ( Hill et al.\n, 2022 ) .\nThus , each variant is hyper-adapted but simultaneously a genetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Martin et al.\n, 2022 ) .\nThis can be seen in Figure 2 .\nIt is adapted from Laiton-Donato et al .\nwho characterised in detail the variant known as Mu ( B.1.621 ) .\nTheir figure also includes variants Alpha ( B.1.1.7 ) , Beta ( B.1.427 ) , and Gamma ( P.1. )\n.\nThe unusual evolution of all these variants is signalled by the exceptionally long unbranched line leading to each variant and emanating from the centre of the chart ( which is the virus origin ) .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents a sampling event , long lines between spots show rapid evolution and lack of branching indicates genetic isolation .\nSince Alpha , Beta , Omicron and other novel variants have successively outcompeted each other as well as other virus strains , they have , in effect , dictated the course of the pandemic .\nGiven this pattern , others can be expected to emerge in the near future .\nThus , a quiet but high stakes debate is happening , asking what is the origin of these genetic freaks ?\nOne proposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ populations that are epidemiologically isolated ( or at least hidden from sequencing projects ) .\nOthers have suggested that the virus spread into another species ( such as a mouse ) where they evolved over a long period before jumping back into humans ( Martin et al.\n, 2022 ; Hill et al.\n, 2022 ) .\nBut the explanation favoured by most virologists , including Rambaut , is that these variants have emerged from chronically infected individuals who were either hospitalised or immunocompromised ( Hill et al.\n, 2022 ) .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infections early in the pandemic and , in their vulnerable state , failed to eradicate the virus .\nLong incubation inside a single infected patient allowed evolution to occur at an unusually rapid pace , leading ultimately to the creation of radically different versions of SARS-CoV-2 .\nEventually , these patients transmitted their novel virus , thereby seeding the global spread of a new variant .\nThis idea is strongly supported by multiple publications describing patients with chronic SARS-CoV-2 infections who accumulate large numbers of adaptive mutations ( Avanzato et al.\n, 2020 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Choi et al.\n, 2020 ; Corey et al.\n, 2021 ; Truong et al.\n, 2021 ) .\nThis chronic infection theory accounts for how novel variants can be so different from currently circulating strains and simultaneously so successful , especially at evading immunity , and yet go undetected for months or years despite mass sampling and genome sequencing .\nFor us , the accumulating evidence for accelerated evolution in chronically infected patients has extra significance .\nWhen we first proposed , as part of the MMP theory , that chronic coronavirus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolutionary leap in which a bat virus ( or viruses ) evolved into a human one , some virologists claimed that such rapid evolution , perhaps spanning many hundreds of nucleotides , was implausible inside a single individual .\nThe appearance of Alpha , Omicron , and other variants means that the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in a single chronically infected miner can no longer be dismissed for want of evolutionary plausibility .\nIf our MMP theory is correct , the same biological phenomenon that creates most variants , also created the virus itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a leading author of papers identifying and analysing these new variants , about the MMP theory ( e.g .\nHill et al.\n, 2022 ) .\nAt first sight , dissecting arguments made on social media , even those from a renowned scientist , might seem of doubtful value .\nHowever , examining Rambaut \u2019 s thinking , which he went on to elaborate as we debated , proved highly worthwhile .\nFirst , his tweets are sufficient to expose profound weaknesses in his arguments .\nRambaut repeatedly misrepresented our views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positions we don \u2019 t hold .\nRambaut also critiqued us on points that are ultimately of little consequence .\nEven if we were wrong , it therefore would be of negligible consequence .\nFinally , Rambaut \u2019 s expression \u201c because phylogenetics \u201d ( see the tweet above ) is baby talk .\nIt is an unsubtle signal , reiterated in some of his subsequent tweets , to dismiss us as scientific naifs .\nIt \u2019 s a form of the classic ad hominem attack .\nWhen you don \u2019 t like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor are these errors his alone .\nSimilar ones have been made by others .\nIndeed , many apparently intentional , misconceptions have been spread in the media about the mine and the miners .\nWhat is special to Rambaut \u2019 s errors , however , is this : Rambaut is clearly a highly competent and experienced scientist .\nAny competent person in possession of a powerful argument does not bother to debunk straw men , critique details , or resort to ad hominem attacks .\nHis deployment of such dubious tactics strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the MMP theory .\nCould it be that the scientific community of which he is a leader has kept from him its best arguments against the MMP theory ?\nThis is not likely .\nMore probable , given that no coherent refutation of the MMP theory has yet been presented by anyone , is that none of the lab leak critics possesses decisive arguments against it ( Frutos et al.\n, 2021 ) .\nIf true , this is a very powerful observation .\nThe second point to notice about the tweets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into making them , resulting in an extended thread of tweets , including figures .\nThe third is that these two initial tweets both mis-describe the MMP theory .\nBased on this mis-characterisation Rambaut then \u2018 debunks \u2019 our thinking : how ridiculous , he suggests , for us to claim that SARS-CoV-2 could have arisen directly from RaTG13 , the SARS-CoV-2-like bat virus found in the mine .\nWe were away from the internet when Rambaut first tweeted these and so had no opportunity to reply .\nMeanwhile , this \u2018 debunking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many from professional virologists .\nHowever , after the second tweet , we did respond .\nClarifying the role RaTG13 did play in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 First identified in 2013 , RaTG13 is a SARS-related bat coronavirus found in the Mojiang mine .\nAt the outset of the pandemic , although it differs from SARS-CoV-2 by about 1140 nucleotides , it was the most closely related wild coronavirus to SARS-CoV-2 known ( Ge et al.\n, 2016 ; Zhou P. et al.\n, 2020 ) .\nThis greater similarity compared to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole length of its genome , which is almost 30,000 nucleotides long .\nHowever , since the pandemic began , intensive searching for other wild coronaviruses has unearthed 19 other viruses ( most are from bats but a few are from smuggled pangolins ) that are also closely related to SARS-CoV-2 ( Zhou P. et al.\n, 2020 ; Lam et al.\n, 2020 ; Chan and Zhan 2020 ; Temmam et al.\n, 2022 ; Murakami et al.\n, 2021 ; Delaune et al.\n, 2021 ; Wacharapluesadee et al.\n, 2021 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Li L. et al.\n, 2021 ) .\nTogether with SARS-CoV-2 , these viruses form a distinct evolutionary clade , sometimes called the nCoV clade ( Lytras et al.\n, 2021 ) .\nOnly one of these viruses , BANAL-52 , is closer in overall nucleotide similarity to SARS-CoV-2 than RaTG13 ( Temmam et al.\n, 2022 ) .\nThe most recently discovered of these close relatives are seven bat viruses ( two are incomplete virus sequences ) from northern Laos ( Temmam et al.\n, 2022 ) .\nThese Laotian viruses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , BANAL-116 , BANAL-236 , BANAL-242 and BANAL-247 .\nGenome comparisons by these latter authors , of all the members of the nCoV clade , including these newest viruses , let them estimate which among these 19 wild coronaviruses have extensive segments of their genomes that are statistically closer in sequence to human SARS-CoV-2 than the others .\nFive of the 19 viruses can make a clear claim to be closest for at least one stretch of its genome : BANAL-52 , BANAL-103 , RaTG13 , and two viruses from S. Yunnan called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al.\n, Figure 2 ) .\nRegardless of whether one favours a lab leak or a natural origin , these five viruses collectively represent the most plausible currently known ancestors for the backbone of SARS-CoV-2 .\nA key finding of this work is that SARS-CoV-2 is therefore a mosaic genome .\nIt was created through genetic recombination and no single currently known virus is its one true ancestor .\nA second implication is that all 19 members of the clade have a similarly complex history of recent and ancient recombination-they are all mosaics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally surprising given that coronaviruses recombine extremely readily ( Makino et al.\n, 1986 ) .\nA third crucial inference of this analysis is that the five most plausible candidates for its parent all come from bats and from a quite small geographic region spanning southern Yunnan , in China , and its neighbour , northern Laos .\nThe longest axis of this region is 500 Km .\nThis geographic concentration of all its closest relatives is also of high consequence for understanding the origin of SARS-CoV-2 .\nIt means that S. Yunnan/N @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virus closely related to SARS-CoV-2 likely exited ( by whatever means ) its bat host .\nAssuming no human intervention , the jump from a bat established the virus in a new host species ( either a human host or another animal ) on its way to becoming SARS-CoV-2 itself .\nVery importantly , this region where the initial jump from bats occurred includes the Mojiang mine .\nMuch of this is detailed in an article we wrote , in August 2021 , on the phylogeography of newly discovered bat coronaviruses .\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a consequence of these new data points , neither we nor anyone else currently considers that SARS-CoV-2 evolved from RaTG13 \u2018 directly \u2019 ( i.e .\nthat RaTG13 is the only parent ) .\nSo , while Rambaut \u2019 s tweets , and even more so the thread below them , imply that we currently believe SARS-CoV-2 is directly descended from RaTG13 , we do not .\nHis supposed debunking is thus just an attack on a straw man .\nFor the record , a long time ago , in July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mojiang Miner Passage theory , we did propose that RaTG13 was the direct ancestor since , at the time , it was the closest known relative and there was then no clear evidence for recombination between viruses .\nBut we were also careful to leave room in the text ( in several passages ) for the subsequent discovery of viruses more closely related to SARS-CoV-2 .\nFor example , we noted that any virus present in the mine could have contributed genetic material to SARS-CoV-2 .\nWe also noted that , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it contained numerous coronaviruses and any of these ( or other unsampled ones ) could have recombined to contribute to the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 .\nAnd Rambaut may have forgotten that , just two weeks after our MMP proposal appeared ( in July 2020 ) , he himself co-authored a paper reaching the identical conclusion\u2013that , given the data then available , RaTG13 was the apparent direct ancestor : \u201d SARS-CoV-2 itself is not a recombinant of any sarbecoviruses detected to date.\n\u201d So , at that time , direct descent of SARS-CoV-2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parsimonious view .\nRambaut even held it himself .\nBut there is a more important logical flaw in Rambaut \u2019 s tweets .\nIt is their implication that the question of direct or indirect descent is even important .\nThe key elements of the MMP theory are that 1 ) the miners were infected with bat coronaviruses acquired in the mine and 2 ) that a humanised coronavirus evolved inside them and was brought to Wuhan in the medical samples taken from them .\nSo , had we hypothesised incorrectly precisely which coronavirus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would not matter\u2013such an error would not refute the theory itself .\nRambaut \u2019 s \u2018 direct descent \u2019 criticism is thus doubly faulty .\nIt is wrong and irrelevant .\nNevertheless , Rambaut is a black belt in virus evolution .\nPhylogenetics is his full-time profession .\nHe even invents the software with which it is done .\nConsequently , it seemed unlikely that he would be entirely ignorant of his errors .\nSo , I felt it was important to push him .\nMaybe , if prodded , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MMP ?\nOr maybe he would make more revealing errors ?\nAnd , if he truly had solid criticisms , we could improve or discard our theory as appropriate .\nIf , on the other hand , he had none , then Andrew Rambaut , the arguably best-informed and most respected denier of lab leak origin theories , would stand exposed .\nA leading scientist exposed as incapable of substantiating his glib online dismissals .\nSimilarly , his repeated ignoring of plausible lab leak theories in high-profile papers like the recent \u2018 critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be unjustifiable ( Holmes et al.\n, 2021 ) .\nHe would be guilty of very bad faith indeed .\nAs a first step , we quickly tweeted back : The tweet was primarily to indicate what we considered was his primary mistake , but the reference to Temmam et al was also a signal that we knew the evidence base , including the newest discoveries from Laos .\nA few minutes later , Rambaut replied with a somewhat different argument : However , this too is a straw man .\nWhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if one considers the other viruses in the nCoV clade , none of them is a true ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 .\nSo Rambaut was at least accepting that we were not defending direct descent from RaTG13 .\nInstead , he was transitioning to a different line of attack , that \u201c SC2 \u201d ( SARS-CoV-2 ) can \u2019 t have been created even from a \u201c combination of viruses we know about \u201d .\nTo understand the plausibility of Rambaut \u2019 s new point it helps to consider the subtleties of the specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own proposed evolutionary history of SARS-CoV-2 .\nTheir phrasing is slightly awkward , but for a purpose .\nThey wrote ( note below that R. malayanus , R. pusillus and R. affinis are the Rhinolophid bat species these viruses were found in ) : \u201c SARS-CoV-2 presents a mosaic genome , to which contributed more than five sequences close to sequences published or determined during this study : R. malayanus RmYN02 and R. pusillus RpYN06 viruses found in China in 2019 , R. affinis RaTG13 coronavirus found in China in 2013 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BANAL- 103 found in North Laos in 2020 ( this study ) .\n\u201d ( Temmam et al.\n, 2022 ) The passage states that SARS-CoV-2 is a mosaic but also that it is not simply a mosaic of the viruses we know of .\nThe reason for making this distinction is that the exact viruses we know of probably didn \u2019 t exist at the time either of the spillover or when the various recombination events leading to SARS-CoV-2 occurred .\nThis is why Temmam et al .\ncarefully added the caveat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistaking their mosaic suggestion for a simplistic cut-and-paste type scenario .\nSo , as a teaching point , it is valid for Rambaut to point out that SARS-CoV-2 can not be a simple cut-and-paste mosaic .\nBut no one with even a moderate understanding of virus evolution is \u201c imagining \u201d this .\nCertainly not ourselves .\nOnce again , Rambaut has taken aim at a straw man .\nOnce again too , Rambaut takes the ad hominem option : imputing naivet\u00e9 on our part .\nFor his next move , Rambaut changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no need for the MMP theory : Here , we disagree again .\nThe first part of my reply below points out that , even aside from the origin of the backbone of the virus , there are multiple ongoing mysteries pertaining to the origin of SARS-CoV-2 that the MMP theory can solve : ( FCS is shorthand for the Furin Cleavage Site .\nThis is the short protein cleavage motif crucial to human infection and whose surprising presence in SARS-CoV-2 has caused the Fauci group , David Baltimore , and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nNevertheless , the main focus of our exchange was the provenance of SARS-CoV-2 \u2019 s backbone ; and , by saying there was \u201c no need \u201d for the MMP theory , it seemed there was a genuine major difference between us .\nWhen we initially formulated the MMP theory , the genetic gap between SARS-CoV-2 and its nearest known relative ( at the time RaTG13 ) was 1140 nucleotides ( 3.8 % of the SARS-CoV-2 genome ) .\nIf , in line with Temmam et al.\n, we assume that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to BANAL-52 , BANAL-103 , RaTG13 , RmYN02 , and RpYN06 , then the genetic gap from SARS-CoV-2 to its wild relatives has shrunk to around 800 nucleotide differences ( i.e .\n2.4 % of the SARS-CoV-2 genome ) .\nNot all of this gap has to evolve in the miners .\nIt is normal , when thinking about evolution at this level of detail , to assume the existence of an entity , in this case a virus , known as the Most Recent Common Ancestor ( MRCA ) .\nFor example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly from chimps or gorillas ( nor vice versa ) ; rather , we evolved from a hypothetical predecessor species that perhaps resembled humans and chimpanzees equally .\nThis predecessor is the MRCA of chimps and humans .\nAn MRCA implies that , of the nucleotide differences between chimps and humans , some accumulated as the MRCA evolved into a chimp and the rest accumulated during the transition between the MRCA and humans .\nOther things being equal , half of the mutations by which any two species differ will lie on each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the MMP theory is true , the branch point likely occurred at or before infection of the miners .\nHence , around 400 nucleotide mutations ( half of 800 ) likely occurred in the miners .\nIn principle , the same span could also have been bridged during passaging in lab animals and cell cultures or , as Rambaut prefers , as part of a natural zoonosis .\nWhichever , it is unclear why 400 nucleotides , which is over 1 % of the virus genome , should not be considered a sizeable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twitter exchange continued on a while longer .\nIt can be seen in full here ; ( it could , until Andrew Rambaut deleted his account ) ; but the essential point is that Andrew Rambaut never provided a clear or substantive refutation of the MMP theory .\nFor all his phylogenetic maneuvering and aggressive language , he fired only blanks and his targets were straw men and red herrings .\nGiven his expertise as the grand expert on coronavirus evolution , this absence of a substantive argument is hugely significant .\nApparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Fauci in-group and prolific author of high-profile analyses concluding that COVID-19 has a natural origin , knows no decisive scientific or biological argument against the MMP theory .\nNevertheless , he was willing to loudly denounce it with faux arguments .\nOther criticisms of the MMP theory Still , the ultimate significance of all this for the MMP theory depends also on there not being other scientific challenges that refute it , ones that are perhaps outside of Rambaut \u2019 s expertise .\nThere are two such potential challenges .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no coronavirus was ever detected in the miners \u2019 serum samples , an the assertion first made in the addendum to Zhou P. et al.\n, ( 2020 ) .\nThe second claim is that the miners had a fungal infection .\nClose inspection of both claims shows that they too are seriously flawed .\nIn the case of the proposed fungal infection , there is first the fact that the claim of a fungal infection has ( at least in English ) never been made directly by Zheng-li Shi of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know .\nInstead , the claim was initially made on her behalf by journalist Jane Qiu , who interviewed Zheng-li Shi for Scientific American .\nThis indirectness would not matter if actual scientific evidence was offered in its support , but it never has been .\nThe obvious place to provide this support was the Zhou addendum noted above , yet WIV scientists provided none .\nAs for what virus , if any , was detected in the samples taken from the miners , Dr Shi and her co-authors have only ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that addendum .\nThe statements in it are critical since they have been widely taken as a refutation of the MMP theory .\nHowever , careful reading of the addendum reveals no direct denial that a coronavirus was found .\nInstead , the addendum merely states that the results of specific tests on specific samples yielded negative results .\nThe central question\u2013whether or not the miners were infected with any novel coronavirus , is thereby dodged .\nMoreover , contrary to all scientific norms , the methods used for the experimental tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ samples are not described and their results are not shown .\nIt is both relevant and legitimate to raise this because WIV scientists have a history of omitting crucial scientific information .\nIn their first ever publication on SARS-CoV-2 ( Zhou P. et al.\n, 2020 ) , Zheng-li Shi \u2019 s group failed to mention that RaTG13 was obtained at the site of a disease outbreak ( i.e .\nthe Mojiang mine ) and the authors also implied , falsely , that RaTG13 had only just been sequenced and studied .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to note the presence of a furin cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 .\nThis omission has been noted before , but it looks much stranger now , in the light of their own DARPA grant proposal ( recently released ) to add furin cleavage sites to wild coronaviruses .\nThese three facts , had they been revealed at the time , would doubtless have transformed early discussions of COVID-19 \u2019 s origin .\nThe indirectness of the addendum is a crucial matter .\nAs we have previously reported , three other scientific sources , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Masters \u2019 thesis of Li Xu , the PhD thesis of Canping Huang , and George Gao , head of China \u2019 s CDC ) , all assert that tests done at the WIV did find evidence of a coronavirus infection in samples from the miners .\nVery recently , the same Jane Qiu has claimed on behalf of Dr Shi , that the discrepant conclusions arose from false positive results .\nHere again , identical caveats apply ; Dr Shi is not quoted directly and no scientific evidence is presented for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was it concluded that these results were false positives ?\nCan the data or the samples not be shared ?\nIf there was no indication of coronavirus infection in the miners , why did so many teams of virologists , especially corona-researchers , sample the mine , especially its bats , so intensively and for many consecutive years thereafter ?\nThese and many other questions remain , casting doubt on almost every aspect of the WIV \u2019 s account of the mine outbreak .\nUltimately , in the eighteen months since we first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find a clear or substantive reason to dismiss the Mojiang Miners Passage theory .\nEven the strongest criticisms of it are , at best , unsubstantiated .\nThe rest are ad hominems or irrelevant .\nInstead , all of the evidence that has subsequently emerged is either consistent with the theory that SARS-CoV-2 evolved in the miners or has reinforced it .\nFor example , the MMP theory implies a bat-to-human spillover with no intermediate animal .\nFor this reason it is noteworthy that still no mammalian intermediate host has been identified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Northern Laos that are highly related to SARS-CoV-2 in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein and that also infect human cells with high efficiency .\nThis shows the existence of naturally occurring spike proteins\u2013not far from the mine\u2013that are competent to jump directly into humans ; and a jump directly into human cells is what the MMP theory relies on .\nThe MMP theory therefore remains fully viable .\nIt is not only entirely plausible , it is the single most parsimonious explanation for the principle tasks of every COVID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single spillover , in Wuhan , of a highly human-adapted SARS-related coronavirus 1700 Km from its natural home .\nAs we recently demonstrated , this situation is not changed at all by two recent preprints that were widely but incorrectly construed in the media as confirming that the Huanan market was the site of several natural spillovers from an unknown host ( Pekar et al.\n, 2022 ; Worobey et al.\n, 2022 ) .\nAnd who are the senior authors of these two papers ( Pekar et al.\n, 2022 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet again attempt to shoehorn ill fitting data into a zoonotic theory ?\nIt should by now be no surprise that the Worobey senior authors are Holmes , Garry , Andersen and Rambaut\u00ad\u2013all members of the original Fauci in-group and Pekar et al .\nis authored by these four plus Michael Worobey and Joel Wertheim .\nOver two years after SARS-CoV-2 first emerged in Wuhan , we can perceive that Fauci \u2019 s COVID

but lives were also lost far afield .\nEbola cases were detected in Nigeria , Senegal , Mali , Spain , the UK , and the U.S .\nThis international spread unleashed its own , albeit fairly short-lived , panic .\nThe infectious agent that caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zaire species of Ebola virus ( sometimes called ZEBOV and sometimes just Ebola ) , which has a fatality rate of up to 90 percent ( Feldmann and Geisbert , 2011 ) .\nThe orthodox story of the outbreaks \u2019 origin remains the one given at the time by the global media .\nIn the U.S. , the Atlantic ran \u201c The Beautiful Tree , the Bats , and the Boy Who Brought Ebola.\n\u201d The UK Independent led with \u201c Ebola outbreak : Two-year-old boy from tiny Guinea village was first to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree stump.\n\u201d The BBC filed : \u201c First Ebola boy likely infected by playing in bat tree \u201d and Canada \u2019 s Toronto Star informed its readers \u201c Scientists trace Ebola outbreak to a tree where children play \u201c .\nWhile disagreeing whether it was a \u201c stump \u201d or a \u201c beautiful tree \u201d , the media all concurred on one African boy and the bats .\nThe primary source for these accounts was a research paper that appeared on December 30th , 2014 in the journal EMBO Molecular Medicine ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Titled \u201c Investigating the zoonotic origin of the West African Ebola epidemic \u201c , the paper begins : \u201c The severe Ebola virus disease epidemic occurring in West Africa stems from a single zoonotic transmission event to a 2\u2010year\u2010old boy in Meliandou , Guinea.\n\u201d Their claimed patient zero , Emile Ouamouno , allegedly caught Ebola after playing with , or maybe hunting , bats .\nPerhaps dissuaded by the definitive opening sentence , the media seems not to have enquired at the time into what evidence supported this narrative .\nThis was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed grounds for confidence in these scientists .\nThe senior author was Fabian Leendertz of the prestigious Robert Koch Institute in Germany .\nLeendertz is a renowned virus hunter best known as a member of the WHO team that reported , in March 2021 , on the origins of COVID-19 .\nMissing evidence : the search for a zoonosis in Meliandou For their investigation , the Leendertz team surveyed bats in the area surrounding Meliandou .\nBats were chosen since they were considered the presumptive reservoir host of Zaire Ebola viruses ( Leroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al , 2009 ; Pigott et al.\n, 2014 ) .\nSamples of bat blood and bat tissue were collected from 159 individuals of 13 bat species .\nHowever , the results were uniformly negative : \u201c No EBOV RNA was detected in any of the PCR-tested bat samples [ and ] attempts to demonstrate the presence of IgG antibodies against Ebola viruses were inconclusive ( data not shown ) .\n\u201d Trying another tack , the authors knew that outbreaks of Zaire Ebola are sometimes correlated with mass die-offs of forest mammals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leroy et al.\n, 2004 ) .\nHowever , no evidence for mammal declines could be found near Meliandou : \u201c [ these results ] suggest they have not experienced a major decline ; in fact , carnivore and chimpanzee ( Pan troglodytes verus ) populations may have increased.\n\u201d All-told , the Leendertz team found no sign whatever of Ebola in the area around Meliandou .\nWhat of Emile ?\nThe Leendertz team concluded that Emile and his mother , who was eight months pregnant at the time , were both Ebola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also died .\nThey did not note , however , that Emile \u2019 s primary caregiver at the time ( probably because of the pregnancy ) was his father , who never became sick .\nMoreover , no blood or other samples were ever taken from any of these suspected cases .\nHence no laboratory evidence exists for any of them having had Ebola and so these diagnoses rest on symptoms alone .\nThis is highly significant because the symptoms of Ebola are very variable .\nEven when severe , they overlap with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa , including malaria , cholera , and Lassa fever .\nIt is therefore generally agreed that Zaire Ebola can not be diagnosed without genome sequencing or other lab tests ( Gire et al.\n, 2014 ) .\nThese tests were not available until much later in the outbreak .\nThus the Leendertz investigation detected no Ebola in bats or other animals in the vicinity of Meliandou , nor did they uncover any other evidence that an Ebola outbreak had occurred in the region .\nThey also found no evidence that Emile or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor even was there a clear indication that Emile had any contact with a bat or the now infamous tree .\nSuch findings did not warrant anything like the absolute certitude of the opening sentence of their report .\nRather , the evidence collected by the Leendertz team was , if anything , against Ebola having been in Meliandou at that time .\nChernoh Bah , an independent journalist from Sierra Leone , wrote a book on the 2014 Ebola outbreak and visited Meliandou .\nBah found that : \u201c Local health workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual cause of his [ Emile \u2019 s ] death.\n\u201d While in Meliandou , Chernoh Bah also interviewed Emile \u2019 s father .\nAccording to Bah , the Leendertz team ( who never claimed to have interviewed the father ) made a crucial error : \u201c The child was actually 18 months old when he died.\n\u201d Bah confirmed this assessment in an interview with Independent Science News .\nThis age is also accepted by the US CDC and was independently confirmed by Reuters journalists , who also interviewed Emile \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be noted , is crucial to the entire outbreak narrative .\nAs Emile \u2019 s father told Reuters : \u201c Emile was too young to eat bats , and he was too small to be playing in the bush all on his own .\nHe was always with his mother.\n\u201d Bah also identified another apparent error : that Emile had four siblings who never became sick .\nThese siblings are not mentioned anywhere in the scientific literature .\nThe wider context is also important for weighing these contending accounts .\nSome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linked with hunting , but only once has an Ebola outbreak been linked to handling or consumption of bats , and then only tentatively ( Leroy et al.\n, 2009 ) .\nThus , although catching and eating bats is common in parts of Africa , a clear precedent for their passing Ebola to humans does not exist .\nFurther , although some bats appear to carry antibodies against Ebola viruses , only intact Bombali Ebola ( a different virus species in the Ebola genus ) has ever been isolated from a bat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al.\n, 2005 ; Pigott et al.\n, 2014 ; Goldstein et al.\n, 2018 ; Forbes et al.\n, 2019 ) .\nBombali is a species of Ebola that does not infect humans .\nTaken together , this suggests that bats rarely carry Ebola viruses and when they do it is in small quantities .\nThis context makes it somewhat surprising that Sa\u00e9z et al .\nascribed the 2014 outbreak ( without supporting evidence ) to contact with bats .\nIndeed , Fabian Leendertz now doubts that bats are true reservoirs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2016 ) .\nGiven the general want of evidence , one wonders by what exact process such poorly supported claims were transmuted into international headlines .\nThe missing epidemiology connecting Emile to the first proven Ebola cases Emile Ouamouno died in Meliandou , Guinea , on Dec 6th , 2013 ( Sa\u00e9z et al .\n2014 ; Baize et al.\n, 2014 ) .\nRelying on hospital records and interviews , a putative transmission chain connecting Emile to ( most of ) the earliest confirmed cases was published in the New England Journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2014 ) .\nThe proposed epidemiological chain is shown in full in figure 2 ( reproduced from Baize et al.\n, 2014 ) .\nIn figure 2 , suspected cases are indicated by an \u2018 S \u2019 while patients confirmed by laboratory test are denoted with a \u2018 C \u2019 for \u2018 confirmed \u2019 ( and also given a red spot ) .\nThis makes Emile \u2018 S1 \u2019 in the standard narrative .\nThese authors acknowledge that the dashed connections in figure 2 represent epidemiological links that \u201c are not well established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note that Emile connects to the first confirmed cases only via dashed lines .\nThe next thing to understand about the standard epidemiological account is that laboratory tests for Ebola disease only became available in West Africa on March 21st , 2014 .\nEvery step in the infection chain in figure 2 ( except when C12 infected C14 ) relies on symptoms alone .\nThus even the solid lines in figure 2 are highly provisional too .\nThe third important consideration is that there are two alternate versions of Baize et al .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ published by the NEJM is represented by figure 2 .\nThe version available now ( dated July 12 , 2022 ) on the NEJM website states that the first ( peer-reviewed ) version of the article was \u201c preliminary \u201d .\nThe major change in the final text was to state that a second epidemiological investigation concluded death dates for S1 ( Emile ) , S2 , S3 and S4 were later by up to 3-4 weeks ( Baize et al.\n, 2014 ) .\nHowever , no information about this second investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for why it was necessary and it contradicts figure 2 ( which remains unchanged in the new version of the paper ) .\nIt is also never stated which of the two conclusions , if any , the authors themselves favour .\nThis epidemiological uncertainty manifests even at later dates and among confirmed cases .\nFor example , figure 2 does not include patient C3 , who was the first confirmed Ebola death ( on March 17th ) at Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou hospital .\nThis is the nearest hospital to Meliandou , 12 km away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the next two deaths ( C4 on March 18th ) at Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou hospital ( both are therefore only noted in Table 1 of Baize and not figure 2 ) .\nThis insufficiency of concrete data surrounding the very early cases , plus the lengthy time interval separating Emile \u2019 s death in December from the first confirmed cases in mid-March and the delayed subsequent investigations cast considerable doubt on the validity of the whole chain .\nThere are other problems too .\nAs can be seen in figure 2 , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by laboratory tests , the earliest deaths were not recorded at Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou hospital at all .\nDespite being labeled with higher numbers ( as if they were later in the outbreak ) , the four earliest deaths among confirmed cases were C12 ( d. Feb 28th ) , C13 ( d. March 12th ) , C8 ( d. March 16th ) , and C14 ( d. March 16th ) .\nThese patients all presented at Macenta hospital which is over 100 km east of both Meliandou and Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou ( see figure 1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earliest confirmed deaths does not obviously suggest an epicentre in Meliandou .\nSo , although Baize et al .\nconducted epidemiological investigations , this rooting of the outbreak is , in reality , highly provisional .\nLast , but perhaps not least , since the diagnoses are mostly unconfirmed , the credibility of the epidemiological chain in figure 2 rests heavily on the researchers \u2019 claims to have interviewed eyewitnesses , yet Emile \u2019 s father contradicted them in 2015 , telling Reuters : Zaire Ebola in 2014 : the prima facie case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first confirmed by laboratory tests in mid-March 2014 , persistent rumours in the region linked the outbreak to a US-run research laboratory in Kenema , Sierra Leone ( Wilkinson , 2017 ) .\nThis facility studies viral hemorrhagic diseases , of which Ebola is one .\nKenema is 140 km southwest of Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou and the same distance from Macenta and a little farther from Nz\u00e9r\u00e9kor\u00e9 ( see figure 1 , above ) .\nAll these towns sit close to or fairly close to the border where Guinea , Sierra Leone and Liberia meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounds of the Kenema Government Hospital ( KGH ) .\nThe lab , but not the hospital , has been operated by the US-based Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Consortium ( VHFC ) since 2010 .\nThough there is an interesting continuity\u2013a viral hemorrhagic fever laboratory was run by the US CDC in Kenema between 1976 up to Sierra Leone \u2019 s civil war in the 1990s .\nThe president and founder of the VHFC is virologist Robert ( Bob ) Garry of Tulane University .\nIn response to lab origin speculation , Garry gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lab in an interview with Politifact published on 15 October , 2014 , titled \u201c 5 falsehoods about Ebola \u201c .\nGarry told his interviewer , Aaron Sharockman : \u201c We were there working 10 years and then Ebola came here.\n\u201d The possibility of a lab origin never gained much attention outside Africa .\nBut the 2014 Ebola outbreak was enigmatic on several key grounds .\nOne puzzle was noted by the Leendertz group : \u201c [ The ] current epidemic represents the first proven emergence of Zaire Ebola virus in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2014 ) The Zaire species of Ebola is the most lethal ( to humans ) of all the members of the Ebola genus .\nThis genus also includes other Ebola-like viruses : Bundibugyo virus , Tai Forest Virus , Reston Ebola , Bombali Ebola , and Sudan Ebola .\nAs its name implies , all prior outbreaks of Zaire Ebola were in the central African equatorial zone ( the Congo basin ) ( Feldmann and Geisbert , 2011 ) .\nAt its closest , this classical Zairean Ebola zone is 3,000 km @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s appearance in West Africa was a striking and very unexpected development .\nHow might it have reached West Africa ?\nEbola is not highly contagious .\nTransmission normally requires direct contact with the body fluids of an infected host .\nWith such weak infectious properties and poor spreading potential , how could it move so far ?\nMoreover , although often lethal and hence relatively easy to spot when it emerges , the virus caused no known human or animal outbreaks en route from its traditional Congo refuge .\nA second major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phylogenetic analysis has shown unambiguously that the 2014 outbreak resulted from a single jump into humans ( Gire et al.\n, 2014 ; Dudas and Rambaut , 2014 ) .\nZoonotic outbreaks , including most past Ebola outbreaks , typically feature multiple jumps to humans from an animal source ( Feldmann and Geisbert , 2011 ) .\nSingle jumps , however , are consistent with lab origins and are often considered a red flag for that possibility ( Nakajima et al.\n, 1978 ) .\nThe reason is that researchers often work with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have found is particularly easy to replicate in the laboratory , whereas natural populations are typically diverse .\nThis difference provides a genetic signal for distinguishing natural origins from laboratory ones .\nLast , Zaire Ebola is the species favoured by civilian and military research labs for studying Ebola-type viruses .\nIt is their focus because of its high mortality rate and thus biowarfare potential .\nJournalist Chernoh Bah is now a graduate student at Northwestern University .\nNoting the gap between the weakness of the Leendertz account of the outbreak origin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baize too ) and the forcefulness with which the Emile narrative was asserted by western scientists and western media , he wrote : \u201c it is difficult not to interpret the \u2018 zoonotic origin of the West African Ebola epidemic \u2019 narrative advanced by Fabian Leendertz and his team as part of a cover-up or obfuscation of the actual chain of events that laid the foundation for the West African Ebola outbreak.\n\u201d ( Chernoh Bah , The Ebola Outbreak in West Africa ) Indeed , the Kenema laboratory merits close inspection as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strain that led to the 2014 outbreak .\nDid the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Consortium study Ebola at Kenema ?\nAccording to its website , the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Consortium is a collaborative project for the study of hemorrhagic fevers and their treatments .\nLassa virus , which is common locally , and the Ebola viruses are the most prominent viral hemorrhagic diseases .\nThe consortium \u2019 s only permanent site is at Kenema .\nProminent institutional members of the VHFC include labs from Harvard University , the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Zalgen , a diagnostics company founded by Robert Garry .\nThough not currently listed as such , in 2014 , Metabiota , the self-described \u201c pandemic threat management \u201d company was a VHFC partner as have been other companies .\nLike Garry , the other VHFC leadership is US-based and includes Kristian Andersen of Scripps Research , Erica Ollmann Saphire , and Pardis Sabeti ( Board Treasurer ) .\nGarry and Andersen are currently highly visible due to their numerous media appearances and scientific articles dismissing SARS-CoV-2 lab-origin hypotheses as baseless conspiracies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2020 ; Worobey et al.\n, 2022 ) .\nIn 2011 , three years before the West African Ebola outbreak , Reuters profiled the research in Kenema at length .\nReaders were told that a \u201c laboratory in southeastern Sierra Leone is an outpost of the U.S. government \u2019 s \u2018 war on terror , \u2019 funded by a surge in bio-defense spending since the airplane and anthrax attacks on New York and Washington a decade ago .\nAmerican research aims to limit the vulnerability of western interests to biological agents.\n\u201d As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior to the September 11 attacks \u2014 the U.S. National Institutes of Health budget for bioterrorism and related research was $ 53 million .\nBut by the fiscal year 2007 the NIH was requesting more than $ 1.9 billion.\n\u201d Reuters concluded that the Kenema labs \u2019 share of that allocation was $ 40 million .\nOn August 25 , 2013 , just months before the Ebola outbreak , the VHFC posted on its website an article titled : \u201c Researchers at the Scripps Research Institute make major advances in the fight against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed but its existence is verifiable using the WayBackMachine .\nNevertheless , the title alone raises some key questions : Why did the VHFC post about Ebola if it wasn \u2019 t working on it at the time ?\nIn particular , what Ebola variant was being studied ?\nWhat was the nature of the experiments ?\nWhy remove the post ?\nThis was not the only time the VHFC appeared to be steering perception of its research towards Lassa fever and away from Ebola in the wake of the outbreak .\nOn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement appeared that referred to the \u201c current Ebola Epicenter of Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou , Guinea \u201d and the collaboration with Metabiota .\nThe statement referenced their \u201c Lassa laboratory at Kenema Government Hospital ( KGH ) \u201d .\nThis is the first reference we have been able to find of the VHFC calling its facility at Kenema the \u201c Lassa Laboratory \u201d .\nThis may be an understandable rhetorical effort to distance themselves from Ebola research .\nBut it raises the question : if the work at Kenema was only on Lassa , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d used for the consortium ( and previously the lab ) , if not to encompass research on related viruses ?\nAnd were such large funding amounts simply for Lassa fever ?\nWe do know that Ebola was important to the VHFC and its partners and a primary interest for at least some of its members .\nIndeed , all the leading US-based researchers of the VHFC , Robert Garry , Kristian Andersen , Erica Ollmann Saphire and Pardis Sabeti have published multiple original research papers on Ebola virus ( e.g .\nLee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al.\n, 2013 ; Murin et al.\n, 2014 ; Guha et al.\n, 2018 ; Gunn et al.\n, 2018 ; Barnes et al.\n, 2020 ) .\nAn Ebola focus also accords with US biosecurity research priorities under whose auspices the Kenema lab is largely funded .\nWhile Lassa fever is an endemic and sometimes debilitating illness , Ebola is a mysterious but highly lethal pathogen associated with the very highest level of biosecurity concerns .\nTwo exemplars are of this personal interest in Ebola are Erica Ollmann Saphire and Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saphire is a VHFC board member from the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in San Diego .\nSaphire \u2019 s main research focus is Ebola .\nIn January 2013 , for instance , a lengthy and hyperbolic profile of her was published by Gary Robbins of the San Diego Union-Tribune : \u201c The Virus Hunter : Erica Ollmann Saphire takes on deadly threats.\n\u201d The piece begins : \u201c Deep in the thicket of west Africa , on a bamboo bridge strung over raging waters , Erica Ollmann Saphire groped through the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out life with ruthless efficiency .\nShe was looking for rodents .\nThe Scripps Research Institute biologist wanted to know how and where her enemy spreads viral hemorrhagic fever : things like Ebola and Lassa , diseases that can kill.\n\u201d The piece notes that Saphire was working on a \u201c species of Ebola \u201d which is \u201c 50-90 percent lethal.\n\u201d This part is not hyperbole\u00ad\u2013since 2006 Saphire has co-authored over 30 publications on Zaire Ebola virus , testament to a longstanding research interest ( e.g .\nBornholdt et al.\n, 2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinical Trial of TKM-Ebola Another example is Thomas Geisbert .\nGeisbert is now at the University of Texas Medical Branch , but formerly he was at the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease ( USAMRIID ) in Maryland , also known as Fort Detrick .\nIt is the premier US \u201c biodefense \u201d facility .\nOn Dec. 14 , 2014 , Andersen published a post on the VHFC website celebrating Time magazine \u2019 s choices of \u201c VHFC researchers Drs .\nPardis Sabeti and Thomas Geisbert \u201d as \u201c Ebola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the year .\nGeisbert \u2019 s 2014 Time profile is informative .\nCiting Soviet defector Ken Alibek as his authority ( even though Alibek was , by then , widely considered an unreliable source ) , Geisbert told Time readers that the Soviet Union had tried to weaponize Ebola .\nWhile at Fort Detrick , Geisbert and his colleagues had pushed for a US response to Alibek \u2019 s allegations : [ at that period there ] \u201c wasn \u2019 t money or interest or time to take those products across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , everything changed .\nThere was increased funding .\nIt was fortunate for me , because Ebola was my main area of interest .\nWhen all the money became available , we started looking at developing a vaccine .\nThe idea came from Heinz Feldmann , then at the Public Health Agency of Canada ( now at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ) , and the first big success we had was in 2002 or 2003 .\nWe did two back-to-back studies , and this was the first vaccine that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s research was detailed further by Constantine Nana , who wrote a book about the 2014 outbreak : The Ebola Outbreak in West Africa .\nIn the book Nana wrote : \u201c [ Geisbert ] has studied the Ebola virus for more than two decades and spent several years working with the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease at Fort Detrick .\nIn March of 2014 , he was awarded ( together with Profectus Biosciences , Tekmira Pharmaceuticals , and Vanderbilt University Medical Center ) $ 26 million ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the NIH to \u2018 advance treatments of the highly lethal hemorrhagic fever viruses Ebola and Marburg.\n\u2019 In his book , Nana speculated that such research might have led to a leak at Kenema .\nIn particular , Nana cites a product called TKM-Ebola , an RNA-based therapeutic that , according to research published in the Lancet , was a 100 % effective treatment for primates infected with Ebola ( Geisbert et al.\n, 2010 ) .\nThe Lancet work was funded by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency ( part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Zaire Ebola strain , and was a collaboration involving Geisbert and Tekmira Pharmaceuticals .\nIn his Time magazine profile , Geisbert heralded the success he and Tekmira were allegedly having : \u201c I \u2019 ve got shelves and shelves and shelves and shelves of stuff that slow or inhibit growth of Ebola in culture .\nDozens of those protect mice or guinea pigs .\nOnly two worked in nonhuman primates , out of all the studies done in the BSL4 lab \u2014 and those are ZMapp done by Gary Kobinger in Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with biotech company Tekmira .\n\u2026 When you do have success , like when we did the TKM-Ebola study , there is no greater feeling.\n\u201d Based on the Lancet result , Tekmira raised at least $ 140 million from military-related funders .\nThis allowed them , around the time of the outbreak , to run a series of Phase I and Phase II clinical trials of different versions of TKM-Ebola .\nFor instance , on Dec. 13 , 2013 , Tekmira announced a study in humans and on Jan. 14 , 2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titled \u201c Tekmira Doses First Subject in Human Clinical Trial of TKM-Ebola \u201d .\nAs reported by the New York Times in June 2015 , at least one phase II trial was definitely conducted in Sierra Leone .\nFunded by the UK \u2019 s Wellcome Trust , this one was halted because , according to Tekmira , the drug was \u201c not likely to demonstrate an overall therapeutic benefit \u201d .\nThis trial was later published in a scientific journal and described as occurring at Port Loko , 190 km northwest of Kenema @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFrom the limited descriptions available , one of these trials fits the timing required for it to have triggered the 2014 Ebola outbreak but none of them fits the location .\nHowever , the data is incomplete ; for his book , Constantine Nana corresponded with the lead investigator in the Port Loko Phase II trial ,

investigate , reached similar conclusions .\nIn an email about the Kenema lab he wrote : \u201c The cross contamination potential is huge and quite frankly unacceptable.\n\u201d Thus , there seems to have been a pattern at Kenema of lax biosafety procedures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Responding to international emergency requests to attend an outbreak of then unknown cause , MSF arrived in Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou , Guinea , on March 18th , 2014 .\nIt was their diagnostic efforts that first confirmed the presence of Ebola .\nAfter the outbreak had waned , MSF wrote a report on the Ebola outbreak response that was highly critical of members of the VHFC .\nThe MSF report refers to their early suspicions that , despite the absence of positive test results from Sierra Leone , Ebola was nevertheless present : \u201c The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconnected chains of transmission in different locations in the Guin\u00e9e foresti\u00e8re region , many of whom had family in neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone.\n\u201d \u201c The problem initially was not so much the number of cases , but that the hot-spots were spread out in so many locations , \u201d In other words , the outbreak in Guinea did not resemble a recent outbreak with a simple epicentre , as proposed by the Leendertz and Baize papers .\nInstead , what MSF found when they arrived in Guinea were many cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which appeared to originate from neighbouring Sierra Leone .\n\u201c Meanwhile , there was concern all along about the puzzling absence of confirmed cases over the border in Sierra Leone.\n\u201d MSF had an explanation for this absence : \u201c From the onset of the epidemic , the U.S. biotechnology company Metabiota and Tulane University , partners of Sierra Leone \u2019 s Kenema hospital , had the lead in supporting Sierra Leone \u2019 s Ministry of Health in investigating suspected cases .\nTheir investigations came back Ebola negative , while their ongoing surveillance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ebola that had emerged in the country.\n\u201d MSF \u2019 s suggestion that the Kenema lab was missing Ebola cases accords with AP \u2019 s investigation in Sierra Leone .\nAP reporters obtained an email sent by WHO Ebola coordinator Philippe Barboza on 8th Aug , 2014 .\nIt stated : [ Metabiota staffers ] \u201c are systematically obstructing any attempt to improve the existing surveillance system and there are a lot of improvement ( s ) needed \u201d Another WHO official , outbreak specialist Eric Bertherat , had already reached similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17th he told colleagues there was \u201c no tracking of the samples \u201d and \u201c absolutely no control on what is being done \u201c .\nThe result was \u201c total confusion \u201c .\nLater , a paper about the outbreak authored by Bertherat , Barboza , and others , referred to \u201c considerable unmonitored transmission in the early months of the epidemic \u201d and the withholding of data from the authors by Metabiota ( Senga et al.\n, 2017 ) .\nAnd Sylvia Blyden , a senior advisor to the Sierra Leone Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the whole region.\n\u201d When MSF did at last get permission to work in Sierra Leone , they were taken by surprise : \u201c When we set up operations in Kailahun [ a town equidistant between Kenema and Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou ] , we realised we were already too late .\nThere were cases everywhere , and we built the centre with 60 beds , rather than the 20 we started with in Guinea , \u201d said MSF \u2019 s Anja Wolz .\nBut , just like the WHO , MSF got no cooperation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health and the partners of Kenema hospital refused to share data or lists of contacts with us , so we were working in the dark while cases just kept coming in.\n\u201d MSF agreed with Sylvia Blyden that failure at Kenema had major repercussions : \u201c After a short period of raised hopes in May as cases appeared to be declining in Guinea and Liberia , the hidden outbreak in Sierra Leone mushroomed and reignited the outbreak for its neighbours.\n\u201d This sentence is the second reference in MSF \u2019 s report to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d .\nApparently , MSF thought that the failure to report cases from Sierra Leone was not a simple bungle .\nThese independent investigations , and the MSF report in particular , raise fundamental questions : Did the outbreak really begin in Guinea ?\nOr did it in fact start in Sierra Leone ?\nDid early testing and diagnostic failings in Sierra Leone bring about a narrative that placed the origin across the border in Guinea ?\nGiven the intentionality imputed by many of these witnesses to the failings in Sierra Leone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were they intended to divert attention away from the Kenema lab ?\nPhylogenetic analysis of the Ebola 2014 outbreak contradicts the standard narrative To this day , the bat-tree-boy narrative still stands as the leading explanation for the West African Ebola outbreak of 2014 ( Holmes et al.\n, 2016 ) .\nEven though no additional evidence in its favour has emerged since ( such as the discovery of a natural source of Ebola in West Africa , despite intensive searching of wildlife ) , only very rarely do researchers even note that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anecdotal \u201d ( Spengler et al.\n, 2016 ) .\nThe 2014 Ebola outbreak ( which is now referred to as the Makona strain of Ebola ) marked the full debut of mass viral genome sequencing during an outbreak .\nIn all , about 5 percent of confirmed Ebola cases in West Africa were sequenced , with each sequence having sampling time and location data attached to it .\nThe total data set contains about 1,500 Ebola genomes , including from some of the earliest known cases .\nPhylogenetic analysis is a set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast quantity of genetic information .\nIt can give detailed insights into the timing and connection between cases and so phylogenies have the potential to resolve where and when the virus emerged ( see e.g .\nHolmes et al.\n, 2016 ) .\nFor example , phylogenetic analysis has been used to show instances of the disease crossing and re-crossing the borders between Guinea , Sierra Leone and Liberia , and in which direction ( Dudas et al.\n, 2017 ) .\nThis genetic information is now publicly available .\nIt can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virology website Nextstrain.org , which is the source of the phylogenies in the figures below .\nSince the on-the-ground epidemiology is clearly uncertain , the chief scientific reason for not taking the possibility of a lab origin seriously has been that a large number of phylogenetic analyses have been performed and these have consistently stated that the origin was unambiguously in Guinea ( Dudas and Rambaut , 2014 ; Baize et al.\n, 2014 ; Gire et al.\n, 2014 ; Carroll et al.\n, 2015 ; Hoenen et al.\n, 2015 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ et al.\n, 2015 ; Park et al.\n, 2015 ; Simon-Lori\u00e9re et al.\n, 2015 ; Quick et al.\n, 2016 ; Tong et al.\n, 2016 ; Arias et al.\n, 2016 ; Holmes et al.\n, 2016 ; Dudas et al.\n, 2017 ) .\nAt first glance it seems clear why this should be .\nFigure 4 is a screenshot of the whole 2014 Ebola outbreak .\nIt is taken from Nextstrain \u2019 s interactive Ebola phylogeny page .\n( Note : For this screenshot , and all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were selected to highlight sampling dates and their country of origin . )\nIn Nextstrain ( and thus figure 4 and succeeding figures ) , spots correspond to individual Ebola genomes sampled from single patients .\nGreen spots are those diagnosed in Guinea ; blue spots are patients diagnosed in Sierra Leone ; and orange spots are cases from Liberia .\nThe lines between them indicate inferred evolutionary connections between each sampled genome , resulting in a phylogenetic tree .\nThe colours of these lines reflect an inference .\nThey are Nextstrain \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lineage is found .\nIn figure 4 it can be seen that all the early ( prior to May 25th , 2014 ) sequences map to Guinea .\nPresenting the data this way implies that the root virus of the epidemic ( red arrow at the left ) jumped into humans in Guinea .\nThough superficially simple , this interpretation gives rise to several anomalies , however .\nPhylogenetic anomalies from assigning the root to Guinea As figure 4 showed , beginning very early in the outbreak , the virus became separated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nbranches ) .\nThis bifurcation can be better seen in figure 5 .\nIt is a screenshot of the same webpage but focusing only on the origin .\nIt identifies two separate lineages called here SL-1 and GU-1 .\nOf the two , the GU-1 lineage presents a straightforward case .\nThis lineage arose in Guinea ( the first examples are green spots ) and most descendant viruses are also coloured green .\nThat is to say , from its establishment to its extinction , the GU-1 lineage was almost entirely confined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is an orange ( i.e .\nLiberian ) spot in the GU-1 lineage .\nPresumably , one person infected with a GU-1 lineage virus travelled to Liberia where they were sampled and their genome was sequenced .\nThere is also a small cluster of blue/purple spots dating from early 2015 ( that are not visible in figure 5 ) .\nA cluster implies , similarly , that one infected person took the GU-1 strain to Sierra Leone causing a small outbreak there and some of these descendants were diagnosed and sequenced .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ staying there is to be expected .\nMoreover , from Nextstrain one can see that the GU-1 lineage caused relatively few cases ( compared to the SL-1 lineage ) .\nThis concurs with the standard understanding that MSF brought the Guinea outbreak under control relatively quickly .\nThe upper lineage ( SL-1 ) followed a very different pattern .\nFirst , it was not controlled and became responsible for the majority of cases in the entire West African outbreak .\nThis lineage spread primarily in Sierra Leone but it also spread sporadically into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Guinea , as indicated by its green spots .\nSL-1 was thus responsible for most of the eventual 30,000 cases and most of the 11,000+ Ebola deaths .\nHowever , the SL-1 lineage has a curious feature that is highlighted in figure 6 .\nSL-1 begins with three green ( Guinean ) spots ( Kissidougou C-15 , EM_079410 and EM_079442 ) , but their viral descendants are all blue spots , meaning that these descendants were all Ebola cases diagnosed in Sierra Leone .\nThe orthodox interpretation of this has always been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread into Sierra Leone .\nHowever , looking carefully , this interpretation is difficult to sustain , for three reasons .\nFirst , from the data on the GU-1 lineage we know that a Guinean taking a GU-1 strain of the virus to another country was a rare event .\nIt happened just twice in the 18 months of the outbreak there , once to Liberia and once to Sierra Leone .\nDudas et al .\nasked this question in a different way and they concluded that , in the whole outbreak ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30,000 recorded cases ) , only nine times did anyone with Ebola enter Sierra Leone from Guinea ( Dudas et al .\n2016 ) .\nThe orthodox interpretation nevertheless requires that , among the small handful of initial Guinean cases , one of them took the virus to Sierra Leone .\nSecond , the absence of green spots downstream of the first three indicates that these early Guinean cases failed to infect any further Guineans .\nThirdly , the disappearance of the SL-1 lineage in Guinea coincided in time with its appearance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lineage did not just spread into Sierra Leone , it also , simultaneously , vanished from Guinea Each one of the three requirements of the orthodox view are , on their face , somewhat unlikely .\nTaken together , in science-speak , they represent a non-parsimonious explanation that suggests we might consider alternative ones .\n( As an aside , close inspection of Nextstrain \u2019 s Ebola data shows there are occasional green ( Guinean ) spots in the SL-1 lineage and , later on , minor green outbreaks .\nOne such virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrow in figure 7 below .\nIn principle , any of these green spots in the SL-1 lineage might represent a continuation of a cryptic Guinean SL-1 outbreak .\nHowever , we can be fairly confident that EM_79876 [ sampled June 5th , 2014 ] , and others not shown , are instead independent later cross-border introductions from the outbreak in Sierra Leone .\nThis confidence derives first from the long time intervals between identification of the first three green spots and the appearance of these latter samples [ e.g .\nEM_79876 was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months after its last Guinean ancestor , which was sampled on April 3rd ] , and second because of the high genetic similarity of these downstream green samples to viruses identified in Sierra Leone .\nThis interpretation is confirmed by Nextstrain .\nThis link is to a screenshot showing in close-up how Nextstrain interprets the provenance of the earliest of these green spots in the SL-1 lineage [ EM_79876 and EM_79880 , both sampled June 5th 2014 , and some others ] .\nBy showing these green spots as descending from one or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ algorithm is agreeing with our interpretation : that such green spots are all descendants of viruses found in Sierra Leone , thus they are introductions from there and not indicative of cryptic spread in Guinea ) .\nThus , to recap , the phylogenetic tree of the full epidemic indicates that the SL-1 lineage did not merely spread from Guinea into Sierra Leone but moved wholesale into it .\nWhat that means in practice is that all early patients in Guinea carrying viruses from the SL-1 lineage infected only individuals from Sierra Leone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed home country .\nSuch anomalies should raise eyebrows of an even minimally curious researcher .\nWhy should a root virus first identified in Guinea fail to initiate an outbreak in Guinea ?\nWhy should cases in Guinea start an epidemic in Sierra Leone ?\nAnd why also should the disappearance of the SL-1 lineage from Guinea coincide in time with its appearance in Sierra Leone ?\nThere is a potential simple resolution to this conundrum .\nLet us hypothesise that the three green samples at the root of the SL1 outbreak were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assigned to Guinea instead of Sierra Leone .\nIf one re-labels each of them blue ( i.e .\nSierra Leonean ) then the early stages of the pandemic phylogenetic tree resolve into two branches with no wholesale leap of one lineage into Sierra Leone .\nThere was an origin , which , sometime before sampling started , split into two branches .\nOne branch ( GU-1 ) spread in Guinea and was largely contained ; the other ( SL-1 ) spread in Sierra Leone and was not controlled .\nThis hypothesis simplifies the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good reason for suggesting such misattributions ?\nThere is .\nAccording to the contact tracing described in MSF \u2019 s report , some early cases in Guinea had no connections there but instead appeared to come from Sierra Leone ( which is only 12 miles from Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou ) .\nIf true , though diagnosed in Guinea and therefore attributed to Guinea ( and given green spots by Nextstrain ) , such patients are better understood as part of a Sierra Leone outbreak .\nThe hypothesis is thus that the three early green cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not properly from Guinea but instead represent spillovers from an undetected outbreak in Sierra Leone .\nThese cases were thus labelled green only because they were picked up in Guinea , where sampling and contact tracing were effective .\nAdjusting the tree accordingly provides a solution that accords with the evidence and is parsimonious since it resolves what is an otherwise highly perplexing state of affairs .\nHowever , there is one difficulty .\nFor any cases to have spilled from Sierra Leone in March , 2014 , there must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officially , the first case was not diagnosed there until May 25th , 2014 ( Goba et al.\n, 2016 ) .\nHowever , as the next section will show , there is strong phylogenetic evidence for such an outbreak .\nBefore discussing that evidence , it is imperative to note that assigning these three cases to Sierra Leone has important consequences for locating the origin of the outbreak .\nThe sampling date of one of them ( Kissidougou-C15 ) is March 17th .\nIt is the earliest Ebola Makona genome ever sampled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very earliest cases known .\nSo , just as researchers have used these three samples to deduce that the origin was in Guinea , relabelling them shifts the presumed origin to Sierra Leone .\nThe MSF report provides additional clues as to which of the two countries was the true source of the epidemic .\nDrawing on distinct strands of evidence , MSF suggested that it was Sierra Leone since : ( 1 ) contact tracing showed that some very early cases came from Sierra Leone ; ( 2 ) the outbreak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note also that Baize et al.\n\u2019 s early cases , though located in Guinea , were all at different points along the border with Sierra Leone ) ; ( 3 ) when MSF set up in Kailahun ( in Sierra Leone ) the outbreak was already much worse in Kailahun than was the outbreak in Guinea ; ( 4 ) the MSF report also suggested an outbreak in Sierra Leone was \u2018 hidden \u2019 by poor or absent diagnostic procedures .\nThe email from WHO \u2019 s Phillippe Barboza corroborates this by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Metabiota was \u201c systematically obstructing \u201d surveillance .\nA lack of surveillance and sequencing in Sierra Leone is important .\nIt would suffice to explain why , if there was an outbreak in Sierra Leone that occasionally was spreading into Guinea , no Sierra Leone samples ( blue dots ) occur at the base of the SL-1 lineage .\nThe following section therefore addresses this key question : was there an early outbreak in Sierra Leone ?\nFurther evidence of a hidden outbreak in Sierra Leone Inspection of the genome sequences at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anomaly .\nThe first Ebola genome sequence officially from Sierra Leone is an accession called EM_095 .\nIt was obtained from a patient on May 25th , 2014 .\nThis date is over two months after the first confirmed Guinean cases were sampled .\nThe next day ( May 26th ) two more patient samples were taken in Sierra Leone and later sequenced , these are Ebola accessions G_3677 and EM_096 .\nThe genome of G_3677 differs from EM_095 by four mutations , while EM_096 differs from EM_095 by seven mutations .\nJust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ebola accession G_3670 was obtained from another patient .\nIt differs from EM0_95 by six mutations .\nThe following day ( May 28th ) , G_3679 was obtained .\nIt also differs from EM_095 by six mutations .\nHowever , these six mutations are not the same six mutations as those by which G_3670 differs from EM_095 .\nWhat this genome sequencing indicates is that substantial genetic diversity in the Ebola virus population already existed in Sierra Leone by the time the medics there first started testing .\nThis diversity has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in four days ; rather , it shows that mutations had been building up in an unsampled viral population .\nThus a viral outbreak in Sierra Leone had existed for some considerable time before May 25th .\nSubsequent sequencing efforts in Sierra Leone , which were much more comprehensive , uncovered yet more evidence of early diversity , thus confirming and extending this finding .\nThis high viral diversity existing prior to May 25th is apparent from the Nextstrain phylogenetic tree ( see figure 8 , below ) .\nIt shows up as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to May 25th .\nA bifurcating tree without spots ( i.e .\nsamples ) , as highlighted in figure 8 by the red oval , represents Nextstrain \u2019 s prediction of viral intermediates early in the growth of the SL-1 lineage , even though these were never sampled .\nIt is important to note that this diversity in the SL-1 lineage prior to late May was probably not from any outbreak in neighbouring Guinea at the time .\nThis is because ( as the figures also show ) in Guinea there was abundant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) prior to May 25th .\nIf these or other virus strains had existed in Guinea they would likely have been picked up by the contact tracing and other efforts there , measures we know were comprehensive enough at that time to suppress the Guinea outbreak .\nAs noted above , the scientific literature contains dozens of papers detailing the events of the Ebola Makona outbreak .\nOf those published in high-profile journals , or in any of the fourteen papers presenting a phylogenetic analysis of the outbreak , there is no mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely-cited papers in low-profile journals ( one is even in a \u201c Supplement \u201d ) do acknowledge deficits in early sampling , contact tracing , and case ascertainment efforts in Sierra Leone , i.e .\nat the base of the SL-1 lineage ( Wauquier et al.\n, 2015 ; Goba et al.\n, 2016 ; Senga et al.\n, 2017 ) .\nThough in low-ranking journals , these last three papers are key data points since they represent researchers and epidemiologists in Sierra Leone corroborating MSF \u2019 s assessment of a missing or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFrom the above it seems clear that the orthodox account of a Guinean origin for the Ebola 2014 epidemic is inconsistent on several counts with the accepted phylogenetic tree .\nOne major anomaly is the unexplained early migration of the SL-1 lineage from Guinea into Sierra Leone .\nThe second is the sudden and unexplained appearance in late May and early June 2014 of diverse Ebola strains in Sierra Leone that imply the existence of a substantial undetected outbreak there .\nHowever , these two anomalies are consistent with each other and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the earliest confirmed case ( Kissidougou C\u201315 ) and two others diagnosed in Guinea represent spillovers from Sierra Leone and not an origin in Guinea .\nFurthermore , from MSF \u2019 s report and the WHO emails uncovered by AP , the epidemic is more likely to have begun in Sierra Leone and only later spread into Guinea .\nThis assemblage of evidence is interesting on several counts .\nNot only does it derive from diverse sources\u2013phylogenetics , epidemiology , email correspondences\u2013it also creates a coherent alternative account that fits all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the obvious inference is that the 2014 Ebola outbreak began in Sierra Leone and not Guinea .\nA Sierra Leone origin is not per se a lab origin , however .\nWhat is the origin of the Makona strain ?\nA major question nevertheless remains before considering the possibility of a lab origin\u2013What is the source of the Makona strain ?\nThe Makona strain of Ebola is not a standard or known strain , nor is it similar to any published strain .\nIt is novel , having approximately 400 mutations that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strain ( Gire et al.\n, 2014 ) .\nHence , for the 2014 Ebola outbreak to have begun in a lab , the Makona strain must either represent the escape of an unpublished strain , perhaps one collected during fieldwork in central Africa .\nAlternatively , Makona could be a radically manipulated derivative of a known strain\u2013either through genetic engineering or passaging .\nA combination of these two possibilities should also be considered .\nOf these two alternatives , we know that Ebola and other viruses were being sought from wild animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as part of USAID \u2019 s PREDICT project .\nThe chief actors in this were the Wildlife Conservation Society ( WCS ) and Metabiota , which , at the time , was at the time a partner of the VHFC .\nResearchers from these two organisations searched the Congo basin and collected large numbers of blood samples , faecal samples and other genetic material from likely wild animal sources of Ebola : bats , animals captured for bushmeat , and apes ( Olson et al.\n, 2012 ; Reed et al.\n, 2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kumakamba et al.\n, 2021 ) .\nOther samples were obtained from human patients from the Congo ( Grard et al.\n, 2012 ) .\nSome of this prospecting activity overlaps in time with the outbreak in West Africa .\nThus , one possibility is that Metabiota , or other collectors , used the VHFC lab at Kenema as part of a cold chain for the preservation of samples brought from the Congo basin .\nThis might have been necessary since the Congo basin has historically been a politically unstable region and less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lab may also have been used for initial screening or testing of such samples .\nA third possibility is the formal or informal sharing of samples or strains with VHFC contacts or colleagues at Kenema , perhaps to help in the development of commercial treatments or diagnostic tools .\nThe kinds of samples that could have carried Ebola from the Congo basin include wildlife blood and tissue samples , samples from humans with suspected illnesses , and even whole animals or patients themselves .\nThe possibility that the Kenema site was used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other countries is especially intriguing in light of the statement that Matt Boisen made to Reuters : \u201c we do have the ability to do a lot more in the same amount of time.\n\u201d Given these potentialities it is remarkable to discover that , in July 2014 , during the epidemic , the VHFC wrote a brief report in which they accused Metabiota of an activity that would be riskier still .\nThe VHFC accused Metabiota staff at Kenema of culturing cells from Ebola patients , which they insisted was dangerous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued a qualified denial , but the allegation is highly credible since the two organisations shared the same site ; moreover its implications are very great .\nIt suggests , first , that Metabiota had an interest in culturing novel strains of Ebola , second , that they had the technical capability and the personnel competent to do so at Kenema , and third , that they were willing to take exceptional risks .\nAs the VHFC states , culturing Ebola in a small , uncertified , and unsecure lab would be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problematic biosafety step in virus research since it is an amplification process .\nThe allegation therefore raises , in a very concrete way , the question of what Metabiota might have been doing in Kenema prior to the outbreak .\nWe know too , from the history of lab acquired infections of Ebola and Ebola-like viruses , that spillovers to humans do not require cultivation of the virus and can result from research accidents with live or deceased animals , with isolated tissues , or through the manipulation of patient samples ( Luby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al.\n, 1977 ; Formenty et al.\n, 1999 ; Anonymous , 2004 ) .\nAlso important to note is that , in some of these cases , Ebola was not known to be present in the sample when the accident occurred .\nThus , given the research interests and the capacities of the VHFC lab in Kenema and its collaborators , it is a relatively simple matter to theorise how a novel strain of Ebola , like Makona , might have reached Kenema and then spilled over there during routine research activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Metabiota .\nBesides collecting samples from the wild , Metabiota was also the company that , at least according to MSF and the WHO , obstructed or mishandled testing and diagnosis at Kenema and that Sylvia Blyden alleged \u201c messed up the whole region.\n\u201d If a research error on the part of Metabiota was the source of the strain ( and Metabiota \u2019 s incompetence has been widely alleged ) , or even suspected to be , they would have had a strong incentive to also \u2018 bungle \u2019 the identification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origin .\nIt is also possible that the government of Sierra Leone suspected that Ebola came from the Kenema lab .\nOn July 23 , 2014 , in the midst of the Ebola outbreak , its Ministry of Health and Sanitation used its Facebook page ( now deleted ) to set out a series of orders .\nThese were widely reported in the Sierra Leone media and were to \u201c be effectual immediately \u201d .\nOne injunction was for \u201c Tulane University \u201d ( Robert Garry \u2019 s home institution ) and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new patients .\n\u201c Tulane \u201d was also instructed to leave the Kenema lab .\nPart four instructed the Kenema lab \u201c to stop Ebola testing during the current Ebola outbreak.\n\u201d This last instruction is especially intriguing .\nLiterally , it implies the lab was conducting research on the virus .\nHowever , the wording is ambiguous ; quite possibly , given the circumstances , the lab was only being instructed to cease testing for Ebola .\nEither way , amidst a catastrophic epidemic it is a seemingly counterproductive but striking step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing and treatment site .\nFurthermore , just two weeks later , on Aug. 7 , 2014 , again in the midst of the outbreak , the U.S. government announced a similar decision .\nIt cut funding to Tulane and the VHFC .\nAs related by Reuters : \u201c The National Institutes of Health rejected a proposal from New Orleans-based Tulane University to renew the five-year contract which expires in November , according to a July 30 letter from NIH reviewed by Reuters .\nThe expiring contract is worth $ 15 million.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision , \u201d citing \u201c federal government procurement integrity rules.\n\u201d The Consortium was nevertheless able to secure other sources of funding .\nAt the end of 2014 , Corgenix received an infusion of over $ 800,000 from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation that it split with its partners .\nOn October 17 , 2014 , President Barack Obama named Ron Klain \u201c Ebola czar \u201d .\nKlain is now chief of staff in the Biden administration .\nThe same day , the Obama White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any new studies that include certain gain-of-function experiments involving influenza , SARS , and MERS viruses.\n\u201d The official statement connected the decision to recent biosafety incidents at Federal research facilities which had received a measure of media coverage .\nThe New York Times reported on the move , noting that the pause : \u201c made no mention of Ebola or any related filovirus.\n\u201d However , the timing of the announcement is suggestive that the research pause and the Ebola outbreak were connected .\nDid researchers fix the phylogenetic analysis to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ebola outbreak ?\nBecause so many Ebola genomes were sequenced during the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak , a succession of major scientific papers appeared that analysed the epidemic in great detail from a phylogenetic perspective ( Dudas and Rambaut , 2014 ; Baize et al.\n, 2014 ; Gire et al.\n, 2014 ; Carroll et al.\n, 2015 ; Hoenen et al.\n, 2015 ; Ladner et al.\n, 2015 ; Park et al.\n, 2015 ; Simon-Lori\u00e9re et al.\n, 2015 ; Quick et al.\n, 2016 ; Tong et al.\n, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Holmes et al.\n, 2016 ; Dudas et al.\n, 2017 ) .\nMany of these paid especial attention to the beginning of outbreak and to establishing the identity of the root virus and its geographic location .\nAll of them placed the outbreak origin unambiguously in Guinea .\nNone of them seems to have considered how placing the root there generates the questions and anomalies discussed above .\nA partial explanation for this conviction that the epidemic began in Guinea is that , in an outbreak situation , there are two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a root virus ( Lyons-Weiler et al.\n, 1998 ) .\nBoth methods begin by constructing an unrooted phylogenetic tree ( which simply demonstrates the relatedness of all the viruses in the data set without assigning a root virus ) .\nTo choose a root virus , one employs a genetic out-group in the form of one ( or more than one ) slightly more distantly related genome ( s ) on the theory that the root virus in an outbreak will be the one most closely related to the out-group ( s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this method .\nThe second method uses the timing of samples to infer the root virus .\nThe reasoning is that the root virus will be ( or be closely related to ) the earliest viruses sampled ( Drummond et al.\n, 2006 ) .\nThe latter method , since it relies on sample dating , has a major potential flaw : a susceptibility to sampling biases .\nSupposing the epidemic started in Sierra Leone but samples were taken there only long after sampling had begun in Guinea .\nIn that case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would wrongly place the root virus in Guinea .\nThis flaw is well known to phylogenetic experts ( Liu et al.\n, 2020 ; Kumar et al.\n, 2021 ) .\nAs Kumar et al .\nstated it : \u201c Some methods also incorporate sampling times in phylogenetic inference , but they will automatically favor placing the earliest sampled genomes at or near the root of the tree .\nThis fact introduces circularity in testing the hypothesis that the earliest sampled genomes were ancestral because sampling time is used in the inference procedure.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) that sampling preferentially began in one location only , in this case because MSF was initially invited only to Guinea or because Metabiota and Tulane bungled their response ( as was widely alleged ) , then relying on sample dating to infer the root of the 2014 outbreak amounts to circular reasoning .\nEvery one of the 13 phylogeny papers listed above , however , used sample dating to locate the root virus .\nOnly four of them also used an out-group method .\nOf these four , three did not explicitly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooting confirmed the dating result ( Gire et al.\n, 2014 ; Dudas and Rambaut , 2014 ; Holmes et al.\n, 2016 ) .\nFor the fourth , this test was premature since only three genome sequences ( all from Guinea ) were available then ( Baize et al.\n, 2014 ) .\nIn other words , even though many of these papers were published in the foremost scientific journals , like Science ( Gire et al.\n, 2014 ; Hoenen et al.\n, 2015 ) , Nature ( Carroll et al.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2015 ; Quick et al.\n, 2016 ; Tong et al.\n, 2016 ; Holmes et al.\n, 2016 ; Dudas et al.\n, 2017 ) and Cell ( Park et al.\n, 2015 ) , their conclusions , that the epidemic began in Guinea are unsound due to this circularity and failure to make use of an out-group .\nThe circularity of relying on timing alone was surely known to the senior authors ( and presumably to peer-reviewers also ) .\nMany of these authors must also have been aware of MSF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhy then was the obvious step of testing the Guinea root with an out-group skipped in all these papers ?\nWas it because doing so would contradict a Guinean origin ?\nWe are not in a position to remedy that omission .\nHowever , what we can say is that not corroborating the clearly flawed clock method with the obvious test is a very puzzling and troubling omission\u2013all the more so since placing the origin in Guinea generates clear genetic and epidemiological anomalies .\nOur conclusion , just from the phylogeny of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much like the epidemiological studies on Emile and Meliandou , the certainty with which researchers have placed the origin in Guinea is unwarranted .\nMuch more likely , the true site of emergence was in Sierra Leone .\nThe totality of the phylogenetic evidence , supporting Sierra Leone as the source , must be considered alongside all the other evidence relevant to the origin .\nAs noted above , despite much searching , there is so far no evidence for an animal reservoir for Zaire Ebola in West Africa ( Goldstein et al.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s sudden appearance in the region was thus unexpected and is still unexplained .\nFurthermore , the epidemiological investigations in Guinea and Sierra Leone were inconclusive and unconvincing .\nThere was , however , a single spillover event , which is also consistent with a lab origin .\nAnd last , there was a research laboratory nearby that specialised in viral haemorrhagic fevers .\nThe VHFC lab may or may not have housed Ebola viruses but it certainly had a dubious biosafety record .\nAll of the evidence , including the phylogeny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origin .\nIt is hence exceedingly difficult to understand why the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak has repeatedly been cited as a clear-cut example of a zoonotic outbreak .\nHence , like Chernoh Bah before us , the unacknowledged extreme contrast between the standard account and the evidence base compelled us to consider whether there was not , at some level , a concerted scientific effort to deflect attention from the VHFC and its lab in Kenema .\nSome observations about the authors of these phylogenetic papers on the origin of the 2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too ) seem pertinent .\nThe first point is the pattern of substantial overlapping authorship amongst the papers that studied the epidemic and especially among the phylogenetic analyses that placed the origin in Guinea .\nSome of these overlaps are highlighted in Table 1 .\nOne or more of just six researchers are represented on all of them : Robert Garry , Andrew Rambaut , Stephan Gunther , Kristian Andersen , Pardis Sabeti , and Edward Holmes are lead authors on almost all of these publications .\nOf the two exceptions , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ et al.\n, 2015 ) .\nThe second is from China \u2019 s CDC ( Tong et al.\n, 2015 ) .\n( However , a senior author of this paper is George Gao , China \u2019 s CDC recently departed head and a long-time associate of Rambaut and Holmes ) .\nSecond , many of the authors are now very prominent figures in the scientific disciplines of evolutionary virology and epidemiology ( Andrew Rambaut , Robert Garry , George Gao , Edward Holmes , Gytis Dudas , Kristian Andersen , Wu-Chun Cao @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pierre Formenty , Trevor Bedford , Jonathan Towner , Gustavo Palacios , Stuart Nichol ) .\nOne of them is celebrated geneticist Eric Lander , who , until he was forced to resign in February , 2022 , was President Biden \u2019 s chief science advisor and is the founding director of the prestigious Broad Institute , whose Sabeti lab is a partner of the VHFC .\n( Gire et al.\n, 2014 ) .\nThird , most of the senior authors of the phylogeny papers ( notably , Robert Garry , Kristian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saphire , Daniel Park , and Stephen Gire ) and plenty of less well-known authors , are directly connected to the VHFC and its Kenema lab .\nThese authors in particular , have a career-sized conflict of interest , which they may also think is dwarfed by the possibility of being implicated in 11,000 deaths .\nLastly , in the face of widespread suspicions of a lab origin for SARS-CoV-2 , many of these same authors ( Robert Garry , Andrew Rambaut , Kristian Andersen , Edward Holmes , and Stuart Nichol ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ardent defenders of a zoonotic origin for COVID-19 .\nHow this overlap came about would seem a key question for both the Ebola and SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks .\nAs was learned from Freedom of Information Act requests , early in the COVID-19 pandemic , Anthony Fauci , head of the NIAID , secretly enlisted a small group of virologists to confer with ( see p3134 of these emails ) about whether SARS-CoV-2 originated from a lab .\nAs evidence pointing to a lab origin for COVID-19 accumulated , this group evolved into what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origin SWAT team .\nNot only were its members principals in arguing against lab origin theories , they even adopted many of the same scientific and phylogenetic misdirection strategies and tactics as those described above to suppress COVID-19 lab origin speculation .\nFauci \u2019 s initial discussion group included Drs Garry , Rambaut , Andersen , and Holmes , but what expertise did they bring to the table ?\nRambaut and Holmes had contributed to a handful of publications on the evolution of coronaviruses .\nOn the other hand , Garry and Andersen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Google Scholar , had never authored a single paper on coronaviruses before joining the group .\nIs it possible , therefore , that when COVID-19 broke out in Wuhan , the consideration uppermost in the mind of Anthony Fauci when he chose his secret circle was not scientific expertise but instead to find researchers familiar with the scientific and political challenges posed by a potential lab outbreak ?\nThis link between Ebola 2014 and COVID-19 raises a closing question : to what extent is the COVID-19 outbreak , with its likely lab origin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the price to be paid for not conducting open , thorough , and forensic investigations of virus outbreaks , and instead leaving those tasks to the mercy of the researchers with the most vested interests ?\nFurthermore , it is difficult not to notice that the funding regime for pathogen research has spectacularly rewarded the researchers most involved in the Ebola 2014 outbreak .\nThough the VHFC and/or its then partner Metabiota are strong candidates to have initiated the whole event , and although they are also widely believed to have \u201c messed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the initial response , the VHFC has profited greatly from the catastrophe .\nNot only did its personnel get to publish numerous papers in prestigious journals and so considerably enhance their careers , the VHFC now has a clinic three times the size of the old one .\nIn 2016 , the US Navy built a brand new clinic at Kenema with state of the art research , biosafety , water supply , and decontamination systems , including an entirely new building to serve as a \u2018 biorepository \u2019 ( Goba et al.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ are forms of injustice .\nLike all injustice , they flourish in the dark .\nTo serve justice , as well as to help prevent future outbreaks , the people of West Africa deserve to have the most intense light possible shed on the question of why Ebola came to them in 2014 .\nSam Husseini is an independent journalist .\nJonathan Latham , PhD , is a virologist .\nReferences Andersen , K.
