among Democrats over rising crime", "date": "2022-01-04", "source": "coloradopeakpolitics", "title": "Liberal Denver Post columnist ignites civil war among Democrats over rising crime", "content": "Liberal Denver Post columnist Ian Silverii kicked off the new year by igniting a civil war on the left over rising crime .\nSilverii \u2019 s column attempted to downplay the soaring crime rate in Colorado by ostensibly attacking the Common Sense Institute think tank .\nThe group published a report in December which argued among other things that Colorado \u2019 s troubling crime trajectory might \u2014 gasp \u2014 be influenced by liberal policies that keep criminals out of jail .\nYet according to Silverii , liberal politicians keeping repeat offenders out of jail can \u2019 t be responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost everywhere in Colorado .\nNever mind the fact Democrats have , rhetorically , at least , occupied the governor \u2019 s mansion for the last 15 years and passed a number of bills over that timeframe that have made it easier for criminals to walk free everywhere .\nBut in Silverii \u2019 s Chesa Boudin worldview , crime is just a symptom of society \u2019 s choices .\nIn a sense we \u2019 ll give him partial credit : electing soft on crime Democrats and driving cops out of their jobs is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s drive-by insults and superficial arguments about the real cause of rising crime , he clearly had another target in his crosshairs : former Hickenlooper Chief of Staff Doug Friednash .\nFriednash , a partner at the law firm Brownstein Hyatt , published his own opinion piece in November imploring Democrats to take crime more seriously in the wake of Glenn Youngkin \u2019 s surprise upset in the Virginia gubernatorial race .\nMany police departments across the country need more resources to address staffing shortages , improve training and make important community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate bail and bond policies and yes , properly punishing violent criminals and repeat offenders too\u2026even if that means we have to put more people behind bars and for longer periods of time .\nDemocrats who ignore this issue , do so at their own political peril .\nIn response , Silverii took direct aim at Friednash in every way but name .\nOne worldview suggests that there are very bad , evil people out there , and we need to catch them and lock them up and throw away the key .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ we \u2019 ll have rid society of all of the bad apples and voila , no more crime .\nAnother worldview , that I generally refer to as reality , says that crime is largely a symptom of society \u2019 s choices , and a lagging indicator of the consequences of a longtime lack of investment in health care , education , and economic opportunity for those without privilege .\nThe juxtaposition between Friednash \u2019 s rather sober , common sense advice and Silverii \u2019 s shrill diatribe is difficult to overstate .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ respective solutions to rising crime are also irreconcilable so long as Democrats like Silverii refuse to consider any reforms that address Colorado \u2019 s glaring shortage of law enforcement and lax sentencing laws .\nThat \u2019 s a big problem considering 2022 is increasingly seen by voters as a referendum over rising crime nationally .\nThe last thing Democrats need going into the midterms is a figurative civil war over how to address crime , but thanks to Silverii that \u2019 s exactly what \u2019 s playing out right now in Colorado .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil war \u201d we mean a figurative political dispute , not an actual war that would inevitably result from the \u201c national divorce \u201d floated by a few renowned intellectual luminaries .", "author":

difficult in rural communities where families have further to drive and less access to goods and services ( under Democrat rule ) .\nJust this year , housing prices have increased 20 percent , a record high , and are expected to continue rising ( under Democrat rule ) .\nThe cost to fill up your car , up 7 percent , to heat your home up 112 percent and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under Democrat rule ) .\nAnother essential for Colorado families , food , has increased in price at a faster rate this past year than it did during the last decade , nearly an additional $ 200 a month for the average family ( under Democrat rule ) .\nGoods across the country have increased in price at the fastest rate in over 30 years , creating real hardship for people everywhere ( under Democrat rule ) .\nIt costs them significantly more to feed their family every day , to drive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their homes .\nBut , we have failed to truly make it better ( under Democrat rule ) .\nInstead , most of the last legislative session was spent passing bills that increased taxes and fees and made life more expensive for the very people we are trying to help ( under Democrat rule ) .\nFamilies have long memories of hard times , most of our parents remember the toughness of the Depression , many of us remember the inflation of the 1970 \u2019 s and the race between the money and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run out first ( under Democrat rule ) .\nBut good times often make us forget and we have had a few years of a good economy and opportunities with jobs and housing .\nWhat we will not forget is the legislation that was passed just last year that went around the Taxpayer \u2019 s Bill of Rights by swapping the word \u201c tax \u201d for \u201c fee \u201d ( under Democrat rule ) .\nWe all know it is a gas tax , the Governor said so more than once this week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election , he has decided to delay the very fees that he told us were critical to pass , saying that delay is saving people money even though the fee is just another tax ( under Democrat rule ) .\nSo instead of playing tricksy with words , let \u2019 s actually make things more affordable here in Colorado by eliminating excessive taxes and fees ( under Democrat rule ) .\nIf families are not sitting around the table worrying about how to make ends meet , they are worried about the safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under Democrat rule )

last year should not come as a surprise .\nIn fact , Republicans in this very chamber fought for hours on end in committee rooms here in this building against the legislation that helped create the problems we see today ( under Democrat rule ) .\nAs a result , Coloradans have had to deal with a 6.5 percent increase in violent crimes , the highest levels in 25 years .\nThat included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assaults ( under Democrat rule ) .\nAdditionally , we lead the country in the rate of auto theft .\nOver the last ten years Colorado \u2019 s rate has increased by 135 percent while the national rate was only 3 percent , and we have seen the largest increase in property crimes of any state ( under Democrat rule ) .\nThis needs to stop ( under Democrat rule ) .\nThat \u2019 s about where we passed

40 billion with a B on this year \u2019 s budget with your tax dollars .\nMeanwhile , House and Senate Republicans introduced their Commitment to Colorado package of 44 bills , linked on this page where voters can track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nRepublicans will push for legislation to exempt sales tax on prepared and fresh food , tax breaks for rent , tax exemptions for seniors and veterans , and a

\u2022 Degrade the accuracy of voter registration lists by severely restricting the ability of states to verify the eligibility and qualifications of voters and removing ineligible voters ; \u2022 Require states to allow online voter registration not tied to an existing state record on an individual , such as a driver \u2019 s license , which would open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraud by cyber criminals ; \u2022 Require states to automatically register individuals to vote from state and federal databases , such as state Departments of Motor Vehicles , which would result in the registration of ineligible voters , including aliens , and cause multiple registrations of the same individuals ( the sponsors know this , which is why they \u2019 ve put in an immunity-from-prosecution provision for aliens who get registered ) ; \u2022 Give unaccountable and unelected bureaucrats at the U.S. Department of Justice veto authority over most election changes made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereignty that violates federalism and overrides the decisions of the voters and their elected state representatives to determine the election rules for their state ;

program under Biden .\nWhen Biden came into office last year , he paused oil and gas leasing on federal lands and last fall published a report criticizing the program as antiquated and deferential to

PeakNation\u2122 for the most shocking political scandal of all time : Campana held a graduation party for his daughter back in 2013 , they played music , and it was noisy .\nIt was so noisy , a neighbor called the cops .\nAnd when Campana eventually identified himself as a city councilman , numerous squad cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lieutenant responded to the noisy graduation party where music was playing .\nCampana \u2019 s campaign fell hard on their sword , and admits he celebrated his daughter \u2019 s graduation .\nBut before we get too far into the details of what the police report said , it \u2019 s worth noting how Nicholas Riccardi with the Associated Press portrayed what happened that fateful night .\nTurns out he did argue when officers told him to shut down the party and

do it smart and that he wanted to make sure that no one had alcohol in their system and was going to drive.\n\u201d Police told him they did not have the resources to make sure everyone was sober .\nSeriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they cared they might be sending drunk drivers onto the streets .\nAs the report goes on , it \u2019 s clear Campana is not going to tell all the guests to leave , he \u2019 s clearly concerned that some would be driving intoxicated , and didn \u2019 t want anyone hurt .\nHe protested whether he was in violation of the city \u2019 s noise ordinance , which as a councilman he should know what that was , and yes , he grew impatient .\nThe music had already stopped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his guests to leave .\nThe report says : \u201c Mr .\nCampana then told us that it was his house , and that he would just have all of the people spend the night here , and that officers could not dictate who stayed or who had left .\nOfficer Wagner had told Mr. Campana that this was true , but that having the party shut down would gauge Mr. Campana \u2019 s cooperation.\n\u201d In the end , Campana was served with a noise violation .\nCampana had a party nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud , he argued with police and refused to unleash drunk drivers on the highways .\nIt \u2019 s not like he was accused of assaulting his secretary and shoving her into a filing cabinet , then running for

conversation Peak reported previously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could face felony charges for lying about his address to establish residency in his El Paso County Senate District .\nThis previously unreported audio from Lee shows Democrats already worried about backlash over public safety before their police accountability law had even gone into effect .\nThe audio comes from a conversation with

.\n\u201c There are varying reasons , but numerous exit interviews suggest that public perception and risks of civil litigation are among the top concerns , \u201d El Paso County Sheriff Bill Elder said in the study .\nColorado Springs Mayor John Suthers suggested the police \u201c backed off \u201d after Floyd \u2019 s death and SB-217 , leading to a drop in arrests : Mayor John Suthers said he believes the police backed off after Floyd \u2019 s death here and around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is getting back to an appropriate level of policing .\nArrests should be rising as the population grows , he

continued their streak of offender-friendly activism in the legislature .\nAfter passing SB-217 , Democrats also effectively decriminalized fentanyl possession along with a host of other drugs with another law that went into effect in 2020 .\nSince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths have climbed at a \u201c faster rate in Colorado than most other states.\n\u201d During the current legislative session , Lee adamantly opposed efforts to increase penalties for fentanyl possession and supported amendments that would make it extremely difficult for law enforcement to convict anyone of felony possession

word ) progressive left and the moderate old world Democrat Party in the new session .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of politics , Ortiz further lectured the reporter should have used her time to solve the problems of state legislators , and prompted more criticism from other local Colorado media folks including the reporter \u2019 s editor .\nWe look forward to more reporting by Colorado Politics on the \u201c
