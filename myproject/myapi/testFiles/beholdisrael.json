in the ancient Persian Empire .\nPurim is celebrated on the 14th day of Adar by Jewish communities .\nIt includes festivities , parties , costumes , and the reading of the Book of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in the Book of Esther , where a plot by Haman , the royal advisor to King Ahasuerus , was conceived to kill the Jews in the Persian Empire .\nThree years into King Ahasuerus \u2019 reign , he made a feast for officials , servants , nobles , and princes lasting 180 days .\nWhen that feast was over , the king gave a banquet for all the people in Shushan .\nOn the seventh day of that banquet , King Ahasuerus asked his wife , Queen Vashti , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her beauty .\nQueen Vashti refused his request , angering the king , which led to her banishment .\nFollowing Queen Vashti \u2019 s removal , King Ahasuerus sought a new wife , ordering a beauty pageant in which he would choose a new bride .\nA law was decreed that all of the beautiful , single women of the land would be brought to King Ahasuerus so he could pick a new queen .\nOne of the women presented to the king was Esther , an orphaned girl raised by her cousin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMordecai was a Shushanite resident and leader of the Jewish people .\nHe asked Esther to keep her Jewish identity a secret for her own safety .\nEsther was forced to join King Ahasuerus \u2019 s harem to participate in the contest of becoming the king \u2019 s new wife .\nFor twelve months , the women were pampered in perfumes , oils , and lotions in preparation for the king \u2019 s choosing .\nDuring the selection , King

.\nThe men were hanged after Mordecai informed the king of their plan .\nOne of the king \u2019 s ministers , Haman , was then promoted in rank .\nHaman was an anti-Semite , a descendant of the nation of Amalek .\nShortly after his promotion , King Ahasuerus issued a decree that all must bow to Haman , but Mordecai refused to bow to Haman .\nHaman went before the king , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for permission to exterminate all the Jews of the land .\nThe king refused to take the money and told Haman , \u201c The nation is yours to do with as you please , \u201d opening the floodgates for the persecution of the Jewish people .\nThis marked the 13th of the month of Adar .\nHaman sent proclamations throughout the kingdom signed with the royal crest calling on the people of the empire to oppose the Jews .\nUpon hearing of the decree , Mordecai called Esther to go to the king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people .\nMordecai told Esther : Esther would agree to do as Mordecai requested and called on the Jew of the land to fast for three days , which all of them ( approximately 22,000 ) agreed to do .\nFollowing the three days of prayer and fasting , Esther approached the king .\nThe king accepted her , and Esther invited Haman and the king to a feast she would prepare , and they accepted .\nThe king asked Esther if she had a request for him , and Esther stated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe king accepted her invitation .\nDuring the feast , Mordecai refused to bow to Haman , leading to a plot by Haman to have him hanged .\nThe same night before the second feast , King Ahasuerus could not sleep and called on his servants to read from the royal chronicles .\nThe servants read to him about Mordecai saving the king \u2019 s life .\nThe king called on Haman , asking him what a man should be rewarded for saving a king .\nHaman responded that the man should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse , and be proclaimed throughout the city streets as the man who the king delights to honor\u2026 \u2026King Ahasuerus ordered Haman to do this for \u201c Mordecai the Jew.\n\u201d The second feast arrived , and King Ahasuerus asked Esther what her request was .\nEsther revealed she was a Jew and exposed Haman for the evil

themselves and pre-emptively kill anyone who put them at risk .\nOn the 13th of Adar , the Jews battled those who tried to kill them , including Haman \u2019 s ten sons who died in Shushan

commentary on Pentecost as Jews worldwide begin observing Shavuot ( The Feast of Weeks ) on Saturday evening .\nJews worldwide will begin observing the Feast of Weeks ( Shavuot ) on Saturday evening , leading into Pentecost on Sunday .\nPentecost means fifty , as it is exactly fifty days after the Feast of First Fruits .\nCommon forms of celebration include musical events and activities as a family .\nAdditionally , markets and bakeries will typically overflow with produce as a sign of the celebration of the harvest of the land .\nThe holiday is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biblical seven-week wheat harvest in the Land of Israel , and it commemorates God \u2019 s gift of the Torah and His oath to the Jewish people at Mount Sinai .\nFurthermore , on this day nearly 2,000 years ago , the Holy Spirit ( the promise of the Father ) descended and marked the birth of the church ( \u0395\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 ) .\nActs 2:1-4 When the Day of Pentecost had fully come , they were all with one accord in one place .\nAnd suddenly there came a sound from heaven , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it filled the whole house where they were sitting .\nThen there appeared to them divided tongues , as of fire , and one sat upon each of them .\nAnd they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues , as the Spirit gave them utterance .\nThese festivals are all just the shadow of things to come .\nThe substance is Jesus Christ !\nMay our eyes and heart remember to learn from the shadow , but focus on the substance .\nIn Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jews and Gentiles alike .\nIn Him , we are ONE !\n1 Peter 2:9-10 But you are a chosen generation , a royal priesthood , a holy nation , His own special people , that you may proclaim the praises of Him who called you out of darkness

will mark the beginning of the observance of Tisha B \u2019 Av , or , the Ninth of Av .\nTisha B \u2019 Av is recognized as one of the saddest days on the Hebrew calendar , as it commemorates the destruction of the first two temples in Jewish history , not to mention several other tragic events .\nAs Jews observe this day of mourning , they will traditionally fast ( water and food ) , emphasize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mourn in various ways .\nThey will also refrain from any marital , physical intimacy , routine hobbies , and bathing , among other things .\nAlso commemorated on this date is the Bar Kochba Revolt in 133 A.D. , when the Jews fell to the Romans , followed by the plowing of the Temple Mount exactly one year later .\nAdditionally , the expulsion of England \u2019 s Jews in 1290 and the banishment of all Jews from Spain in 1492 fell on this very day in history .\nInterestingly enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same calendar date in history , the ninth of Av , 657 years apart .\nThe first temple , the Solomonic temple ( built by King Solomon , David \u2019 s son ) , was destroyed by the Babylonians in 587 B.C .\nafter the Jews had been exiled to Babylon under King Nebuchadnezzar II .\nThe second temple , the Herodian temple , was destroyed in 70 A.D. at the hands of the Romans when they sieged Jerusalem \u2013 an event that Jesus Himself foretold ( Matthew 24:1-2 ) .\nThe reasoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sadly , was due to the nation \u2019 s sin , which resulted in exile from the land for 70 years ( Jeremiah 29:10 , Daniel 9:2 ) .\nAs previously mentioned , the second temple was destroyed when the Romans sieged Jerusalem , ultimately leading to the diaspora of the Jewish people which was foretold by the prophets .\nWhile the past temples are of great significance both biblically and historically , the series of temples has not run its course .\nIf you ever go on a trip to Israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City , you can find your way to the Temple Institute .\nWithin this institute , it will become abundantly clear that the Jewish people are beyond ready to construct their third temple .\nThey have the blueprints , priestly garments , temple utensils ( with the exception of the original Ark of the Covenant ) , etc .\nSo , what \u2019 s preventing them ?\nThe Temple Mount is one of the most religiously controversial places on the face of the earth , currently manned by Islam \u2019 s Dome of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third-holiest site of Islam .\nHowever , a time is coming when a man who the Bible refers to as the man of sin , the man of lawlessness , is going to likely provide the means for Israel to construct its third temple , despite the pressure from Islam .\nThat being said , tragically , according to Daniel , Jesus , and Paul , this temple , the third temple , also faces a rough future ( Daniel 9:27 , Matthew 24:15 , 2 Thessalonians 2:4 ) .\nThis temple will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ever live , the Antichrist , and will lead to the worst persecution the Jewish people have ever experienced .\nThankfully , despite the tragedies surrounding the third temple , this isn \u2019 t where the series ends .\nThere will be a fourth temple , and our Messiah , Jesus , will reign from it Himself ( Ezekiel 43:1-7 ) , bringing to the world something it has never experienced but God has always intended \u2013 perfect peace , perfect justice , perfect righteousness ; a perfect King .\nMake sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Next Temple , for further learning !", "author": "Behold Israel", "url":

trumpets for yourself ; you shall make them of hammered work ; you shall use them for calling the congregation and for directing the movement of the camps .\nWhen they blow both of them , all the congregation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tabernacle of meeting .\nBut if they blow only one , then the leaders , the heads of the divisions of Israel , shall gather to you .\n5When you sound the advance ,

sound the call for them to begin their journeys .\nAnd when the assembly is to be gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sound the advance .\nThe sons of Aaron , the priests , shall blow the trumpets ; and these shall be to you as an ordinance forever throughout your generations.\n\u201d ( Numbers 10:1-8 ) Since 1948 , for the first time in modern history , the nation of Israel and the Church exist at the same time .\nI believe that God is using both of them as the two silver trumpets , calling for the attention of the world and preparing those that are willing to repent to get ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Land

.\nIt is very brief but immensely longed for .\nIt \u2019 s the Rapture .\nIndeed , the trumpets are sounding !\nDo you hear them ?\nFor the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout , with the voice of an archangel , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead in Christ will rise first .\nThen we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air

"content": "Amir \u2019 s commentary on Yom Kippur as Jews begin the observance of this sacred day on Tuesday evening .\nOver the next few days Jews all over the world will ask one another , \u201c Did you fast on Yom Kippur ?\n\u201d If there is any day that deserves a fast , it is the Day of Atonement .\nIt is a day of repentance and purification , of contemplation and sorrow .\nHow strange it is , then , that the most common blessing one Jew will bestow upon another during this time is \u201c Have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201c Make a sacrifice of contrition and remorse to the Lord , and may it cost you as little as possible.\n\u201d That \u2019 s sort of missing the point .\nBut the \u201c point-missing \u201d is even bigger than that , because the tradition of fasting on Yom Kippur is not even biblical .\nThe rabbis through the years have justified the fast using the words of Leviticus 23:27 : \u201c \u2026it shall be a holy convocation for you ; you shall afflict your souls , and offer an offering made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fasting in that verse ?\nThe rabbis will say that it is there plain as day in the words , \u201c you shall afflict your souls.\n\u201d Now I may get a little uncomfortable when I don \u2019 t eat for a time .\nI may even get a little hangry \u2013 that grumpy state where hunger and anger meet .\nBut that is afflicting my body , not my soul .\nDon \u2019 t get me wrong .\nFasting can be a wonderful thing .\nIt can be a time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt can be a period of sacrifice and commitment , showing the Lord that you are ready to give all to Him .\nBut if you are asking yourself just how easy can I make this fast with it still being considered a fast , you \u2019 re probably asking the wrong question .\nThe Jews were told to afflict their souls .\nBut notice that the affliction wasn \u2019 t the only action required .\nIn tandem , they were also told to \u201c offer an offering made by fire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the affliction , they were told to add true worship .\nThis is where the pieces all drop into place .\nThis is not a physical command ; it is spiritual .\nGod is not concerned about people performing the traditions and the rituals ; He wants broken hearts before Him , recognizing their own sin and His merciful provision for forgiveness .\n\u201c Have an easy fast \u201d is a perfect blessing because fasting can be very easy .\nIt \u2019 s often a matter of missing a few meals then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s soul is much more difficult because it involves humility , dependence , and life-change .\nIn other words , it requires repentance \u2013 a confession of one \u2019 s sins before the Lord based on faith in Jesus and the sufficiency of His death on the cross , and a commitment to turn from those sins , removing them from your life never to go back .\nAfflicting one \u2019 s soul recognizes that it is not about me any longer or my easy life or my desire for comfort or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is following through with the words of Paul when he wrote : It is laying all we are on the altar before God and saying , \u201c I am yours.\n\u201d While there will be a day when all Israel will truly afflict their souls in repentance and receive the salvation that comes through a personal relationship with Jesus , that day is still yet to come .\nBut for you , let today be the day of your salvation .\nLet today be the day that you offer yourself to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your forgiveness , and the beginning of an eternity of peace , joy , and the perfect love that comes from our Savior and Lord , Jesus Christ .\nFor the wages of sin is death , but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord .\n( Romans 6:23 ) Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved \u2013 you and your household .\n( Acts 16:31 ) Behold , now is the accepted time ; behold , now is the day of salvation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Behold , the days are coming , says the Lord , when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah\u2014 not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt , My covenant which

of the year beginning Sunday evening .\nImmanuel \u2013 \u201c God with us \u201d .\nThat is a name that we typically think of around Christmas .\nMatthew reminded us of this glorious title when , while speaking of the birth of Jesus , he alluded to the words of God through Isaiah the prophet : Isaiah 7:14 Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign : Behold , the virgin shall conceive and bear a Son , and shall call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy come from knowing that God is near .\nAgain , it is the theme when we as Christians celebrate Jesus coming into this world as the perfect God/man .\nIt is also the theme of the Jews \u2019 celebration of Sukkot , or the Feast of Tabernacles .\nSukkot is an eight-day feast which Jews all over the world will commemorate by building booths , or sukkahs , decorating them with plants and fruits , and maybe even sleeping in them .\nFrom the outside looking in , it is a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason for this celebration , and it comes right from the mouth of God through His servant Moses : Leviticus 23:33-36,40-43 Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying , \u201c Speak to the children of Israel , saying : \u2018 The fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the Feast of Tabernacles for seven days to the Lord .\nOn the first day there shall be a holy convocation .\nYou shall do no customary work on it .\nFor seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you shall have a holy convocation , and you shall offer an offering made by fire to the Lord .\nIt is a sacred assembly , and you shall do no customary work on it\u2026 .\nAnd you shall take for yourselves on the first day the fruit of beautiful trees , branches of palm trees , the boughs of leafy trees , and willows of the brook ; and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God for seven days .\nYou shall keep it as a feast to the Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It shall be a statute forever in your generations .\nYou shall celebrate it in the seventh month .\nYou shall dwell in booths for seven days .\nAll who are native Israelites shall dwell in booths , that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel dwell in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt : I am the Lord your God.\n\u2019 \u201d It is that last verse that helps it all make sense .\nThis is about the Exodus .\nGod wants the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He brought them out of Egypt .\nBut what about this astounding event is He reminding them of ?\nIs it just , as the passage says , that they dwelt in booths ?\n\u201c Hey , guys , remember that time I had you live in temporary shelters for 40 years ?\nYeah , kinda crazy , huh ?\n\u201d No , to get the meaning , we must dig a little deeper .\nLiving in temp housing for eight days was an experiential reminder that for a time the Israelites didn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vineyards .\nThey were homeless , hapless , and helpless .\nWhat they did have was God .\nHe was their one constant , and He was completely sufficient .\nExodus 13:21-22 And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead the way , and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light , so as to go by day and night .\nHe did not take away the pillar of cloud by day or the pillar of fire by night from before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c God with us \u201d .\nThe Feast of Tabernacles or Booths is not ultimately about tabernacles or booths .\nThey are simply the methodology that God had chosen to remind the Jews that He has always been and always will be with them .\nBut that is a principle that is not just for the Jews .\nGod is always with His people \u2013 Jew or Gentile .\nThat is why this seventh and final Feast is the only one that continues long into the future .\nZechariah 14:16-19 And it shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall go up from year to year to worship the King , the Lord of hosts , and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles .\nAnd it shall be that whichever of the families of the earth do not come up to Jerusalem to worship the King , the Lord of hosts , on them there will be no rain .\nIf the family of Egypt will not come up and enter in , they shall have no rain ; they shall receive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations who do not come up to keep the Feast of Tabernacles .\nThis shall be the punishment of Egypt and the punishment of all the nations that do not come up to keep the Feast of Tabernacles .\nTwo facts to notice about this passage .\nFirst , Zechariah is prophesying regarding the Millennium .\nSo , this is a future picture of the Feast of Tabernacles being kept during the thousand year reign of Christ .\nSecond , the ones celebrating will be from \u201c all the nations \u201d \u2013 Jews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people from all over the globe will come to Jerusalem .\nWhy Jerusalem ?\nBecause that is where Jesus the Messiah , the King of Kings and Lord of Lords , will sit on the throne of David and rule His global kingdom .\nAgain , that is God with us , not just in smoke and fire , but in His resurrected body .\nBut that is not all , because there will be a time when the Feast of Tabernacles is fulfilled and there will be no more need for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great voice out of heaven saying , \u201c Behold , the tabernacle of God is with men , and he will dwell with them , and they shall be his people , and God himself shall be with them , and be their God.\n\u201d In the new heaven and new earth , there will be no more need for our tabernacles .\nGod Himself will tabernacle with us for eternity .\nAre you ready for that day ?\nAgain , the tabernacles the Jews built represented their complete dependence upon God for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place where you are completely trusting in God for every part of your life , including your salvation ?\nIf not , let me encourage you to build that tabernacle in your heart today .\nRecognize your need for Him .\nGive yourself to Him by receiving Jesus as your Lord and Savior .\nOpen the door in your life for God to be with you always .", "author": "Behold Israel", "url": "https://beholdisrael.org/the-true-meaning-of-sukkot-the-feast-of-tabernacles-2/", "published": "Fri, 07 Oct 2022 18:05:05

from the Temple treasury to support his military pursuit concerning Egypt .\nAnd in his more severe attempts of Jewish persecution , he stole items like the menorah from the Temple and even placed an idol of Zeus inside .\nHe believed that he himself was Zeus-manifest .\nBut perhaps his most notorious act was when he desecrated the Temple by slaughtering a pig on the altar .\nThe Maccabean Revolt commenced in 167 BC following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish religious practice , which led to a Jewish priest named Mattathias killing a Hellenized Jew who made sacrifices to idols .\nHe also killed the Greek

mentioned above .\nAfter their eventual victory , the Maccabees would make their way into Jerusalem , rededicate the Temple , and install the youngest brother as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s nickname was \u201c Maccabeus , \u201d which is derived from the Hebrew word for \u201c hammer \u201d ( \u05de\u05b7\u05e7\u05b8\u05bc\u05d1\u05b8\u05d4 ) .\nThe book of Daniel undoubtedly makes several mentions of Antiochus IV without mentioning him by name , and it \u2019 s commonly believed that both Antiochus and the Maccabees were in view when the angel Gabriel clued Daniel in on the future : Daniel 11:31-32 And forces shall be mustered by him , and they shall defile the sanctuary fortress ; then they shall take away the daily sacrifices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThose who do wickedly against the covenant he shall corrupt with flattery ; but the people who know their God shall be strong , and carry out great exploits .\nA Jewish tradition at the time was to light Chanukiah ( Hanukkah Menorah ) in the Holy Temple in Jerusalem daily .\nAs tradition tells , when the Maccabees liberated the Holy Temple in Jerusalem , a miracle occurred as only one day \u2019 s worth of oil for lighting the menorah lasted for eight days .\nHence the tradition of eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the holiday , one additional candle is lit commemorating and remembering the strength of the Jewish people and God \u2019 s deliverance from their enemies .\nHanukkah means \u201c dedication \u201d and refers to the rededication and liberation of the Promised People \u2019 s Holy Temple and center of worship to God .\nModern festivities include eating of latkes , potatoes , pancakes , and donuts , as they are cooked in oil .\nYoung children typically light the candles and sing traditional songs , playing with

unity and ceremonies held throughout the nation .\nJohn 10 : 22-23 records , \u201c Then came the Feast of Dedication at Jerusalem .\nIt was winter , and Jesus was in the Temple area walking in Solomon \u2019 s Colonnade.\n\u201d As a Jew , Jesus most certainly would have participated in the Feast of Dedication .\nThe same courageous spirit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intense persecution was passed on to Jesus \u2019 disciples who would all face severe trials because of their faithfulness to Christ .\nAnd like the miracle of God \u2019 s presence expressed through the eternal flame of God burning for the Maccabees , Jesus became the incarnate , physical expression of God \u2019 s presence , the Light of the World who came to dwell among us and give us the eternal light of God \u2019 s life .\nMay we all remember the two most important things from this holiday : Romans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brethren , by the mercies of God , that you present your bodies a living sacrifice , holy , acceptable to God , which is your reasonable service .\nAnd do not be conformed to this world , but be transformed by the renewing of your mind , that you may prove what is that good and acceptable

would ridicule .\nThe Savior of the world had to come to this earth because of people like his relatives .\nWhy ?\nGod wants us to see that through Him , anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and I can be used .\nThrough Him , it does not matter how bad our past is .\nThrough Him , our lives can be changed , although we don \u2019 t deserve it .\nThrough Him , our lives can be eternal .\nIn Genesis 37:26-27 , we find a man by the name of Judah , who proposed that he and his brothers sell Joseph into slavery rather than to kill him .\nJudah leaves home , marries a Canaanite woman , and has three sons , two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are so wicked that God takes their lives .\nAbraham was very careful to obtain a non-Canaanite wife for his son , Isaac ( Chapter 24 ) .\nIsaac and Rebekah were not as careful , but God provided two wives for Jacob from Rebekah \u2019 s brother Laban , in Paddan Aram ( Genesis 29 ) .\nJudah promptly leaves home and marries a Canaanite woman ( Genesis 38:1-2 ) .\nShe has three sons .\nWhen the firstborn son was old enough , Judah acquired a Canaanite wife for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , Er , was evil in God \u2019 s sight , and the Lord took his life ( Genesis 38:7 ) .\nJudah instructed his second son , Onan , to take Tamar and raise a descendant for his deceased brother , but he prevented Tamar from producing a child .\nJudah was afraid of losing his youngest son Shelah , so he asked Tamar to live at home until this boy was older .\nAfter the passing of a considerable period of time , Judah \u2019 s wife died , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to Shelah , his only surviving son .\nShe seems to have known Judah all too well because she disguised herself as a prostitute and stationed herself along the route she knew Judah would be taking to Timnah along with his

\u2013 all items that were as good as fingerprints .\nJudah confessed that Tamar was more righteous than he .\nShe was the one who sought to preserve his line .\nShe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be the one through whom the Messianic line would be continued , no thanks to Judah .\nPretty interesting person that Tamar .\nI have a hard time seeing how she is part of this Royal Family Line .\nLet \u2019 s look at another woman listed in this genealogy .\nRahab is mentioned eight times in Scripture , and in six of these occurrences , her name is found with a specific descriptive noun .\nDo you know what it is ?\nIt is \u201c harlot \u201d ( KJV ) or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This story wonderfully illustrates God \u2019 s grace .\nHe is no respecter of persons .\nHe accepts and forgives us not because of what we

rest in His provision or are looking to know Him better .\nGod had worked in Rahab \u2019 s heart , He knew her faith , her longing to know God and perhaps even to become a part of God \u2019 s people , so God worked and brought the spies and Rahab together for their protection and her blessing .\nGod could have made the spies invisible or smote the people with blindness or used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two men and one woman walking by faith with the courage to act on their convictions , and He chose to use the more normal circumstances of life .\nJoshua 2:2-3 indicates the whole city had been on the alert and the spies were recognized and seen going into the home of Rahab .\nRahab conceals the spies , lies to protect the spies and sends the soldiers of the king on a wild goose chase .\nBecause to do otherwise was an act of treason and punishable by death , the king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t even have her home searched .\nWhy was Rahab saved ?\nBecause she believed in the God of Israel .\nHiding the messengers was an outworking of her faith .\nTo hide the messengers was a calculated deception to protect them , just as many godly people hid Jews in European countries during World War II .\nFirst , what Rahab did was a matter of faith .\nShe had come to believe that the God of Israel was indeed \u201c God in heaven above and earth beneath \u201d ( 2:11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hebrews 11 , the famous Hall of Faith chapter .\nSecond , Rahab \u2019 s faith , which gave her strong convictions about God , caused her to act on her faith to the point of putting her life on the line .\nShe knew eventually Israel would attack the city and destroy it because their God was the true God , and she wanted to be delivered and to become a part of Israel .\nShe did not know a lot about Israel \u2019 s God , His laws of righteousness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she knew He was the supreme God .\nJust before the spies left , they confirmed their agreement with Rahab : First , a scarlet cord hung from the window must identify her house .\nSecond , she and her family were to remain in the house during the attack on the city .\nThird , the spies reassured her that they would be free of their oath , guaranteeing her protection if Rahab exposed their mission .\nSo far , we have found a woman that slept with her father-in-law and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ?\nLet \u2019 s keep looking .\nRuth was a Moabite woman .\nThe Moabites were the race that resulted from the union of Lot and his oldest daughter .\nThe Moabites were forbidden from entering into the assembly of the Lord to the tenth generation ( Deuteronomy 23:3 ) , the Israelites were not commanded to annihilate them , and they were not forbidden to marry them .\nThe Book of Ruth begins with a famine in the land of Israel .\nThis famine prompted Elimelech to leave Israel with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nElimelech seems to have died relatively soon after they came to Moab .\nElimelech and his wife , Naomi , had two sons .\nEach son married a Moabite woman , and eventually , both sons died without having any children .\nNaomi was left with only her two daughters-in-law , Ruth and Orpah .\nShe heard that God had visited His people and that there was once again grain in Israel .\nNaomi purposed to return , but she urged her daughters-in-law to remain in Moab .\nShe managed to persuade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Ruth was determined to remain with Naomi no matter what .\nShe would not be persuaded otherwise , and so Naomi , along with Ruth , returned to Israel .\nWhen they arrived in Naomi \u2019 s hometown of Bethlehem , the people immediately recognized her and were excited that she had returned .\nNaomi was quick to tell them her woes , blaming her troubles on God , who seemed to have it out for her , or so she implied ( Ruth 1:20-22 ) .\nRuth immediately set out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She began to glean in the nearby field of a man who \u201c just happened \u201d to be a near relative of Elimelech ( Ruth 2:3 ) .\nRuth quickly caught the eye of those laboring in the field because she worked diligently , hardly stopping to rest ( Ruth 2:7 ) .\nBoaz noticed her as well and made sure that Ruth was protected and provided with grain to glean as she sought to care for her mother-in-law .\nNaomi realized that Boaz was showing great kindness to Ruth , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to arrange the marriage of Ruth and Boaz .\nNaomi devised a plan whereby Ruth could indicate her need for a husband and her desire to marry Boaz .\nThe plan worked , and Boaz indicated that he would be delighted to marry Ruth , except that he was not the nearest kin .\nBoaz met with the nearest relative in the city gate , allowing him to purchase Elimelech \u2019 s land and to acquire Ruth as a wife .\nThe nearest kin was willing to purchase Elimelech \u2019 s land but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in marriage , and so Boaz acquired both the land and Ruth .\nThey married , and the child Ruth bore to Boaz was named Obed .\nObed was the grandfather of David .\nHere we have a foreigner who somehow gets into the line of Jesus .\nSo , this makes a conniving woman , a prostitute , and a foreigner .\nLet \u2019 s look at the last woman listed in this genealogy .\nIt was evening , and David was just getting out of bed .\nIf we had any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is all gone now .\nAnd it was not to catch up on his paperwork .\nDavid was goofing off !\n\u201c And from the roof he saw a woman bathing , and the woman was very beautiful in appearance \u201d ( 2 Samuel 11:2 ) .\nIf he had used his head , he would have gotten off of that rooftop patio pronto .\nBut he lingered , and let his eyes feast on every inch of Bathsheba \u2019 s fleshly charms until he could think of nothing but having her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either .\nShe may not have purposely enticed David , but she was immodest and indiscreet .\nTo disrobe and bathe in an open courtyard in full view of any number of rooftop patios in the neighborhood was asking for trouble .\nShe could easily have bathed indoors .\nDavid found out who the beautiful bather was , sent for her , and the thought became the deed .\nHer husband was off to war , and she was lonely .\nThe glamour of being desired by the attractive king meant more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her dedication to God .\nThey probably cherished those moments together ; maybe they even assured themselves that it was a tender and beautiful experience .\nMost do !\nBut in God \u2019 s sight , it was hideous and ugly .\nSatan had baited his trap , and they were now in his clutches .\nThe inevitable happened , and Bathsheba sent word to David that she was pregnant .\nThis was a crisis in that culture , for it would have meant death by stoning according to the Law of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nNo crisis had ever shaken David before , and he was certainly not going to let this one destroy him .\nHe planned to bring Bathsheba \u2019 s husband home from the battle for a few days ; then nobody would ever know whose child she was carrying .\nBut Uriah was too patriotic to enjoy his wife while his countrymen were endangering their lives on the battlefield , so he slept in the barracks with the king \u2019 s servants .\nThen David had to put Plan B into operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death warrant , sealed it , and sent it to Captain Joab on the front lines , delivered by Uriah \u2019 s own hand .\nIt ordered Joab to put Uriah in the fiercest part of the battle , and then retreat from him .\nAnd David added murder to his adultery .\nAfter a short period of mourning , Bathsheba entered David \u2019 s house and became his wife .\nThe two lovers finally had each other to enjoy freely and uninterruptedly \u2026 except for one thing : \u201c But the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sight of the Lord \u201d ( 2 Samuel 11:27 ) .\nIt is interesting that in this genealogy , Bathsheba \u2019 s name is not mentioned , but instead , it says , \u201c Whose mother had been Uriah \u2019 s wife.\n\u201d Why the Name of Jesus ?\nMost local Israelis call Jesus \u201c YESHU \u201d \u2013 a name that became a curse .\nIt \u2019 s the acronym of \u201c May His name and memory be erased.\n\u201d Satan has blinded so many from seeing their need and has caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the name of Jesus that now , without having any understanding , Jesus has become a curse .\nYESHUA \u2013 a name that comes from the word \u201c YESHUAH , \u201d means , \u201c Salvation.\n\u201d He is our salvation .\nIn Him , we are saved .\nJOSHUAH is \u201c Jehovah will save , \u201d but YESHUA is salvation .\nThe Journey from Galilee to Judea \u201c Joseph went from Galilee , the city of Nazareth , \u201d which is about an eighty-mile journey from Nazareth to Bethlehem .\nBut that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an air-conditioned car .\nThat \u2019 s at best on a donkey or walking .\nCan you imagine Mary in the advanced stages of pregnancy making that eighty-mile arduous journey from Nazareth to Bethlehem ?\nJust because some punk in Rome wants everybody to be taxed .\nAnd there was no appeal , and they couldn \u2019 t go to the district governor and say , \u201c But she \u2019 s pregnant , she \u2019 s going to have a baby anytime.\n\u201d There was no appeal .\nIf Caesar said it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reigns .\nCaesar rules .\nSo , Joseph went from Nazareth to Bethlehem .\nIsaiah 11 talks about the Branch from the stem of Jesse while Isaiah 60 is Him talking in the first person .\nThese are messianic verses , and the word Branch in Hebrew ( NeZeR ) is the root of the name NazaReth .\nIn other words , though a small and very insignificant place in the eyes of men , Nazareth was destined to be the childhood place of Jesus as it was named after Him .\nJeremiah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being the \u201c Branch of righteousness \u201d coming from the house of David .\nBethlehem is called \u201c the city of David \u201d in the gospels .\nBeing again related to the house of David , we understand why the Messiah had to be born there .\nThe \u201c House of Bread \u201d was the birthplace of the one who testified of Himself as Bread of Life .\nIn Christ \u2019 s day , shepherds stood on the bottom rung of the Israelite social ladder .\nThey shared the same unenviable status as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luke mentions them .\nDuring the time of the Patriarchs , shepherding was a noble occupation .\nShepherds are mentioned early in Genesis 4:20 where Jabal is called the father of those living in tents and raising livestock .\nIn nomadic societies , everyone\u2014whether sheikh or slave\u2014was a shepherd .\nThe wealthy sons of Isaac and Jacob tended flocks ( Genesis 30:29 ; 37:12 ) .\nJethro , the priest of Midian , employed his daughters as shepherdesses ( Exodus 2:16 ) .\nWhen the twelve tribes of Israel migrated to Egypt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe Egyptians were agriculturalists .\nAs farmers , they despised shepherding because sheep and goats meant death to crops .\nBattles between farmers and shepherds are as old as they are fierce .\nThe first murder in history erupted from a farmer \u2019 s resentment of a shepherd ( Genesis 4:1-8 ) .\nEgyptians considered sheep worthless for food and sacrifice .\nEgyptian art forms and historical records portray shepherds negatively .\nNeighboring Arabs\u2014their enemy\u2014were shepherds , and Egyptian hatred climaxed when shepherd kings seized Lower Egypt .\nPharaoh \u2019 s clean-shaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons of Jacob .\nJoseph matter-of-factly informed his brothers , \u201c Every shepherd is detestable to the Egyptians \u201d ( Genesis 46:34 ) .\nIn the course of 400 years , the Egyptians prejudiced the Israelites \u2019 attitude toward shepherding .\nJacob \u2019 s descendants became accustomed to a settled lifestyle and forgot their nomadic roots .\nWhen Israel later settled in Canaan ( 1400 BC ) , the few tribes still retaining a fondness for pastoral life chose to live in the Trans-Jordan ( Numbers 32:1 ) .\nAfter settling in Israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position .\nAs the Israelites acquired more farmland , pasturing decreased .\nShepherding became a menial vocation for the laboring class .\nAround 1000 BC , David \u2019 s emergence as king temporarily raised the shepherd \u2019 s image .\nThe lowliness of this trade made David \u2019 s promotion striking ( 2 Samuel 7:8 ) .\nWhile poetic sections of Scripture record positive allusions to shepherding , scholars believe these references reflect a literary ideal , not reality .\nIn the days of the Prophets , sheepherders symbolized judgment and social desolation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his high calling as a prophet with his former role as a shepherd ( Amos 7:14 ) .\nDr. Joachim Jeremias says shepherds were \u201c despised in everyday life.\n\u201d In general , they were considered second-class and untrustworthy .\nShepherding had not just lost its widespread appeal ; it eventually forfeited its social acceptability .\nSome shepherds earned their poor reputations , but others became victims of a cruel stereotype .\nThe religious leaders maligned the shepherd \u2019 s good name ; rabbis banned pasturing sheep and goats in Israel , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judaism \u2019 s written record of the oral law , also reflects this prejudice , referring to shepherds in belittling terms .\nOne passage describes them as \u201c incompetent ; \u201d another says no one should ever feel obligated to rescue a shepherd who has fallen into a pit .\nJeremias documents the fact that shepherds were deprived of all civil rights .\nThey could not fulfil judicial offices or be admitted in court as witnesses .\nHe wrote , \u201c To buy wool , milk or a kid from a shepherd was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be stolen property.\n\u201d In Jerusalem in the time of Jesus , Jeremias notes : \u201c The rabbis ask with amazement how , given the despicable nature of shepherds , one can explain why God was called \u2018 my shepherd \u2019 in Psalm 23:1.\n\u201d Smug religious leaders maintained a strict caste system at the expense of shepherds and other common folks .\nShepherds were officially labeled \u201c sinners \u201d \u2014a technical term for a class of despised people .\nInto this social context of religious snobbery and class prejudice , God \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and significant that Father God handpicked lowly , unpretentious shepherds to first hear the joyous news : \u201c It \u2019 s a boy , and He \u2019 s the Messiah !\n\u201d What an affront to the religious leaders who were so conspicuously absent from the divine mailing list .\nEven from birth , Christ moved among the lowly .\nIt was the sinners , not the self-righteous that He came to save ( Mark 2:17 ) .\nThe proud religionists of Christ \u2019 s day have faded into obscurity , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pastors \u201c shepherd their flocks.\n\u201d That figure was immortalized by the Lord Jesus when He said , \u201c I am the good shepherd .\nThe good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep \u201d ( John 10:11 ) .\nChrist is also the Great Shepherd ( Hebrews 13:20 ) and the Chief Shepherd ( 1 Peter 5:4 ) .\nNo other illustration so vividly portrays His tender care and guiding hand .\nWhat do we really know about the wise men ?\nNot much when you examine the Scripture .\nWhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east , \u201d you say .\nBut where in the east ?\nHow far east ?\nBeaumont ?\nAtlanta ?\nAfrica ?\nWe know they came from the east and they came from a long way away , but we don \u2019 t really know where they came from .\nHow many of them were there and what kind of men were they ?\nAgain , we don \u2019 t know .\nIn the second century , a church father named Tertullian suggested that these men were kings because the Old Testament had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him .\nHe also concluded that there were three kings based on the number of gifts mentioned \u2013 gold , frankincense , and myrrh .\nAnd the manufacturers of nativity scenes caught on and so in every nativity scene , you see three kings or wise men .\nBut the Bible doesn \u2019 t tell us who they were or how many of them came .\nIn the sixth century , someone decided that their names were Melchior , Baltazar , and Gaspar .\nAnd so , operas have been written ascribing these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really knows what their names were .\nWe don \u2019 t even really know that they were wise .\nIn the original manuscripts , they are called the \u201c magi \u201d from an ancient Persian word , \u201c magoi \u201d which was used to describe people who acted in very strange ways , were captivated by astrology , spells , and incantation , and dressed in a very bizarre manner .\nThe Latin word is \u201c magi \u201d from which we get words like \u201c magician.\n\u201d You \u2019 ll see a clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King Arthur and the knights of the round table .\nYou \u2019 ll remember Merlin , the magician and the strange way he dressed .\nSo , we don \u2019 t know who they were , where they came from , or even how many of them there were .\nWhy not ?\nWhy doesn \u2019 t Matthew tell us any of this information ?\nI \u2019 m not sure I know with certainty , but I \u2019 d suggest that all of this detail is left out of the picture so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one thing that is central to this story , namely their statement , \u201c We have come to worship.\n\u201d That \u2019 s the main point of this particular story as Matthew tells it to us .\n\u201c We have come to worship.\n\u201d And as we look at what Matthew tells us about these men , although they may have been strange little men who dressed weird , they really were wise men .\nAnd the challenge for us today is whether we will be wise men and women .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wise men still serve Him , and wise men still worship Him .\nPhilippians 4:13 says , \u201c I can do everything through him who gives me strength.\n\u201d Orthodox Judaism up until today bases its theory that Messiah has not arrived yet on the lack of peace in the world , which stands in contrast to what they perceive to be the ultimate sign of His coming described in : The cry of this age is peace , peace , and peace !\nMen are looking for peace and security .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and life security \u2013 a time when war will cease , and universal peace will prevail forever .\nGod has promised a golden age of peace , a time when war , famine , flood , and disease will cease .\nTheologians call this age \u201c The Millennium.\n\u201d The term \u201c Millennium \u201d is not found in the Bible but comes from two Latin words , \u201c mille \u201d ( thousand ) and \u201c annum \u201d ( year ) .\nHaving reference to the thousand-year reign of Christ .\nWhat is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt on the way to work ?\nIs it to arrive safely back home ?\nIs it to live comfortably ?\nThe world is ready to give you this kind of peace as long as you don \u2019 t ask for more .\nIn fact , this is a false peace , preached by false prophets .\nPeace without God is like becoming addicted to alcohol or drugs .\nWhen the hangover comes , it is painful .\nThe father of all lies promises peace by man .\nThe UN is representing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe Gift of His Peace May we all be wise enough to choose the Prince of
