to watch for the first time one of the \u201c walks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over Germany since authorities have banned demonstrations .\nI know from the newspaper that the police have issued a general order on FFP2 masks to make it easier to take tougher action against walkers .\nThe medical bogus arguments are no longer used , so I put a mask in my pocket .\nAt the Town Hall , the designated meeting place , I can only see a huge police contingent .\nI stroll alone to the state parliament , where a large group of people are being detained and requested to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stay away from that and continue to Hanover \u2019 s Kr\u00f6pcke central square , where on this mild January evening several hundred people can be found , most of them on their way to or from the shops .\nKeeping an eye out for possible walkers , I stop for a moment and a lady standing next to me abruptly says she hasn \u2019 t been downtown for ages because of lockdowns and masks .\nAs I feel the same way , we admire the Christmas decorations together for half a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are suddenly five police officers in front of us and , as I turn around , about ten to fifteen behind us , forming a ring around the lady , myself and maybe eight other , mostly elderly people .\nAsked what this means , a blonde policewoman answers me that she hereby declares us an [ illegal ] assembly .\nI immediately put on my FFP2 mask , am honestly shocked and reply that this is probably a civic prank .\nAs a result of the police presence and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now many spectators in the square , and basically any lot of persons could be surrounded from behind and declared an \u201c assembly \u201d .\nAn acquaintance who happens to be passing by wants to join me , but she is not allowed into police surrounded group , and I am not allowed out .\nMore and more police officers arrive , also spectators , and the whole scene is getting filmed many times over .\nI also receive shouts from people who recognize me and express their surprise at this strange measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used and the police officers are verbally attacked harshly by the bystanders .\nAfter about a quarter of an hour , things get serious : I am taken away by three men , and when I ask what I am accused of , I get the answer : violation of the obligation to wear a mask .\nI reply that I am wearing one , even FFP2 , and have been since the group formed .\nBut it is of no use : I should have been wearing the mask before the group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prove that this was not the case .\nNow that I am away from the others , I only notice out of the corner of my eye that others who are not wearing masks are worse off .\nMaybe because they just wanted to walk through the city and for that reason didn \u2019 t have one with them .\nIn any case , I hear commotion and screams , but as a detained person I can not investigate .\nAfter taking my personal details , the police tell me that proceedings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am banished from the entire city center .\nYet , the police officer in charge is unable to define the boundaries of the area .\nInstead , he threatens me with imprisonment in case of a violation .\nFirstly , the police can , through underhanded singling out , pin a case on anyone who is outside their home , and that is probably the point of the action .\nSecondly , if this can not be called fascism , where does it actually begin ?\nOr to put it another way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put up with ?\nDr Stefan Homburg is a retired university professor of public finance at Leibniz University in

this list had only 50 papers on it ( as indicated by the web address ) .\nIn less than 6 years the list has grown to 137 ( as of today ) .\nClick on the link for the full list .\nA few of the sample papers are shown here .\nThe HITRAN database of gaseous absorption spectra enables the absorption of earth radiation at its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined for each individual atmospheric constituent and also for the combined absorption of the atmosphere as a whole .\nFrom this data it is concluded that H2O is responsible for 29.4K of the 33K warming , with CO2 contributing 3.3K and CH4 and N2O combined just 0.3K .\nClimate sensitivity to future increases in CO2 concentration is calculated to be 0.50K , including the positive feedback effects of H2O , while climate sensitivities to CH4 and N2O are almost undetectable at 0.06K and 0.08K respectively .\nThis result strongly suggests that increasing levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes in earth temperature and that increases in CH4 and N2O will have very little discernable impact .\nBased on new radiative transfer numerical evaluations , we reconsider an argument presented by Schack in 1972 that says that saturation of the absorption of infrared radiation by carbon dioxide in the atmosphere sets in as soon as the relative concentration of carbon dioxide exceeds a lower limit of approximately 300 ppm .\nWe provide a concise brief and explicit representation of the greenhouse effect of the earth \u2019 s atmosphere .\nWe find an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration ) of \u2206T \u2243 0.5\u00b0C .\nWe elaborate on the consistency of these results on \u2206T with results observationally obtained by satellite-based measurements of short-time radiation-flux versus surface-temperature changes .\n\u2026 The absorption reaches values close to 100 % for a realistic CO2 content of 0.03 % , it is concluded that any further increase of ( anthropogenic ) CO2 can not lead to an appreciably stronger absorption of radiation , and consequently can not affect the earth \u2019 s climate .\n\u2026 [ T ] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the climate on earth is fairly negligible .\nCO2 makes up only a tiny portion of the atmosphere ( 0.040 % ) and constitutes only 3.6 % of the greenhouse effect .\nThe atmospheric content of CO2 has increased only 0.008 % since emissions began to soar after 1945 .\nSuch a tiny increment of increase in CO2 can not cause the 10\u00b0F increase in temperature predicted by CO2 advocates .\nComputer climate modelers build into their models a high water vapor component , which they claim is due to increased atmospheric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from CO2 , and since water vapor makes up 90\u201395 % of the greenhouse effect , they claim the result will be warming .\nThe problem is that atmospheric water vapor has actually declined since 1948 , not increased as demanded by climate models .\nIf CO2 causes global warming , then CO2 should always precede warming when the Earth \u2019 s climate warms up after an ice age .\nHowever , in all cases , CO2 lags warming by \u223c800 years .\nShorter time spans show the same thing\u2014warming always precedes an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be the

% of discernible correlations are negative .\nSpectral analysis , auto- and cross-correlation show that proxies for T , atmospheric CO concentration and \u0394RF oscillate across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u0394RF are antiphasic .\nA prominent 15 million-year CO cycle coincides closely with identified mass extinctions of the past , suggesting a pressing need for research on the relationship between CO

.\nIn assessing of the climate effects of 319 wind farms , the authors have determined wind power-warming can amount to as much as 0.10\u00b0C per year ( 1\u00b0C per decade ) in nighttime temperature

Christof Kuhbandner uncovered what he calls an extremely alarming situation , one where thousands and thousands of vaccine deaths are being hidden in the statistics .\nAccording to this Austrian report broadcast by servus.tv , Prof. Kuhbandner happened to come across a recent preprint study in the journal ResearchGate , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortality surveillance report .\nAlthough at first glance the all-cause mortality appeared far lower in the vaccinated than the unvaccinated , on closer inspection they found fundamental inconsistencies and anomalies in the data and that there had been a \u201c systemic miscategorization of deaths between the different categories of unvaccinated and vaccinated \u201d among other factors .\nFor the period of calendar week 1-38 , 2021 , Figures 8 and 9 show strong peaks in non-Covid mortality for the unvaccinated 60-69 and 70-79 age groups while the mortality among the vaccinated stayed steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the vaccines were functioning well in England and Wales .\nBut the ending is not a happy one .\nDisturbing : The peaks did occur at the same time Prof. Kuhbandner noted something very unusual was going on and examined the trend also for the 80+ age group as well .\nThe following are the plots for all three age groups .\nThe peaks and deaths were offset .\nMoreover , the paper \u2019 s authors also commented : In other words , the vaccines were rolled out in stages , first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old ) and then to the next group ( 70-79 ) and then to the 60-69 group some weeks later .\nThe death peaks then followed the vaccination stages .\nSo why would people NOT getting the vaccine be the ones dying in huge numbers , and not those getting the vaccine ?\nThis is because in Europe the status of \u201c vaccinated \u201d first gets assigned 14 days after getting the final jab .\nThus any deaths occurring before this , ends up being counted as an \u201c unvaccinated death \u201d !\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine dies less than 14 days later , he/she gets counted as an unvaccinated death .\nThis is how vaccine deaths are getting hidden .\nAnd there many thousands .\nAs Figures 5-7 above show , thousands of deaths occurred shortly after the vaccines had been administered , and many among them were likely linked to the vaccine itself .\nIf this is the case globally , and not just in Britain , then the number of vaccine deaths may be profound .\nThe nightmare appears to be true , Prof Kuhbandner shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data for Germany and found the very same pattern : large jumps in mortality immediately following the vaccine campaigns .\nThese deaths appear to be directly the result of vaccinations .\nIt \u2019 s just too coincidental to be dismissed .\nCarnage equivalent to two commercial jets crashing every day \u201c When you express this in numbers , it translates to 700 more deaths a day on average , \u2019 Kuhbandner tells servus.tv , looking just at the German numbers .\n\u201c It would be like two

has become more and more common for scientists to attribute modern radiation budget ( climate ) changes to variations in cloud cover .\nThis should not be surprising .\nIt \u2019 s been pointed out ( van Heerwaarden et al.\n, 2021 ) that removing clouds from atmosphere at noon leads to +251 W/m\u00b2 additional radiative forcing .\nCompare this value to the entirety of the cumulative CO2 forcing since 1750 : 1.82 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the papers published in 2021 that substantially attribute modern climate changes to variations in clouds .\n\u201c The clouds represent a key element within the terrestrial climate system .\nIn fact , clouds may be the most important parameter controlling the radiation budget , and , hence , the Earth climate ( Hughes , 1983 ) .\nThis is related to the fact that clouds have a paramount importance in the radiation balance at global scale , especially due to their albedo ( Ohring and Clapp , 1980 ) .\n\u2026 Chiacchio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that more positive NAO during 1985\u20132000 is linked with the increase of solar radiation in Europe due to lower amounts of cloud cover which are characteristic for the southern part of the continent during positive NAO .\nThey showed that NAO , generally anticorrelated with cloud cover at continental scale , represents one of the most important drivers of changes in solar radiation in Europe .\nSf\u00eec\u0103 et al .\n( 2017 ) found that higher values of sunshine duration during winter in Romania are linked with an intense westerly circulation at continental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is an important link between atmospheric circulation and cloud cover .\nThe effect on surface radiation of the decrease in cloud cover adds to the observed decrease of the optical thickness of aerosols leading to the so\u2010called brightening period during the last decennia ( Russak , 2009 ; Pfeifroth et al.\n, 2018a ) .\n\u201d \u201c The consequence is a decrease in ionization in more than 80 % of the area of Earth and an increase in polar regions .\nObservation in polar regions and the rest of the Earth demonstrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in polar regions31 .\nThese and the present observations are consistent with a cosmic ray-aerosol-cloud link .\n\u2026 From the spatial maps , it is clear that the primary responses are over the oceans and that low liquid clouds are mainly responsible for the change in net radiative forcing .\nThe global response in net radiation to the average of the five strongest FD is approximately 2 W/m2 .\n\u2026 A consistent picture is emerging , suggesting that variations in ionization are connected to aerosols and clouds , and now also the energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effect on the Earth \u2019 s energy budget has been quantified directly using detailed satellite observations from the CERES instrument on NASA \u2019 s Terra and Aqua satellites .\nThe observation is that Earth absorbs almost 2 W/m2 extra energy within 4 to 6 days of the cosmic-ray minimum.\n\u201d \u201c Earth \u2019 s Energy Imbalance ( EEI ) is a relatively small ( presently \u223c0.3 % ) difference between global mean solar radiation absorbed and thermal infrared radiation emitted to space .\nEEI is set by natural and anthropogenic climate forcings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those forcings .\nIt is also influenced by internal variations within the climate system .\nMost of EEI warms the ocean ; the remainder heats the land , melts ice , and warms the atmosphere .\nWe show that independent satellite and in situ observations each yield statistically indistinguishable decadal increases in EEI from mid-2005 to mid-2019 of 0.50 \u00b1 0.47 W/m\u00b2 decade\u00af1 ( 5 % \u201395 % confidence interval ) .\nThis trend is primarily due to an increase in absorbed solar radiation associated with decreased reflection by clouds and sea-ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( OLR ) due to increases in trace gases and water vapor .\nThese changes combined exceed a positive trend in OLR due to increasing global mean temperatures.\n\u201d \u201c The drop of cloudiness around the millennium by about 1.5 % has certainly fostered the positive net radiative flux .\nThe declining TOA SW ( out ) is the major heating cause ( +1.42 W/m\u00b2 from 2001 to 2020 ) .\nIt is almost compensated by the growing chilling TOA LW ( out ) ( \u22121.1 W/m\u00b2 ) .\nThis leads together with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a small growth of imbalance of 0.15 W/m\u00b2 .\nWe further present surface flux data which support the strong influence of the cloud cover on the radiative budget.\n\u201d \u201c The SW anomaly impacts show that there are natural climate drivers that have rapid and significant temperature impacts exceeding the anthropogenic drivers for the period of 2000- 2019 .\nThe IPCC and the climate community have claimed that the natural climate impacts have been close to zero as also shown by the GCM simulations by Gillet .\nThe GCMs show still the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is well-known that the present average yearly CO2 increase of 2.5 ppm causes only a 0.02\u00b0C temperature increase .\nAlso , the rapid temperature decline from 0.4\u00b0C in October 2020 to -0.05\u00b0C in April 2021 per UAH temperature [ 19 ] .\nshows that it can not be due to anthropogenic reasons .\nThe temperature increase since the 2015\u201316 El Nino year can not be due to anthropogenic reasons , but it has been omitted , even though the SW anomaly should be well-known.\n\u201d \u201c The reflectance of the Earth is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Big Bear Solar Observatory between 1998 and 2017 by observing the earthshine using modern photometric techniques to precisely determine daily , monthly , seasonal , yearly and decadal changes in terrestrial albedo from earthshine .\nWe find the inter-annual fluctuations in albedo to be global , while the large variations in albedo within individual nights and seasonal wanderings tend to average out over each year .\nWe measure a gradual , but climatologically significant 0.5 W/m\u00b2 decline in the global albedo over the two decades of data .\n\u2026 For comparison , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W/m\u00b2 over the same period.\n\u201d \u201c The solar downward shortwave radiation ( DSWR ) is the primary source of energy to Earth and a driving forcing for sensible/latent heat and water vapor fluxes over the terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere .\nEvaluation of the DSWR spatiotemporal patterns and trends is crucial to the understanding of weather and climate variability .\nIn this study , DSWR is investigated over Brazil between 1980 and 2016 from contemporary state-of-the-art high-resolution gridded datasets ( observations , reanalyses and merged products ) .\nThe results show an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all regions of Brazil , with large changes over the northern , west central , and southeastern parts of the country .\nThe European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast ( ERA5 ) reanalysis proves to be an excellent option for investigating DSWR across Brazil , matching the observed climatology trends well.\n\u201d \u201c Changes in cloud cover ( CC ) are linked to changes in DSWR .\nDecadal fluctuations in CC are highly correlated with DSWR trends , with the strongest correlation ( r = \u22120.89 ) in the southeast region , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) in the north .\nWe conclude that CC is a primary modulating factor of brightening across Brazil between 1980 and 2016 .\nIn a global context , our results agree with observations from other regions over the globe.\n\u201d \u201c The record of downwelling solar irradiance and other surface radiation budget components for the U.S. has been extended through 2019 using SURFRAD Network data .\nBrightening of surface solar irradiance of +7.36 W/m\u00b2/decade occurred from 1996 through 2012 .\nIn 2013 , surface solar radiation sharply decreased to the long-term mean ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level through 2017 .\n\u2026 Aerosol optical depth decreased continuously throughout the tenure of the network but accounted for only 3 % of the variability of surface solar irradiance , while cloud fraction explained 62 % .\n\u201d \u201c Collectively , these results indicate that changing cloud cover was the primary source of brightening and dimming over the U.S. from 1996 to 2019.\n\u201d \u201c Downwelling solar radiation at the surface ( SW\u2193 ) goes through decadal-scale variations that are global in nature ( Dutton et al.\n, 2006 ; Gilgen et al.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2005 , 2020 ; Herman et al.\n, 2013 ; Liepert , 2002 ; Liepert et al.\n, 1994 ; Ohmura

W/m\u00b2/decade from the 1950s to the 1980s , and +10 W/m\u00b2/decade from the 1990s to 2005 .\nThe most recent updates for Europe ( Sanchez-Lorenzo et al.\n, 2015 ; Wild , 2016 ; Wild et al.\n, 2021 ) indicate that brightening may have stopped there after 2010 , although the short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establish an onset of an actual shift to dimming .\nOhmura ( 2009 ) reports dimming of \u22126.3 W/m\u00b2/decade in Japan from 1960 to 1991 and then brightening of +6.2 W/m\u00b2/decade to 2008.\n\u201d \u201c In the 1980s , the trend reversed and \u201c global brightening \u201d began ( Wild 2009 ) .\nIn the years 1987\u20132002 , Europe witnessed an increase in the amount of incoming shortwave radiation , S\u2193 , reaching 1.0 % per decade ( Norris and Wild 2007 ) ; then , it accelerated to 2.2 % per decade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2009 ) .\nThe trend was verified by observations carried out using satellites .\nIn 1984\u20132000 , the trends of S\u2193 and S* were 2.4 and 2.2 W/m\u00b2 per decade , respectively ( Hatzianastassiou et al .\n2005 ) , and in 1983\u20132015 , they were 1.9 and 2.4 W/m\u00b2 decade\u22121 ( Pfeifroth et al .\n2018 ) .\nIn Poland , also , growing

indicator of the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth \u2019 s surface .\nIn the current discussion on the causes of global warming , the analysis of the spatial and temporal variability of SD

.\nThe years 1971\u20131980 mark the end of \u201c global dimming , \u201d which was manifested in very low values of actual and relative sunshine duration .\n\u201c Global brightening \u201d confirms a statistically significant growing trend in sunshine duration at all the analysed meteorological stations in Poland from April to September .\nThere is a strong statistically significant relationship between the areal totals of sunshine duration and the type of pressure system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optical depth.\n\u201d \u201c In each month , the correlation coefficients between the area-average monthly SD and the area-average monthly general cloud cover over Poland are high and statistically significant ( Figure 8 ) .\nIn Europe , the period of short SD is associated with the heavy cloud cover associated with low-pressure systems in the years 1971\u20131980 , while the decrease in cloud cover is caused by the predominance of high-pressure systems in the last two decades of the 20th century ( Kysel\u00fd and Huth , 2006 ; Sanchez-Lorenzo et al.\n, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 21st century ( Matuszko and W\u0119glarczyk , 2018 ) .\nTrends in the magnitude of cloud cover in Europe are confirmed by the course of the multi-annual area-average annual general cloud cover over Poland ( Figure 9 ) .\n\u201d \u201c The Arctic is rapidly changing , with increasingly dramatic sea ice loss and surface warming in recent decades .\nShortwave radiation plays a key role in Arctic warming during summer months , and absorbed shortwave radiation has been increasing largely because of greater sea ice loss .\nClouds can influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shortwave radiation incident on the Arctic Ocean .\nIn turn , clouds impact the amount of time that must elapse before forced trends in Arctic shortwave absorption emerge from internal variability .\nThis study determines whether the forced climate response of absorbed shortwave radiation in the Arctic has emerged in the modern satellite record and global climate models .\nFrom 18 years of satellite observations from CERES-EBAF , we find that recent declines in sea ice are large enough to produce a statistically significant trend ( 1.7 \u00d7 106 PJ or 3.9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbed shortwave radiation .\nHowever , clouds preclude any forced trends in all-sky absorption from emerging within the existing satellite record.\n\u201d \u201c Clouds play a critical role in the ice sheet surface mass balance , both by providing mass input in the form of precipitation and by modulating the net radiation at the surface , thus influencing surface melt and run-off ( Bennartz et al.\n, 2013 ; Van Tricht et al.\n, 2016 ; Hofer et al.\n, 2017 ; Miller et al.\n, 2017 ) .\n\u201d \u201c Mixed-phase clouds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface warming over the GrIS ( Miller et al.\n, 2015 ; Van Tricht et al.\n, 2016 ) , are sensitive to the number concentration of cloud condensation nuclei and ice-nucleating particles ( e.g .\nNorgren et al.\n, 2018 ; Solomon et al.\n, 2018 ) , where cloud condensation nuclei ( CCN ) are a subset of aerosol particles on which liquid droplets can form , and ice-nucleating particles ( INPs ) are a subset of aerosols that can catalyse the formation of ice crystals.\n\u201d \u201c Clouds are an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their complex interactions with other components of the climatic system .\nThe main one is the influence on the radiative transfer in the solar or shortwave radiation ( spectral interval : 0.2 \u00b5m to 4 \u00b5m ) and in the terrestrial or longwave radiation ( spectral interval higher than 4 \u00b5m ) .\nThose interactions occur via the scattering and absorption in the solar spectrum and mainly by absorption and emission in the terrestrial spectrum .\nThe main effect of clouds on the solar radiation is the large backward scattering produced by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1986 ; Stephens , 2005 ; Mitchell and Finnegan , 2009 ) .\nBecause of that , the earth\u2013atmosphere system albedo basically depends on the clouds and their properties .\nAt the earth \u2019 s surface the clouds effect on the solar radiation basically depends on the microphysical ( i.e .\nparticle size ) and macrophysical ( i.e .\ncloud base and cloud top ) properties of clouds and the sun disk location respect with the measurement point.\n\u201d \u201c Here , we show that the SST anomaly over the GBR is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than with ENSO .\nThis significant relationship between local cloud cover and SST can be found over two-thirds of the study domain even when the ENSO impact is ignored .\nAccordingly , we conclude that local-scale reduced cloud cover plays an important role in regional warming of the shallow water over the GBR , regardless of the large-scale ENSO impact.\n\u201d \u201c Lagged regional sea surface temperature ( SST ) is correlated with total cloud cover across the Great Barrier Reef ( GBR ) and direct shortwave cloud radiative forcing.\n\u201d \u201c Local-scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the shallow water warming over the GBR and the occurrence of thermal coral bleaching events \u2026 Lagged regional sea surface temperature ( SST ) is correlated with total cloud cover across the Great Barrier Reef ( GBR ) and direct shortwave cloud radiative forcing.\n\u201d \u201c Local-scale reduced cloud cover plays a crucial role in the shallow water warming over the GBR and the occurrence of thermal coral bleaching events.\n\u201d \u201c Cosmic rays affect cloud cover variation .\nClouds reflect both the incoming solar radiation flux upward and the earth \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus clouds control thermal energy input to the lower atmosphere and establishes a link between cosmic rays and the terrestrial temperature .\n\u2026 Clouds play an important role in modulating the heat budget of the lower atmosphere .\nWe know that clouds acting as an opaque medium control thermal energy input to the lower atmosphere .\nSo , one can expect a link between cosmic rays and cloud cover over the earth.\n\u201d \u201c The observed SWin exhibited significant inter-daily variations that are associated with changes in cloud conditions .\nFor example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W/m\u00b2 at JI .\nTwo days later , SWin dropped to 142.1 W/m\u00b2 before doubling its values two days later.\n\u201d \u201c COD [ cloud optical depth ] variations therefore have a non-negligible impact on the surface radiative balance .\nFor \u03b8=60\u2218 , for example , there is an approximately 200 W/m\u00b2 difference in SWd [ downwelling shortwave ] between the optically thinnest and thickest clouds .\nThis translates into a total shortwave cloud forcing that ranges between \u221220 and \u221260 W/m\u00b2 , assuming an albedo of 0.8 ( typical of the N-ICE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is significant when it is contrasted to the typical longwave forcing of \u224860 W/m\u00b2 : even for \u03b8=60\u2218 , only the optically thickest clouds could contribute to cool the surface during the April\u2013June N-ICE2015 campaign period .\n\u2026 The surface impact of Arctic clouds is also seasonally variable .\nIn October and November , clouds warm the surface : 2 m temperatures associated with cloudless profiles are up to 8 K colder than those associated with profiles containing at least one low cloud.\n\u201d \u201c At Gasyoura station , a location closer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig .\n1 ) , the signatures of the dust radiative forcing observed at Al Ain were more pronounced ( Fig .\n9 ) .\nTemperatures during night did not go below 37 \u00b0C being 11 \u00b0C higher than nocturnal-temperature lows before and after the dust storm ( Fig .\n9a ) .\nHowever , the maximum in temperature during day decreased by 3 \u00b0C ( Fig .\n9a ) due to the reduction in SW radiation at the surface by the thick layer of dust .\nIndeed , the dust cloud induced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the surface on 29 and 30 July 2018 ( Fig .\n9b ) , similar to the findings by previous studies on spring dust storms over central AP ( Prakash et al.\n, 2015 ) and over the UAE ( Karagulian et al.\n, 2019 ) .\n\u2026 Here , the model also overestimated the SW reduction by 300 W/m\u00b2 compared to the observations on 28 July 2018\u2033 \u201c Model runs corresponding to past climate show a substantial decrease in low clouds and hence planetary albedo compared with present , which contributes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offset the faint Sun .\nThrough time , the climatically important stratocumulus decks have grown in response to a brightening Sun and decreasing greenhouse effect , driven by stronger cloud-top radiative cooling ( which drives low cloud formation ) and a stronger inversion ( which sustains clouds against dry air entrainment from above ) .\nWe find that systematic changes to low clouds have had a major role in stabilizing climate through Earth \u2019 s history , which demonstrates the importance of physical feedbacks on long-term climate stabilization , and a smaller role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] he presence of cloud-radiative effects shapes the circulation in the present-day climate in many important ways , including the width of the tropical rain belts and the position of the extratropical storm tracks .\nCloud locking , in contrast , identified how clouds affect internal variability and the circulation response to global warming .\nThis includes strong , but model-dependent , shortwave and longwave cloud impacts on the El-Nino Southern Oscillation , and the finding that most of the poleward circulation expansion in response to global warming can be attributed to radiative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circulation impact of shortwave changes from low-level clouds and longwave changes from rising high-level clouds , and the contribution of these cloud changes to model differences in the circulation response to global warming .\nThe review in particular draws attention to the role of cloud-radiative heating within the atmosphere.\n\u201d \u201c Cloud acts as an important and uncertain factor in climate change prediction and simulation ( Duan and Wu , 2006 ) .\nIt plays crucial roles in the Earth\u2013atmosphere energy and radiation budgets .\nWarren et al .\n( 2007 ) reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloud amount and surface temperature in the North Hemisphere .\nThe decreased total cloud amount contributes to warming over Tibet ( Duan and Wu , 2006 ; Guo and Wang , 2012 ) .\nTang and Leng ( 2012 ) emphasized that clouds are an important local factor that adjusts the temperature variation in Eurasia.\n\u201d \u201c Clouds are an important factor that influence summer temperature via the energy budget and global hydrological cycle ( Tang and Leng , 2013 ; Yang et al.\n, 2020 ) .\n\u2026 The correlations between summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summer skin temperature has an evident dependence on the cloud amount and varies in different clouds.\n\u201d \u201c [ S ] ummer cloud amount is an important indicator for temperature variations , especially the MHCC .\nThe decreased precipitation matches the reduced TCC .\nThe summer precipitation in Tibet is primarily influenced by the cloud amount , especially HCC and MHCC .\n\u2026 Warming and decreased precipitation in the past two decades are primarily related to cloud amount changes .\n\u2026 Clouds , via their interactions with radiation , shape the atmospheric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201d", "author": "Kenneth Richard", "url":

4000-page IPCC reports and sophisticated but often dubious computer simulations are meant to impress the public and to obfuscate the basic facts of the papers that are presented .\nFor ordinary people

parts of earth \u2019 s history that would not be in line with their claims .\nOur planet started as a white-hot molten lava sphere some 4.5 billion years ago .\nOver a timespan of just a few hundred million years , it cooled from several thousand \u00b0C to below 100 \u00b0C , the precondition for the first oceans to appear .\nAnd since that event , at least some 3.8 billion years ago , the earth \u2019 s cooling virtually stopped .\nUp to now , temperatures have stayed within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60-80 \u00b0C .\nThe undeniable proof for this is that organic life has been present on our planet since at least 3,45 million years 1 ) , with geneticists even pushing this limit to more than 4 billion years ago .\nFurthermore , these genetic records suggest that since there has been no interruption in this heritage chain , temperature levels can never have strayed too far from this temperature window .\nPlanet earth thus has a fantastic thermostat that kicked in when oceans appeared and has kept temperatures in an astonishingly narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout incredible catastrophes like giant asteroid impacts , changing chemistry of atmosphere and oceans , seismic catastrophes , formidable volcanic eruptions and a steadily increasing level of solar radiation .\nTo get an idea of what earth must have gone through , just look at the scars on the moon \u2019 s surface in a clear night .\nWe received at least the same bombardment , but oceans , tectonic movements and erosion have graciously glossed over most of the marks .\nFigure 2 .\nAfter earth had formed , temperatures dropped very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narrow window that supports life ever since ( Graphic : Author ) No engineer would could ever been able to imagine and install a planetary thermostat with such a

gave some clever people the ability to program climate simulations that stipulate that we are just a few years short of reaching a no-return tipping point that will ultimately extinguish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth as well .\nWhy climatologists use terms like \u201c unprecedented \u201d or \u201c never seen before \u201d ?\nThe incredibly turbulent and notwithstanding astonishingly stable climate history of earth holds many examples of conditions and extremes that are unknown to most contemporaries , with the exception of a small number of paleo-specialists .\nEven worse , the scientific base of modern meteorology is very recent and barely spans more than about 150 years .\nAnd the worldwide network of weather stations had many blind spots and blank areas sometimes well into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only start when weather satellites started orbiting the globe since the early 1960s .\nThe scientific basis for long-term analyses of weather and climate is thus quite short .\nFor events further back

colder than 2018 .\nTo boot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warm Period had 0.5\u00b0C warmer global-scale temperatures than today .\n\u201c For instance , the Medieval Climatic Optimum ( MCO ) ( 1100-1250 ) was with high global surface temperature ( about 0.5\u00b0C warmer than the current warm period ) .\n\u201d \u201c The effect of sustained high solar-geomagnetic activity into the early 2000s , together with the large thermal inertia of the oceans which is about 72 % of the climate system , explains why global surface temperature continued to rise when solar activity had apparently declined since the mid-1980s .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variation of solar activity and global surface temperature observed since 1987 ( Lockwood and Fr\u00f6lich , 2007 ) is most likely not related to the observed increase in anthropogenic GHGs emissions .\nFurthermore , the observed and continuous decrease in the rate of global warming , which commenced with a hiatus ( 1998-2013 ) , should be seen as the response of the climate system to current deeply declining solar activity after the long-term trend of solar-geomagnetic activity maximum in 2003.\n\u201d \u201c Solar cycle 25 which began in 2020 is expected to @ @

causation requirement that solar activity leads global temperature by about 6 to 8 years ( average , 7 years ) , the coldest phase of global temperature should occur between 2038-2039 \u00b111 years .\nThus our result is within the predicted range .\nFurthermore , the predicted temperature anomaly for 2100 is approximately0.0893 \u00b0C , which is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of 2018

retreat/precipitation extremes\u2026experienced during the modern era are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they fall outside the range of natural variability .\nN ( 3 ) The computer climate models are neither reliable or consistently accurate ; the uncertainty and error ranges are irreducible ; and projections of future climate states ( i.e.\n, an intensification of the hydrological cycle ) are not supported by observations and/or are little more than speculation .\nN ( 4 ) Current emissions-mitigation policies , especially related to the advocacy for renewables , are often ineffective and even harmful to the environment , whereas elevated CO2 and a warmer climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i.e.\n, a greener planet and enhanced crop yields , lower mortality with warming ) .\nIn sharp contrast to the above , the corresponding \u201c consensus \u201d positions that these papers do not support are : A ( 1 ) Close to or over 100 % ( 110 % ) of the warming since 1950 has been caused by increases in anthropogenic

, unless an external agent acts upon it .\n\u2026 [ H ] eat exchange by evaporation ( and hence the latent heat transfer from the Earth \u2019 s surface to the atmosphere ) is the Earth \u2019 s natural locomotive , with the total energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ZJ/year , corresponding to an energy flux density of 80 W/m2 .\nCompared to human energy production ( 0.612 ZJ/year for 2014 ) , the total energy of the natural locomotive is 2100 times higher than that of the human locomotive \u2026 Even though in the common perception it is carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) that determines the greenhouse effect of the Earth , recent studies ( Schmidt et al .\n[ 69 ] ) attribute only 19 % of the longwave radiation absorption to CO2 against 75 % of water vapour and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u2026 Another misconception , common in nonexperts , is that atmospheric CO2 ; is the product of human emissions , while in fact the latter contribute only 3.8 % to the global carbon cycle .\n\u2026 [ U ] sing reliable instrumental measurements of global T and CO2 concentration covering the time interval 1980\u20132019 , a recent study found that in the relationship of CO2 and temperature , the dominant causality direction is T \u2192 CO2 , rather than the other way round , despite the latter being the common perception .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the additional spectrum range between 1200 cm\u22121 and 2600 cm\u22121 , the radiative parameters due to CO2 molecules are close in these evaluations and in the previous one .\nIn particular , the variation in radiative fluxes as a result of the change in the carbon dioxide amount in the atmosphere for these calculations are close .\nIn this evaluation as well as previous evaluations , we have a contradiction with the results of climatological models in the analysis of the Earth \u2019 s greenhouse effect , according to which the increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times .\n[ T ] he large difference results from ignoring , in climatological models , the Kirchhoff law [ 50 ] , according to which radiators are simultaneously the absorbers .\nIn this case , we take the change in the radiative flux created by CO2 molecules as the change of the total radiative flux .\nNote the restrictions by the frequency range up to 1200 cm\u22121 in the previous calculations [ 1 ] ; we thus assume that the atmosphere is transparent for larger frequencies , and the emission at larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to the HITRAN data bank , water molecules absorb effectively in the enlarged frequency range .\n[ A ] tmospheric CO2 molecules are not the main radiator of the atmosphere .\nFrom these evaluations , it follows that water molecules in the atmosphere may be responsible for the observed heating of the Earth .\nThe HITRAN database of gaseous absorption spectra enables the absorption of earth radiation at its current temperature of 288K to be accurately determined for each individual atmospheric constituent and also for the combined absorption of the atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is concluded that H2O is responsible for 29.4K of the 33K warming , with CO2 contributing 3.3K and CH4 and N2O combined just 0.3K .\nClimate sensitivity to future increases in CO2 concentration is calculated to be 0.50K , including the positive feedback effects of H2O , while climate sensitivities to CH4 and N2O are almost undetectable at 0.06K and 0.08K respectively .\nThis result strongly suggests that increasing levels of CO2 will not lead to significant changes in earth temperature and that increases in CH4 and N2O will have very little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantify solar and anthropogenic influences on climate change , and to make some tentative predictions for the next hundred years .\nBy means of double regression , we evaluate linear combinations of the logarithm of the carbon dioxide concentration and the geomagnetic aa index as a proxy for solar activity .\nThereby , we reproduce the sea surface temperature ( HadSST ) since the middle of the 19th century with an adjusted R2 value of around 87 percent for a climate sensitivity ( of TCR type ) in the range of 0.6 K @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe solution of the double regression is quite sensitive : when including data from the last decade , the simultaneous occurrence of a strong El Ni\u00f1o and of low aa values leads to a preponderance of solutions with relatively high climate sensitivities around 1.6 K. If these later data are excluded , the regression delivers a significantly higher weight of the aa index and , correspondingly , a lower climate sensitivity going down to 0.6 K. The plausibility of such low values is discussed in view of recent experimental and satellite-borne measurements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of data collection will be needed to allow for a reliable distinction between low and high sensitivity values .\nIn the second part , which builds on recent ideas about a quasi-deterministic planetary synchronization of the solar dynamo , we make a first attempt to predict the aa index and the resulting temperature anomaly for various typical CO2 scenarios .\nEven for the highest climate sensitivities , and an unabated linear CO2 increase , we predict only a mild additional temperature rise of around 1 K until the end of the century , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature drop in the near future , followed by a rather flat temperature curve , is prognosticated .", "author": "Kenneth Richard", "url": "https://notrickszone.com/2022/02/14/hundreds-more-papers-published-in-2021-support-a-skeptical-position-on-climate-alarm/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=hundreds-more-papers-published-in-2021-support-a-skeptical-position-on-climate-alarm", "published": "Mon, 14 Feb 2022 16:52:33 +0000", "published_utc": 1644875553, "collection_utc": 1644882195}, {"id": "notrickszone--2022-02-15--Ireland, Sweden Show No January Warming Since 1988.

provided by a Hereon team whose study appeared in the journal Nature ( Akthar et al.\n, 2021 ) .\nThe turbines weaken the wind as they extract kinetic energy to generate electricity .\nDownwind of the wind turbines , so-called atmospheric wake vortices develop .\nThese are characterized by reduced wind speed as well as by special pressure conditions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions , the wind speed deficits can propagate up to 70 km behind the wind farms .\nUsing high-resolution hydrodynamic computer simulations , the team analyzed the effects on the southern North Sea for summer 2013 ( May to September ) .\nThe analysis shows a connection between wake vortices and changes in the momentum-driven exchange between the atmosphere and the water .\nThis in turn could affect the horizontal currents and stratification of the water .\nThe effects of wake vortices are strong enough to redirect the existing currents , which results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and salinity distribution in the areas of the

year-to-year variability , \u201d said Nils Christiansen , of the Hereon Institute for Coastal Systems , who was lead author on the study .\nAnother consequence of wake vortices is the mitigation of shear-related processes at the sea surface .\nIn other words , the turbulent mixing of the water surface caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the wind farm .\nWater is usually stratified , for example , a layer of warmer water lies on top of a layer of colder water .\nWind farms disrupt this natural stratification .\nBecause of the reduced mixing , a more stable stratification of the water is favored .\nThis was particularly noticeable during the decline in summer stratification .\nNatural stratification of water is particularly prominent in summer and decreases toward fall .\nHowever , in the

considerable gains in knowledge .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n( Epic survival story ) .\nUnfortunately , the participants of the Franklin Expedition in 1845 fared quite differently .\nNone survived the search for the Northwest Passage , and only later did the mystery of the expedition \u2019 s failure unravel .\nOne reason for this tragic end was probably due to lead .\nIn the mid-19th century , food tins were soldered shut with lead .\nSir John Franklin took plenty of provisions with him , but some of them had been carried in cans .\nSo members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The few documents that were deposited in metal tubes in prominent specially erected landscape points ( e.g.\n, stone pyramids ) at that time indicate that the lead had affected the thinking of the crew .\nThey sometimes jotted

influence here .\nMuch worse , however , was the climate in the mid-19th century , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea route from Europe to Asia via America .\nFranklin , of course , had planned to winter in the Arctic and then find the route to the Pacific during the short Arctic summer .\nHowever , the ice did not melt as expected but , contrary to the hopes of the Arctic explorers , actually grew during the summer .\nAs a result , the ships did not make any progress even in the summer ; on the contrary , they drifted with the ice in a southerly direction , i.e .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1845 , very cool temperatures were noted for the British summer .\nIt was about 2 degrees cooler than usual according to these records .\nThe winters of 1846 and 1847 were thus even colder in England .\nThe summer of 1845 must also have been very wet .\nIt was the year that potato blight destroyed the crops in Ireland , causing famine .\nThe end of Franklin \u2019 s expedition was dramatic because there is much to

was based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long periods of time .\nIn such cores , temperatures can be read year by year .\nSteffensen even assumes that the end of the Little Ice Age was also the end of the coldest

level .\nOne should keep in mind , however , that Mann meant the entire northern hemisphere , while Steffensen only assumes Greenland , which is only a part of it .\nIt would be unusual , however , if Greenland had developed completely differently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut maybe simply the many poor quality verified tree ring data from Mann is a major problem ?\nA big difference in the curves is noticeable , though .\nIn Mann \u2019 s case , the curve drops only moderately toward the end of the Little Ice Age .\nAt the beginning of 1000 until the middle of the 19th century it remains quite stable with only a slight downward trend , in contrast to the ice core curves .\nIn Steffensen \u2019 s case , it goes down significantly after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of the 19th century .\nThe size of the anomaly is also very different .\nWhen it is just about 0.3 degrees Celsius at Mann , it is about 1.5 degrees at Steffensen , where it became cooler between the year 1000 and the

beginning of the industrialization of the world and the start of systematic weather recording .\nThese existed far before .\nDaniel Fahrenheit invented the mercury thermometer as early as 1714 , but the recording of weather data became much more relevant in the 19th century and the measurement network became wider .\nThe reasons , by the way , were also wars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anymore .\nDuring a

moment.\n\u201d The problem with such terms is that they unfortunately wear out very quickly because they are again more or less deadlines .\nThe BBC assumes that mankind has a maximum of 3 years left to turn the tide.. \u201c But keeping temperatures down will require massive changes to energy production , industry , transport , our consumption patterns and the way we treat nature .\nTo stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , means that carbon emissions from everything that we do , buy , use or eat must peak by 2025 , and tumble rapidly after that , reaching net-zero by the middle of this century .\nTo put it in context , the amount of CO2 that the world has emitted in the last decade is the same amount that \u2019 s left to us to stay under this key temperature threshold .\n\u201e I think the report tells us that we \u2019 ve reached the now-or-never point of limiting warming to 1.5C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ De Coninck , who \u2019 s Professor of Socio-Technical Innovation and Climate Change at Eindhoven University of Technology .\nSpeaking to BBC News she said : \u201e We have to peak our greenhouse gas emissions before 2025 and after that , reduce them very rapidly .\n\u201e And we will have to do negative emissions or carbon dioxide removal in the second half of the century , shortly after 2050 , in order to limit warming to 1.5C.\n\u201c \u201d Meanwhile Germany weekly Zeit also covers the report , but with somewhat less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Zeit also discusses measures that are either hardly used or even banned in Germany , such as carbon capture .\nBecause it can \u2019 t be completely implemented that way , all future unavoidable greenhouse gas emissions must be offset by pulling them back out of the atmosphere .\nHow can that be done ?\nThrough reforestation and other natural approaches , for example , but their effectiveness is shrinking as climate change progresses .\nOr mankind is turning to technologies such as carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) \u2013 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHowever , these methods are controversial and so far do not work adequately.\n\u201d Axel Bojanowski of Die Welt seems far less pessimistic .\nHe also addresses the issue of carbon capture in a factual article .\nNegative emissions could capture up to 12 complete annual rations of global greenhouse gas emissions by 2100 , the climate report says .\nDumping CO2 underground ( CCS , carbon capture and storage ) could make it possible to use fossil energy sources \u2018 for longer , \u2019 the IPCC writes .\nHowever , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially in Germany , and was therefore stopped , which the IPCC indirectly criticizes : The use of CCS worldwide is \u2018 far below the pathway for the two-degree target.\n\u2019 Policy instruments could reduce the barriers , the IPCC writes.\n\u201d In an opinion piece ( paywall article ) , Bojanowski writes about conflicting goals , among other things .\nAt the same time , the UN has set 16 other human goals in addition to limiting warming , such as overcoming hunger and poverty , improving education and health , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Above all , the IPCC recognizes opportunities for synergies with the other human goals .\nBut why is the push for fossil fuels still so strong , especially in poor countries , when , according to the IPCC , there are almost only benefits to turning away from coal , oil and gas ?\n\u201d", "author": "P Gosselin",

within hours .\nEarth \u2019 s surface energy imbalance is said to have been positive , +0.6 W/m\u00b2 , during the first decade of this century ( Stephens et al.\n, 2012 ) .\nProblematically , the uncertainty in this assumptive estimation is \u00b117 W/m\u00b2 , which means the imbalance could be anywhere from -16.4 W/m\u00b2 to +17.6 W/m\u00b2 .\nAs Sedlar and colleagues emphasize in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modify the solar and infrared radiation reaching the surface , \u201d and the \u201c net result of these energy fluxes determines the warming and cooling processes at the surface.\n\u201d Quantitatively , shortwave cloud forcing modulates Earth \u2019 s surface radiative flux in magnitudes that vary by \u00b1300 W/m\u00b2 and up to 600 W/m\u00b2 .\n\u201c As clouds typically attenuate shortwave radiation , CRFSW at the surface is negative , resulting in a relative cloud cooling effect ( e.g.\n, Ramanathan et al.\n, 1989 ) .\nThe CRFSW observed for the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from quite strong , \u2212600 W/m\u00b2 , to quite modest near 0 W/m\u00b2 ( Figure 10a ) .\nSubsequently , THFs respond to the modification of SWD by the cloud type .\nUnder low stratiform periods , individual scatter points of Hs + Hl were frequently observed between 0 and 300 W/m\u00b2 and correspond to a median CRFSW ( black square within blue scatter ) approximately \u2212300 W/m\u00b2.\n\u201d Another

remarkable logic : According to this , everything that is burned is part of the recyclable economy , because all that is left is ash , which can even be recycled .\nIt would be the canonization of coal .\nOn the subject of bird strikes , again only one aspect is considered .\nIn this case , a study that is only available as an interim result so far .\nThe study was carried out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money with expertise for the wind power and electricity industry .\nThere is criticism of this study , but nothing of the sort can be found in Rahmstorf \u2019 s selection .\nWe recently reported on a study by researchers from the United Kingdom , who pointed out the risk of birds being killed by wind turbines and power lines .\nAccording to the logic of the study linked to by Rahmstorf , there has

exactly there the researchers determined the largest danger , equally by wind power plants and power lines and not by poisoned rats and mice as the cause .\nRahmstorf also achieves a real feat .\nHe actually blames Fritz Vahrenholt ( who in fact had earlier built up the wind power division for power utility RWE ) for the company \u2019 s CO2 pollution by casually mentioning it in one sentence .\nOne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the RWE wind power subsidiary Innogy .\nRahmstorf rather tries to produce the impression that Vahrenholt personally shoveled the coal into the coal power plants .\nCurrently , RWE is now involved in wind power in a great many countries , including outside Europe .\nJust recently , RWE announced that it would expand its wind power capacity to 50 GW by 2030 , investing 50 billion euros to do so .\nWithout the Vahrenholt \u2019 s early efforts beginning in 2008 , this would hardly have been possible .\nBut differentiating was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nRahmstorf is more interested in

.\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOAA , writes that the AMO can amplify anthropogenic warming in the warm phase and make it disappear in the cold phase .\nAccording to NOAA , the AMO is a naturally occurring

thus contradicting what some climate alarmists claim .\nThese alarmists often rely on cherrypicked data and hope the media will do the rest .\nAnother paper featured by the video is one that appeared in the journal Geophysical Research Letters : \u201c On Timescales and Reversibility of the Ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheet Melting in Comprehensive Climate Models , \u201d authored by Martin et al ( 2022 )

necessarily a tipping point in climate change\u2014AMOC weakening and associated surface cooling reverse to control state within a couple of decades after ceasing of the perturbation , which is about the timescale of their initial response to the FW release.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there will be ice melts of the magnitudes projected by alarmist scientists , let alone a tipping if they did indeed occur .\nTipping points to be viewed with caution Another paper just appeared in the journal Nature Climate Change titled \u201c Freshwater forcing of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation revisited \u201d by Feng He and Peter U.

.\nThe magnitude of freshwater melt over the rest of the current century is projected to be only a tiny fraction of what occurred 12,000 years ago , and so no tipping point can be realistically expected by 2100 .\nNo wonder the authors added : \u201c Any simulated AMOC changes from freshwater forcing should be viewed with caution.\n\u201d Finally , in yet another new publication by Wen et al

the sea surface salinity .\nThe latter enhances the deep-water formation in the subpolar North Atlantic and thus the AMOC.\n\u201d All these findings , and those we reported on 2 days ago , are highly inconvenient for the purveyors of panic climate science .\nThe real science tells that the media , governments and alarmist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of molehills .\nTheir target obviously is to spread panic of

scientists have revisited the requisite conditions for causality in applying the scientific method .\nThey find \u201c the common perception that increasing CO2 causes increased [ temperature ] can be excluded because it violates the necessary condition for this causal direction.\n\u201d In the modern , politically-charged version of climate science there is an emphasis on ( anthropogenic ) attribution and theoretical confirmation from the manufacture of visually-satisfying correlations .\nThe scientific method , in contrast , requires repeated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to construct the theory in question .\nModern climate science often skips this process .\nInstead , there is a presupposition that the determination of causality can be achieved via the construction of a curve-fitted correlation between two variables , then imagining any alternative causal variables can be \u201c ruled out \u201d if and when these alternative curves don \u2019 t align as well as the preferred variables do .\nFor example , if the theory is that polar bears can not survive without thick sea ice in summer , the current emphasis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ populations are declining .\nA declining population trend can then be neatly paired with trends in declining Arctic sea ice , suggesting a causal link .\nThe assumption that polar bears need thick sea ice to catch seals and survive ( even though they may have evolved 4-5 million years ago , or when the Arctic was 22-25\u00b0C warmer-than-today ) is not subjected to falsification .\nIt \u2019 s simply accepted as established truth that sea ice is essential to polar bear survival .\nAnd if anyone disagrees with this presuppositional truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d deluded by misinformation-peddling internet bloggers ( e.g.\n, Harvey et al.\n, 2017 ) .\nTwo companion papers ( Koutsoyiannis et al.\n, 2022 ( 1 ) and Koutsoyiannis et al.\n, 2022 ( 2 ) ) have just been published by scientists from Greece , the UK , and Poland in The Royal Society journal .\nThe first paper describes the flaws with claiming one can establish a causal link by associating trend shape fitment between two events .\nThe authors assert the scientific method requires focusing on the stochastic processes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This allows an observational analysis to falsify assumed causalities that violate essential causal conditions .\nFor example , it is well known physics that causes can not lag effects .\nIf the paleoclimate temperatures began cooling 5,000 years before CO2 concentrations began falling , the decline in the CO2 could not be said to have caused the cooling due to the causality sequencing violation .\nOver the years , there have been many papers published on the question of whether the CO2 concentration drives the modern temperature changes or the temperature changes drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n( 2013 ) indicate that only 10 % of the variance in global CO2 growth rates can be explained by fossil fuel emissions .\nInstead , there is a \u201c strong and persistent coupling ( r\u00b2 \u2248 0.50 ) between interannual variations of the CO2 growth rate and tropical land-surface temperature during 1959-2011.\n\u201d Jones and Cox ( 2005 ) compare the \u201c clear similarity \u201d between the CO2 growth rate anomalies and their correspondence to El Ni\u00f1o events ( warming ) and the negative growth rate anomalies corresponding to La Ni\u00f1a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is \u201c unlikely that these anomalies can be explained by an abrupt increase in anthropogenic emissions , as the anomalies are much larger than the annual increases in fossil fuel emissions.\n\u201d Just how much growth is there in the year-to-year rate of fossil fuel emissions ?\nAs Wang et al .\nnote , often it is only about 0.1 to 0.3 GtC/yr .\nSometimes even less .\n( For example , in the chart below , there was no year-to-year change , and , in fact , a decline , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates from 1980 to 1984 . )\nDr. Jarl Ahlbeck ( 2009 ) assessed these growth rate anomalies were so \u201c clearly insignificant \u201d they could not explain the increase in the atmospheric CO2 composition .\nThus , anthropogenic emissions were omitted from the correlation coefficient equation .\nIn contrast , the temperature \u201c is the dominating variable , and the efficient for the temperature is strongly significant \u201d in explaining the CO2 growth rate anomalies from 1980 to 2008 .\nDr. Humlum and colleagues ( 2013 ) further clarify the sequencing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclude \u201c changes in atmospheric CO2 are not tracking changes in human emissions.\n\u201d They even specify the observed time lag for the T\u2192CO2 sequencing .\nThe CO2 growth rate changes occur 9 months after tropospheric temperature changes and 11-12 months after sea surface temperature changes .\nEven researchers who clearly do not want the observations to show the temperature explaining the majority of CO2 growth rate changes are admitting this is what the data indicate .\nCoulombe and G\u00f6bel ( 2021 ) reluctantly report that global mean surface temperature anomalies \u201c cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a finding that contradicts \u201c common wisdom.\n\u201d The Koutsoyiannis Papers : Temperature As Cause , CO2 An Effect Koutsoyiannis and Kundzewicz ( 2020 ) analyze the sequencing of the changes in CO2 growth rate versus temperature changes using freely-available data .\nThey find that each and every result shows a temperature ( T ) leading CO2 ( T\u2192CO2 ) directionality .\nThe probability values are 100,000 times more likely ( \u201c about 4 to 5 orders of magnitude \u201d ) to be in the T\u2192CO2 direction and not in the CO2\u2192T direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the CO2 values are shown to lag behind T values by about 6 months .\nThe companion paper ( Koutsoyiannis et al.\n, 2022 ( 2 ) ) applying the scientific method to the chicken-or-egg , T-or-CO2 causation question does not support the \u201c common conviction \u201d that human CO2 emissions are driving modern global warming .\nNoting that a causality process requires that causes can not lag effects in sequencing potentialities , the authors suggest there is \u201c a ( mono-directional ) potentially causal system with T as the cause and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The CO2 lag time is about 5-8 months .\n\u201c Hence , the common perception that increasing [ CO2 ] causes increased T can be excluded as it violates the necessary condition for this causality direction.\n\u201d Perhaps the science is not settled after all .\nDr. Koutsoyiannis provided this e-mail summary of the two

latitudes 40\u00b0N to 70\u00b0N ( ) .\nThese values seriously undermine the claim CO2 is the driver of climate change .\nDespite these much higher insolation values , surface temperatures have been estimated to be only a few degrees warmer than today at these latitudes during the Early Holocene .\nAt 77\u00b0N in High Arctic Svalbard , for example , summers were estimated to be 7\u00b0C warmer than today from 10,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher radiative forcing ( van der Bilt et al.\n, 2019 ) .\nSo if an additional 60 W/m\u00b2 radiative forcing only elicits a 7\u00b0C surface temperature change , the effective sensitivity of a 1 W/m\u00b2 perturbation to the surface energy imbalance would be about 0.12\u00b0C .\nThis formula ( 1 W/m\u00b2 produces 0.12\u00b0C surface warming ) has been reproduced by NASA and other scientists using satellite observations .\nFor example , the Mount Pinatubo eruption produced a surface temperature drop of -0.5\u00b0C to -0.6\u00b0C associated with a -4 W/m\u00b2 decline in radiative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nThis is amounts to a 0.12\u00b0C to 0.15\u00b0C temperature sensitivity per W/m\u00b2 .\nOther scientists ( Douglass and Knox , 2005 ) have also computed a \u201c 0.15 \u00b1 0.06 K/ ( W/m\u00b2 ) \u201d radiative forcing-temperature sensitivity .\nAnthropogenic global warming advocates suggest it takes an increase of 22 ppm CO2 ( about 10 years ) to produce a surface forcing change of 0.2 W/m\u00b2 ( Feldman et al.\n, 2015 ) .\nSo , using this formula , it would take 110 ppm ( 40-50 years ) to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis would only produce a temperature change of , at most , 0.15\u00b0C .\nBellamy and Barrett ( 2007 ) have likewise suggested the doubling of CO2 could only represent a temperature change of \u201c 0.6 \u2013 0.8\u00b0C \u201d with the addition of 280 ppm CO2 since the pre-industrial era .\nThis estimate uses the assumption that doubling CO2 produces a 3.7 W/m\u00b2 top-of-atmosphere ( TOA ) forcing .\nDr. Kimoto ( 2015 ) , in contrast , suggests using the the surface radiative forcing value ( 1.1 W/m\u00b2 ) for doubling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the TOA value ( 3.7 W/m\u00b2 ) due to the physical reality of

only yielding a 1.1 W/m\u00b2 surface forcing perturbation to Earth \u2019 s energy imbalance , the climate sensitivity from doubling CO2 from 280 to 560 ppm may only be 0.14 to 0.17\u00b0C In sum ,

\u201d and \u201c can not be attributed to increases in greenhouse gas concentrations.\n\u201d Furthermore , there was a decrease in reflected shortwave radiation ( RSR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 1985 to 1999 , which means there was a +3.6 W/m\u00b2 increase in solar radiation absorbed by the Earth system during these 14 years .\nThis can easily explain the warming during this period .\nCess and Udelhofen ( 2003 ) independently affirmed greenhouse gas forcing could not have been the cause of the 1985-1999 climate changes because the greenhouse effect forcing actually declined during this period .\n\u201c \u2026the negative trend of G [ greenhouse effect anomalies ] indicates that the atmospheric greenhouse effect is temporarily [ 1985-1999 ] decreasing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing.\n\u201d The declining greenhouse effect forcing is consistent with the decreasing trend in cloud cover , which , in turn , may be a manifestation of \u201c internal unforced variability \u201d or \u201c natural variability on decadal time scales.\n\u201d And , as Wang and colleagues also noted , Cess and Udelhofen documented a positive trend in absorbed shortwave radiation ( \u201c ASW \u201d ) from 1985-1999 .\nSong et al .\n( 2016 ) reported then when all greenhouse effect forcing contributors ( CO2 , CH4 , water vapor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d ) there was a declining overall greenhouse effect forcing trend ( shown in red ) from 2003-2014 .\nThe increasing trend in greenhouse effect forcing is only realized in an imaginary world with only anthropogenic greenhouse gas forcing ( CO2 , CH4 ) and no clouds ( \u201c clear-sky \u201d ) .\nAnd , once again , the \u201c dominant contributor \u201d to the greenhouse effect forcing \u201c hiatus \u201d was the cloud cover variation .\nLoeb and colleagues ( 2021 ) determined the ( uncertain ) positive trend in Earth \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2005 to 2019 , 0.5 W/m\u00b2 \u00b10.47 W/m\u00b2 per decade\u22121 , is \u201c primarily due to an increase in absorbed solar radiation associated with decreased reflection by clouds.\n\u201d CERES satellite data indicate clouds and surface albedo account for 89 % of the absorbed solar radiation trend in the 21st century , whereas anthropogenic greenhouse gases account for but a tiny fraction of the trends in combined absorbed solar radiation and greenhouse effect forcing ( reductions in emitted thermal radiation ) during this period .\nThis very small human emissions/greenhouse gas impact is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( \u201c trace gases \u201d ) bars in the graph below .\nIn emitted thermal radiation , graph ( e ) shows the greenhouse gas impact is effectively offset by the cloud influence ; both factors are cancelled out by temperature changes .\nThis leaves the increase in absorbed solar radiation shown in graph ( d ) due to natural variations in clouds and surface albedo ( SFC ) as the primary driver ( s ) of top-of-atmosphere ( TOA ) flux forcing during the last two decades .\nOther scientists ( D\u00fcbal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concluded that the positive TOA net flux ( +1.42 W/m\u00b2 ) from increasing downwelling shortwave ( SW ) facilitated by a drop in cloudiness has been the \u201c major driving effect , \u201d \u201c dominating influence , \u201d and \u201c major heating cause \u201d explaining the 2001-2019 ocean heat content increase ( 240 ZJ ) .\nThe authors note these CERES satellite observations \u201c conflict with the assumption further global warming originates mainly from the LW [ longwave ] radiation capture caused by greenhouse gases , i.e.\n, a decline in outgoing LW.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientists have determined , the LW or greenhouse effect impact has been negative in the 21st century ; it has contributed a net cooling influence ( -1.1 W/m\u00b2 ) over the last two decades .\nThese studies are further supported by a geoscientist ( Swift , 2018 ) , who documented there has been a \u201c decreasing greenhouse factor \u201d or a weakening of the greenhouse effect since 1979 .\nIn contrast , the \u201c increasing absorbed solar radiation , caused by a lowering of the bond [ cloud ] albedo , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the period

.\nDefinitions are often based on a combination of percentile-based thresholds ( e.g .\n98th percentile of daily maximum values and a minimum duration e.g .\n3 days ) .\nThe following heat wave definition is used in the production of the \u201c Climate Maps of Heat Waves \u201d in the German Weather Service : Individually for each grid point , a threshold value for each day \u2013 corresponding to the 98th percentile \u2013 is calculated from the daily temperature maxima of the reference period ( 1961-1990 ) .\nTo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1961-1990 ) , the 15 days before and after the date are also used , which increases the database to 930 values and also results in smoothing .\nIf the current grid values of the temperature maximum are above this climate threshold and above 28 \u00b0C for 3 consecutive days or more , a heat wave is present for the marked area and period .\nHeat waves pose a major risk to health , especially for the elderly and sick .\nFor this reason , the German Weather Service uses its heat warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thermal stress on the basis of the felt temperature and a simulation model to calculate the heat stress indoors.\n\u201d It \u2019 s not clear when the DWD changed to this new , low-bar definition .\nThe World Meteorological Organization defines a heat wave as five or more consecutive days of prolonged heat in which the daily maximum temperature is higher than the average maximum temperature by 5\u00b0C ( 9\u00b0F ) or more .\nBut for the DWD , a regular warm summer weekend \u2013 when it \u2019 s just barely warm enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 now qualifies as \u201c unusually high thermal stress \u201d .\nResult : the media play along and keep reporting on \u201c another heat wave \u201d almost on weekly basis .\nIf we take Berlin and apply the DWD \u2019 s new definition for the year 1992 , for example , Germany \u2019 s capital in fact saw 7 heat waves that summer : May 21-23 , June 2-5 , June 27 \u2013 July 1 , July 8-10 , July 19-21 , July 30 \u2013 August 3 and August 5-10 .\nYet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the media with news of heat waves .\nBack then it was : it \u2019 s summer , stupid !\nAnd note how the DWD uses the ancient 1961-1990 reference period for comparison , a time when the mean temps were about a degree lower and all the talk was about global cooling and the next ice age .\nThis is the trick used to justify 28\u00b0C as \u201c unusually high thermal stress \u201d .\nNever mind that days with highs in the upper 20s often come with nights with temps in mid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnecdotally , this year I can say it \u2019 s been a warm and pleasant summer here in northwestern Germany ; it was certainly too dry .\nBut I didn \u2019 t think it was \u201c a scorcher \u201d because so many evenings were too cool to sit outside without a jacket .\nMoreover , there was not a single night that I found it to be difficult to sleep .\nAnd during earlier hot German summers , I remember having the electric fan running in the office for days .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once .\nIt \u2019 s a bit like the WHO changing its definition of a \u201c pandemic \u201d so that authorities are now able to declare a crisis anytime a grippe breaks out .", "author": "P Gosselin", "url":

obtained precisely reliable temperature measurements as they pulled wooden or canvas buckets out of the water from ships at random depths , locations , and times of day .\nThey didn \u2019 t .\nIt has long been known that pulling a bucket out of the water from a ship is rooted in serious error , rendering the sea surface temperature ( SST ) data obtained nearly useless .\nAshford ( 1948 ) summarized some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this method of measurement .\n\u2022 The initial temperature of the bucket is generally different from that of the sea .\n\u2022 The water in the bucket may change its temperature before the reading is taken owing to the processes of heat exchange and evaporation .\n\u2022 The initial temperature of the thermometer is generally different from that of the sample .\n\u2022 The thermometer is liable to scale errors .\n\u2022 Owing to thermal lag , the thermometer may take an appreciable time to indicate the true temperature of the sample .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bucket when taking the reading , it may no longer indicate the true water temperature .\n\u2022 The temperature may be read incorrectly .\nThere are \u201c pervasive systematic observational errors \u201d associated with using buckets that \u201c affect the whole observational system and change over time \u201d ( Kennedy , 2014 ) .\nThe data collection errors in even one measurement from one location are much larger than the alleged long-term tenths-of-a-degree \u201c global \u201d SST changes over decades .\n\u201c A single SST measurement from a ship has typical combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 K to 1.5 K. \u201d In the ocean , water temperature varies by multiple degrees according to depth , as there are \u201c measurable temperature gradients within the depth range of ship SST measurements \u201d ( Kennedy , 2014 ) .\nThe temperature at 1 meter depth could be 2\u00b0C warmer than the temperature at 10 meters .\nThere was no uniform systematic method governing how deep the buckets needed to be as they were lowered into the ocean .\nWhen pulling the bucket out of the water , there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway , as it was all mixed together as the bucket was lifted to the surface .\nTo control for depth variations , sailors would have needed to regularly measure near-surface waters at a range of depths at specific times of the day and evening .\nThey didn \u2019 t do this , of course .\nOver the span of just 10 to 12 hours the temperature of near-surface sea water can vary by 5\u00b0C ( Kawai and Wada , 2007 ) due to the degree of sunshine duration and intensity ( clear-sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , SSTs can change by as much as 8\u00b0C within hours , depending on the time of day ( Randall et al.\n, 2020 ) .\nTherefore , to accurately record SST measurements requires obtaining maximum and minimum temperature readings .\nThis would mean sailors needed to be lowering buckets into the water at uniform and standardized times of the day , or perpetually measuring temperatures throughout the day and night to control for diurnal variability .\nThey didn \u2019 t do this , of course .\nPerhaps the most underreported problem with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades has been the ridiculously non-global nature of the coverage .\nMost pre-1970s SST measurements came from coastal waters in the North Atlantic , Mediterranean , and Indian Oceans .\nPer Folland and Parker ( 1995 ) , there has long been \u201c sparse coverage of the Pacific , \u201d and \u201c even in recent decades [ 1970s and 1980s ] , the Southern Ocean south of 45\u00b0S is largely missing.\n\u201d If we have \u201c largely missing \u201d SST data from 45\u00b0S to the coasts of Antarctica up until the 1980s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pre-1980s global temperature record , as this represents nearly 20 % of the Earth \u2019 s surface .\nAnd because the coverage is so poor , the utilization of modeled interpolations of what the SSTs might have been has become the accepted standard in temperature derivation .\nIn 5\u00b0 grid boxes , for example , monthly anomalies have been found to be \u201c differing by more than 2.25 degC from the averages of surrounding values , \u201d and \u201c biases occasionally exceed 1 degC in individual months \u201d ( Folland and Parker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anomalies are \u201c replaced by values interpolated from surrounding squares and from adjacent months.\n\u201d So they \u2019 re not actual measurements of SST , but interpolations of what they might have been using modeled assumptions .\nNOAA \u2019 s Thomas Karl experienced some notoriety a few years ago as the author of a \u201c pause-buster \u201d paper because he replaced buoy data ( that showed little warming ) with \u201c unreliable data from ship intakes \u201d so as to eliminate the problematic global warming hiatus .\nBut back in 1989 , Karl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global warming from 1921 to 1979 , but that there are \u201c large geographic areas of the oceans that have not been adequately sampled \u201d ( Karl et al.\n, 1989 ) , especially the tropical Pacific and south of 40\u00b0S .\nSpecifically , for every year from about 1850 to 1950 , under 10 % of the global ocean \u2019 s 2\u00b0 grid boxes averaged 10 or more sea surface observations ( from pulling buckets out of the water ) per month .\nThat \u2019 s the extent of the instrumental \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Earth \u2019 s surface .\nGiven the pervasive systematic errors , depth temperature variability , diurnal temperature variability , need for modeled interpolations , and shamefully poor non-global sampling coverage associated with sailors pulling buckets out of the water at random times of the day or night in the derivation of a \u201c global \u201d sea surface temperature record , it \u2019 s not surprising that temperature data set overseers privately admit to one another that SST data are \u201c mostly made up .\n\u201d", "author": "Kenneth Richard", "url":

Ocean dipole ( IOD ) and southern annular mode ( SAM ) .\nThe authors describe how La Ni\u00f1a facilitates local precipitation generation whereas El Ni\u00f1os are associated with below average

show host Sandra Maischberger interviewed climate activist Greta Thunberg in her native Sweden .\nThe interview aired on Wednesday .\nMany climate policy critics see Greta Thunberg ( 19 ) as a puppet of interest groups who can \u2019 t possibly have any motivation of her own due to her young age and lack of education .\nIt is noticeable , however , that she occasionally makes recommendations that can generate downright hatred , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fridays for Future circles .\nIn 2019 , Greta already classified nuclear power as a \u201c small part of a big new carbon-free energy solution \u201d \u2013 even citing publications from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .\nShe was harshly criticized for this and avoided the topic for three years .\nSince the Greens began in the mid-1970s as scattered citizens \u2019 initiatives against nuclear power plants \u2013 which only later also turned to various aspects of nature conservation \u2013 energy generation from nuclear fission has become considered as a high-risk technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bourgeois circles .\nThe fact that the civilian use of nuclear power has resulted in far fewer deaths and injuries than , for example , modern traffic or conventional power generation , is often overlooked or deliberately not communicated .\nThe factual situation therefore no longer plays a role here , but only its political usability .\nNevertheless , Thunberg has ventured forth once again with the topic of nuclear power \u2013 albeit cautiously \u2013 and compares it to coal power , which is also maligned .\nIn words : \u201c If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already running , I think it would be a mistake to shut them down and turn to coal.\n\u201d In FfF circles , this can already be called courageous because Greta \u2019 s popularity is especially large in the rich and populous German-speaking countries where a green-loaded media landscape made Thunberg \u2019 s idol figure possible in the first place .\nNext to Stockholm , Berlin is her main field of activity and here she is always received effusively and with much attention .\nFrom the point of view of the inclined EIKE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course at best pragmatic over the short-term , yet it does not show an attitude favorable to a sustainable economic and social welfare development .\nHowever , since Brussels redefined nuclear power as a \u201c green \u201d technology months ago , it can be assumed that increasingly parts of the FfF movement are also losing interest in the German government \u2019 s misguided energy policy .\nPerhaps in the near future Greta will already recommend the inherently safe new breeder and DFR reactor types , which already theoretically can no longer be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anointed as an expert without any objective reason is now being questioned from the point of view of nuclear power despisers .\nSome in Berlin are trying to denigrate her view .\nThe taz points to approval of Greta \u2019 s remark by the CDU conservatives and the FDP free democrats .\nIn addition , lobbyists such as the brother of Eckart von Hirschhausen or Armin Simon are quoted : \u201c Greta Thunberg is mistaken when she implies that nuclear power plants could help in dealing with the current gas crisis.\n\u201d ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an instrument of climate policy \u201d , ( Hirschhausen , Scientists for Future ) .\nCompletely wrong \u2013 the more nuclear power plants are on the grid , the more electricity there is , and the cheaper the energy is , which is old familiar market logic .\nAnd if there is more electric power , less gas has to be burned to generate it , which benefits the bankruptcy-threatened metal and food industries .\nHirschhausen is an economist and thus , in contrast to Greta , an expert .\nHow can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree knows more about economics than the economics professor ?", "author": "P Gosselin", "url":

overtaken by much more radical groups who have given themselves frightening names such as \u201c Extinction Rebellion \u201d or \u201c Last Generation \u201d .\nInstead of taking to the streets simply placards and banners , these \u201c activists \u201d are swarming out in small groups armed with superglue , mashed potatoes or tomato soup .\nTheir intention is to break the law in spectacular ways , without regard for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nTheir indiscriminate attacks have targeted airports , artworks , museums , offices or the premises of ministries or administrations .\nBut their favorite tactic is causing traffic jams by gluing themselves to the asphalt , forcing people to lose time and money or to even miss cancer treatments , court hearings and police deadlines for probation exemptions .\nIn one recent case in Berlin , such a blockade had fatal consequences .\nAfter an accident , emergency rescue services could not reach a woman who had been caught under a truck in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before she died .\nNotwithstanding such events , the people causing the mayhem have shown no remorse and maintain that climate change dangers are so urgent that they are mandated to take action no matter how severely they interfere with other people \u2019 s lives .\nPanic-driven defiance of democracy and the rule of law Interestingly enough , quite a number of them are not typical troublemakers or hooligans , but rather ordinary citizens .\nA typical example is a grey-haired , 54-year-old married mother of two , working part-time for a minimal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet .\nAfter travelling several hundred kilometers to glue herself on the asphalt in Berlin , she was arrested and recently put behind bars for the first time in her life .\nFar from being repentant , she read a long , well-prepared statement pleading for the judge to disregard the law and let her go without fine .\nIn her view , she acted in despair , driven by the imminent danger the current human-induced climate change posed for mankind and the planet .\nFighting against this disaster would justify carrying on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after receiving her verdict , she made it clear that the penalty would not deter her from continuing to undertake such actions \u2013 unless society acts against climate change .\n\u201c The whole earth is on fire .\nWe are the first generation to start feeling the coming climate collapse and the last to still have a chance of doing something against it , \u201d the woman claimed .\nThis mass phenomenon underscores how fear of an allegedly imminent climate disaster has been whipped up to such an extent that we are currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are now prepared to abandon any respect for democracy and the rule of law if the rest of society is not willing to align with their views .\nIn other words , a rising fascism masked by the friendly faces of neighbors and sport club mates .\nMeanwhile , even some Catholic priests are joining these glue-ins .\nNormally , one would expect that in the exclusive world of high-level natural sciences , the involved experts would be restrained , well-tempered characters hardly inclined towards extremist views of societal issues .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rayleigh , Nils Bohr , Pierre and Marie Curie or Johannes van der Waals .\nBut these times seem to be long gone .\nIf we look at what Swiss Professor Reto Knutti , atmosphere physicist at the renowned University ETH Z\u00fcrich , he told the highly circulated tabloid \u201c Sonntagszeitung \u201d in an interview published on October 30 , 2022 , that the four main environmental threats are mankind , which is : This remark lays bare a shocking mindset of one of the most prominent European and international experts of climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political institutions and academic circles , Knutti is a frequent interview partner for the media .\nHe contributed to IPCC publications since 2001 and has been one of the lead authors of the IPCC Assessment Reports number 5 and 6 .\nHis H-index in the scientific world is 87 , a value only attainable by \u201c unparalleled personalities \u201d .\nNot even Stalinist leaders admitted to rejecting humanity This statement from such a prominent person is really breathtaking .\nIt might be difficult to find any politician or scientist of comparable significance who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning mankind as a whole .\nNeither fascist nor Stalinist leaders admitted to rejecting humanity in total , rather pretending to support \u201c the masses \u201d against a minority of oppressors .\nIn stark contrast , the \u201c green \u201d philosophy is fundamentally different in that is does not intend to lift humanity out of poverty .\nRather it focuses on impoverishing it , preaching austerity and renunciation , stopping growth and the creation of wealth \u2013 at least for the masses .\nSo no wonder Reto Knutti advocates harsh measures against citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will of the individual , people should be forced to renounce the use combustion-engine cars , and to pay much more to fly or to heat with affordable oil or gas .\nNotwithstanding the hardships greens envision for ordinary people , allegedly green-minded entrepreneurs such as Elon Musk , whose high-priced battery electric vehicles are in line with green philosophy , have amassed incredible fortunes in a record time .\nMusk has become one of the richest men in the world , while millions of poor households face grim choices between eating and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not alone .\nWe currently can admire a mass pow-wow of tens of thousands of climate fear spreaders of his caliber in Sharm El Sheikh .\nThe UN Secretary-General does his best to instill fear and panic to countless millions of people with his sayings like : \u201c We \u2019 re full throttle on the highway to hell \u201d .\nUnfortunately , he \u2019 s right , but not because of climate change itself , but rather because of the climate change policies of our governments .\nEurope , hitherto a haven of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiencing double-digit inflation rates , skyrocketing energy prices and a looming tsunami of layoffs and company closures .\nAnd there is little hope that the coming years might bring about any significant relief .\nIn many western countries , the greens have taken control of at least a part of the levers of power und are eager to win control over the rest .\nTheir aim is to exert full power over their citizens .\nExploiting electronic communication is the name of their game .\nWhile complaining loudly about surveillance in China , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ears of Big Brother .\nApp after app is made available with the aim of nudging citizens to carry the device constantly with them as soon as they leave home or office .\nTake a flight ?\nYour boarding card is on your smartphone .\nHave to prove that you received the latest Covid jab ?\nThe document is on your smartphone .\nTrain ticket ?\nOn your smartphone , together with your museum ticket .\nWant to pay cashless in the supermarket ?\nUse your smartphone .\nPay for the parking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to monitor your health and fitness activities ?\nUse your smartphone , of course .\nAnd what does your smartphone do ?\nIt collects and sends everything you do and every place where you go straight to Big Brother .\nOne of the latest trends is to eliminate the use of cash , as one can see taking place in some Scandinavian countries .\nIn the near future , one will not be able to spend the slightest amount of his money without some faceless authority knowing every detail of the transaction : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and what for .\nWith the help of giant Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) computer programs , every aspect of your whereabouts and deeds are processed and a detailed analysis of your preferences and mindset is permanently updated and kept in giant computer memories .\nDo you think China is a surveillance state with all these cameras at every street intersection ?\nThe people in charge of the Chinese secret service would pay handsomely in exchange for the sophisticated AI software and hardware gadgets that their Western counterparts have at their disposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put such instruments to use .\nIn Germany , they are running key ministries such as the foreign ministry and the ministry of economics .\nHave taken over key ministries Another interesting aspect of the greens is their astonishing flexibility with respect to political principles .\nIn their early years , they counted Yassir Arafat among their acquaintances and were foes of the military and especially the NATO alliance .\nHaving morphed into staunch supporters of the latter , green foreign minister Annalena Baerbock and economic minister Robert Habeck did all they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipeline gas in favor of US and Qatari LNG gas with a sixfold higher price .\nAs a result , the German Government has to shell out at least 200 billion euros for this heating period alone to help people over the next cold months .\nBut even this enormous sum is nothing more than a short-term patch aimed at averting immediate revolts .\nWith the relations with Russia in shambles and the 20 billion North Stream pipeline reduced to a heap of rusting scrap on the bottom of the Baltic Sea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population and their industry over the long-term disadvantages resulting from their feud with their key energy supplier ?\nDuring an interview , Annalena Baerbock gave an answer highlighting her disdain for her own population when she told journalists that she would maintain her political course \u201c no matter what my German voters think \u201d .\nAny questions about the mindset of these \u201c saviours of the planet \u201d ?\nAs a result of skyrocketing energy prices , German aluminum smelters are currently experiencing a 25 % loss in sales .\nAnd don \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger grows .\nIn stark contrast to the swift retreat of Liz Truss when she realized the swing in public mood after her gaffes , German greens can be expected to stay glued to their political posts , come hell or high water .\nNo matter what my German voters think", "author": "P Gosselin", "url":

past decades .\nLo and behold , now the models are finally seeing wintry weather for next weekend .\nIn his latest forecast , Joe has become \u201c very concerned \u201d about the coming cold , which

drum-up for the big Jamboree of climate fanatics in Sharm el Sheikh a few weeks ago , politicians , NGO \u2019 s and the mainstream media have done their best to mask an inconvenient truth that will preoccupy us for a long time to come : the massive recession that the climate policies in our countries have brought upon us .\nThis undeniable truth can be clearly seen when looking at the Nasdaq , a fairly good gauge for the state of the economy and the seriousness of recessive developments : The graph shown above may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital patient .\nIt is a fairly good indicator of the current state of the economy reflecting ups and downs and their severity .\nFor the past 17 years , several minor disturbances aside , we can identify three major setbacks linked to specific events .\nTheir severity can not be deducted directly by comparing the absolute differences .\nThis is due to the fact that over time , the Nasdaq is subjected to constant growth as a result of the upswing in the collective wealth of the US shareholders .\nIt is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such declines by calculating the relative difference between max- und min-value before and respectively after the event .\nThis yields the following results : The last two positions on the list should be viewed as a cluster where , especially in the second phase , aspects of energy/economy and war have become inextricably intertwined .\nThis cluster has up to now achieved a combined value reduction of the Nasdaq of up to 36 % , by far the strongest decline of the past two decades .\nUnfortunately , it is also the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a conflict with an intensity not seen for several decades .\nFar from being over , it has the potential to drive us into a full-blown world war with a nuclear superpower , with possible consequences far beyond the imagination of most people now living in our countries .\nUnfortunately , the main driving force of this cluster has now shifted from the economy to the military theatre , with a spiral of tit for tat provocations drawing the participants ever deeper into a quagmire with no end in sight .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of Nato-driven modernisation of the Ukrainian army , has in the meantime been digging in its heels and has managed to stop the Ukrainian counter-offensive , with horrible losses on either side .\nBoth these developments have left their mark on the Nasdaq in the form of short-lived bear market rallies : Fig .\n2 .\nThe ups and downs of the Ukraine war have left their mark on the Nasdaq chart .\nThe obvious consequence of this war is the aggravation of an already dire situation initially brought about by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Nasdaq chart since November 21 , three months before the Ukrainian conflict broke out .\nThe underlying reason is the West \u2019 s policy of punishing companies exploring for and extracting fossil fuels by restricting their access to the financial market .\nThe resulting shortage of coal , oil and natural gas inevitably resulted in skyrocketing prices for these assets , with companies and states frantically trying to secure their supplies of these vital energy sources .\nNo wonder thus that these prices literally exploded when the West decided to boycott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuels .\nBut not for long .\nIn the meantime the prices have shown deep declines not only for oil and gas , but also for most mineral commodities .\nThe reason for this puzzling trend , at first glance , is that the related markets now seem to expect a long and severe recession .\nReduced industrial activity implies reduced demand for all sort of commodities , and these expectations have dragged the prices down .\nThe gravity of the situation is highlighted by the fact that even a noticeable production reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from falling below the mark of 80 US $ per barrel .\nThis combination of a misguided energy policy and a war , which shows no sign of abating anytime soon , is a toxic mixture that may threaten all of us .\nLooking at the military side , Russia has been able to stop the recent advance of the NATO-backed Ukrainian army .\nThe current situation reminds the frozen frontlines of the first World War , with massive artillery duels and fierce disputes over trenches that endlessly changed hands .\nSome sources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1,000 killed or severely wounded soldiers per day , a rate the country might not be able to sustain forever .\nIn spite of this fact , the West has opted to entrust the decision over peace or war to the Ukrainian leader , whose preconditions for peace talks amount to demanding an unconditional surrender of Russia .\nSome regard him as a fanatic wanting to fight to the bitter end .\nAnd we have vowed support , \u201c whatever it takes \u201d .\nIn

sinking billions into senseless \u201c climate-saving \u201d investments that are nothing else than \u201c instant \u201d stranded assets .\nAnd worse still : unfazed by the decline in share value

"================================ Dear Ladies and Gentlemen The most exciting question in terms of energy policy in the coming months is just how intense is the winter going to be .\nThe German DWD Weather Service reassured the German government and public in November : \u201c The German Weather Service \u2019 s winter forecast is good news for all energy consumers .\nWe expect a comparatively mild winter .\nIf the model proves to be right , we will be able to save heating energy as a result.\n\u201d That sounds like governmental whistling in the woods by now , because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ECMWF ( European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ) predict a sharp cooling by the 4th of Advent ( see below the forecast for the 4th Advent , source : Kachelmannwetter.com ) .\nThe graphs above show the cold weather extending from Poland to northern France .\nFrance \u2019 s electricity consumption , a significant portion of which is used for heating , has a major impact on electricity supply and electricity prices in Germany in the absence of sufficient nuclear capacity .\nFor those who want further daily information , please refer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warming page .\nGlobally , the indices also show no warming ( Dr. Roy Spence ) .\nThe deviation of the global temperature from the 30-year average of the satellite-based measurements of the University of Alabama ( UAH ) has decreased from 0.32 degrees to 0.17 degrees Celsius in November 2022 compared to October .\nThe average temperature increase per decade since 1979 is still 0.13 degrees Celsius \u2013 no indication of a worrying or even catastrophic trend .\nOn the contrary : sea ice extent in the Arctic has increased again since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been declining slightly .\nHow long will the stored gas last ?\n\u201c The availability of energy for electrical power generation is assured for this winter , \u201d said German Economics Minister Robert Habeck , Green Party , at a press conference in South Africa on the security of electricity supply in Germany .\nBut if we analyze where the electricity is coming from in Germany these days , it is anything but reassuring .\nIn the diagram below , we see the power generation since December 1st .\nSolar energy has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a persistent lull .\nAs of 3 p.m. on Dec. 10 , 60 gigawatts of electricity were being consumed .\nSolar ( light yellow ) supplied 0.7 GW , wind onshore ( light green ) 1 GW , offshore ( grayish green ) 1.6 GW , natural gas ( light brown ) 16 GW , coal ( dark brown ) 12 GW , and lignite ( medium brown ) 14.6 GW .\nHow can Germany go without coal , nuclear ?\nEven nuclear power ( red ) , which is in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GW , more than solar and wind power combined .\nHow should Germany be supplied in such situations , if in 2024 the added coal and lignite power plants have will all have been taken off the grid and the nuclear power plants have already been switched off in April 2023 ?\nEnergy plan means \u201c electricity prices will continue to go through the roof \u201d Look below at the light brown area in the graph of electricity from natural gas , the most expensive power generation with the scarcest energy we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to additionally replace the dark brown and medium brown areas of lignite and hard coal and the red areas of nuclear energy , then we already know today that electricity prices will continue to go through the roof .\nThe current coalition government would not survive that .\nEven a moderately cold winter presents the government with barely solvable problems .\nThe storage facilities are already emptying at a rate of 0.5 % per day .\nAnyone can calculate how long storage facilities , which are 94 % full ( Dec. 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the federal government \u2019 s specifications , should still have a 40 % storage level in February , will last if the cold continues .\nIt may just be fine with luck .\nBut what will happen next winter ?\nIn view of this state of affairs , how can the Chancellor roundly reject the extraction of gas from shale rock ?\nQuote : \u201c Investments in German shale gas production would hardly be worthwhile because it would take too long to use domestic sources \u2013 by then gas demand will have decreased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this statement : it is economically worthwhile because it would be 1 . )\nmuch cheaper than US fracking LNG gas , 2 . )\nit would also take only one year until the first gas could flow ( which would be the case now if the German government had acted responsibly ) and 3 . )\ngas demand will by no means decrease .\nThree mistakes in one sentence with fatal consequences for Germany as a business location is not something you hear every day from a German chancellor .\nAfter a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an oil shortage Before the Ukraine war , Russian oil covered 35 % of the oil needed in this country .\nAlthough there is still no European import ban on pipeline oil , Economics Minister Habeck had promised the EU that as of January 1st , no more oil would be sourced via the Druzhba pipeline , which supplies the Schwedt and Leuna sites .\nThe alternative supplies via Rostock or Gdansk will only cover part of the pipeline imports .\nPoliticians are keeping silent on the price .\nAdded to this are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : oil supplier Russia is to be paid only $ 60 per barrel of oil , although the world market price is significantly higher .\nPutin has already stated that Russia will not supply on these terms .\nNow there are two possible consequences of the EU decision .\nRussia has already acquired a shadow fleet of 100 tankers to transport its oil to other regions .\nIf Russia succeeds in placing all its oil with other market participants such as India or China , this would have few consequences for all market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has so far imported cheap pipeline oil from Russia .\nHowever , if Russia does not succeed in placing all its oil , there would be too little oil on the world market .\nOPEC+ has already announced that it will not increase oil production .\nIn this case , oil prices would rise while demand would remain the same worldwide .\nSuch a boycott would probably be called a knee-jerk reaction .\nWith best wishes for a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year Yours , Fritz Vahrenholt", "author": "P Gosselin", "url":
