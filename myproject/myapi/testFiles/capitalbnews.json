is talking to newsmakers from across the country who want to reshape American politics or galvanize Black voices in government .\nOur \u201c Voices of Change \u201d series will update periodically with insights from the candidates , activists , lawmakers , and political insiders who you should know .\nJecorey Arthur expected much more pushback from other legislators when he assumed office in 2021 as the youngest councilmember in Louisville , Kentucky \u2019 s history .\nThe activist , then 28 , called for radical solutions to poverty , gentrification and systemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been fatally shot by police the year before .\nBuoyed by a wave of voters who were politically activated by the 2020 protests against police brutality , the former music teacher also campaigned on the need for reparations for American descendants of slaves .\nHe told the Courier Journal that we wanted to \u201c fix Black Louisville \u201d when he decided to run .\n\u201c To a certain extent they thought I was just going to come in and whip out a flame thrower and burn everything down , \u201d Arthur , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c But I \u2019 m not naive enough to believe that I alone , by myself , can burn everything down .\nIt \u2019 s going to take community.\n\u201d During his first year in office , Arthur says he \u2019 s been able to push through most of the legislation he sponsored \u2013 38 of 40 bills , resolutions and proposed funds .\nThe council approved a resolution to study and develop a proposal for reparations for descendants of slaves and an ordinance that provides city-funded legal representation to families facing eviction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplishments , but disappointed that so much of the energy for radical change that elected him to office in 2020 has dissipated .\n\u201c Now , here I am in office , and sometimes I feel like I \u2019 m up there all alone , \u201d he said .\nCapital B spoke to Arthur about his first year in office , the legislation he has passed , and how the political landscape has changed locally since he was elected .\nThe interview is edited for clarity and length .\nCapital B : When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you didn \u2019 t want to run for office , in large part because this was not how you saw yourself as most effective .\nYou only ran because others asked you to .\nHow do you feel about that decision now ?\nJecorey Arthur : I typically say awful .\nAnd then they laugh .\nAnd they think that I \u2019 m joking , but I \u2019 m not .\nIt \u2019 s hard to even put into words how complex it is to be a legislator .\nI \u2019 ll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislator , especially a Black legislator .\nIt \u2019 s our job to not only write laws , but to rewrite laws , as in correct them .\nI \u2019 m in office , and people look to me as this savior or this superhero that \u2019 s supposed to come no matter what the issue is , no matter if it \u2019 s within the scope of being a legislator or not .\nIt \u2019 s something that I \u2019 m supposed to address .\nAnd I think that we as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don \u2019 t count on that elected official , that legislator , to stay in their lane , they can \u2019 t do their job , which is to legislate .\nThe majority of the time when people call me or when people check in with me or when people have any request for me , it \u2019 s not anchored in legislation .\nIt \u2019 s anchored in a very narrow issue that only impacts them and that they think I have immediate solutions for .\nThe legislative process is not immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was tricked into believing that without fully understanding the ins and outs of local government .\nBut now I \u2019 m realizing how slow it is and how complex it is .\nAnd then , when you add elections into the mix , it gets even worse because people are scared to move forward on things .\nIt \u2019 s just so much more than people understand .\nYou campaigned on pushing against poverty and gentrification .\nHow has that gone so far ?\nLast year , our first year in office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI \u2019 m proud that 38 of those 40 pieces of legislation passed .\nI won \u2019 t give you the full list of the 38 , but [ they were ] very , very much anchored in abolishing poverty .\nWe passed the reparations resolution that went to the desk of President Joseph Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris , all of our congressional leadership , as well as our state governor and federal elected officials that are in Washington who represent Kentucky .\nThey received this reparations resolution that really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal reparations program for Black American descendants of slavery .\nWe also passed a homeless hate crime , so that anyone who is unhoused in our city is a protected class in the same way that race is a protected class , the same way that your sexual orientation is a protected class , the same way that other protected classes work with the federal hate crime law .\nWe added unhoused people to that , because we have had a number of vicious attacks .\nIn some cases , even murder has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down encampments , people are throwing bricks at encampments , people harassing folks .\nAnd so we added that to our code to protect them .\nWe also passed , the CROWN Act banning discrimination against natural hair .\nWe passed a safety zone ordinance , so that people could get access to health care .\nThere were a number of women being harassed going in and out of Kentucky \u2019 s one and only abortion clinic .\nWe passed a right-to-counsel so that families with children , if they were going through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal representation .\nHow was holding office compared to your expectations ?\nHow much change were you able to affect on the issues you campaigned on ?\nI actually expected a lot more pushback on some of what I was trying to introduce .\nI expected a lot more adversity .\nNow in some cases , like any changes with policing , I \u2019 ve gotten pushback all day long , especially considering we \u2019 re coming up on midterms .\nHalf of our council districts are up for reelection .\nOverwhelmingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , Democrats are trying to swat away the \u2018 defund the police \u2019 phrase and [ to ] signal to their base , both Democrats and Republicans , that we support police .\nBut other than that , I have gotten overwhelming support with things that we \u2019 ve introduced and fought for .\nI mean , the fact that we passed 38 out of the 40 pieces of legislation that we sponsored , I think that \u2019 s kind of surprising because I was almost looked at like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s loud , he \u2019 s an activist .\nTo a certain extent , they thought I was just going to come in and whip out a flame thrower and burn everything down .\nBut I \u2019 m not naive enough to believe that I alone , by myself , can burn everything down .\nIt \u2019 s going to take community .\nYou were part of a progressive blue wave that swept local elections .\nHow has the political landscape changed , if at all ?\nI would say I \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy from 2020 has largely died down , largely went back dormant .\nI \u2019 m shocked because I felt like 2020 was such an awakening .\n[ It was ] such a moment for people .\nAnd now , here I am in office , and sometimes I feel like I \u2019 m up there all alone .\nAnd I don \u2019 t mean all alone , literally .\nI mean I just feel like there \u2019 s a minimal amount of people who are engaged in the work that we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re trying to make .\nWhereas , in 2020 , I felt like there was an army .\nAnd now it \u2019 s very much dwindled down , in our district , in our city , in our state , and our whole country .\nI think it \u2019 s an issue everywhere .\nAnd it \u2019 s , it \u2019 s kind of sad for me to hear , because I was just campaigning throughout 2020 .\nI remember very vividly having conversations with voters .\n[ They would say ] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrat , I \u2019 ll vote for you \u2019 or \u2018 you \u2019 re black , I will vote for you.\n\u2019 And we would say : \u2018 Absolutely not .\nListen to what our campaign says .\nThe skin color in the box next to my name does not matter .\nListen to these policies.\n\u2019 I felt like we had some teachable moments with folks then .\nAnd now they \u2019 ve kind of like , resorted back to voting blue no matter who .\nNow , they resorted back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies .\nWhat do you think is needed to energize Black residents to vote ?\nI think that people have to have intrinsic motivation .\nOftentimes , I hear a politician or a candidate talking about getting people excited and energized and motivated .\nAbsolutely .\nYou need to do your job as a candidate or as a legislator to have policies to pass them , to make people motivated .\nBut on the flip side , the citizenry absolutely has to have intrinsic motivation from within .\nThey have to motivate themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s a two way street .\nAnd people fail to realize that what I have passed , everything that I just shared with you , was done with community .\nI would have never passed that all by myself , introducing legislation and just arguing and yelling at other council members .\nI had to build coalitions of thousands of people across this city to engage in the process somehow , whether that \u2019 s calling your elected official , or signing a petition , or doing some sort of direct action .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd I think that level of being organized is not something that we \u2019 re totally used to .\nWe \u2019 re used to just pointing fingers at other people and saying it \u2019 s on them when the reality is on all of us .\nWhat do you see as the biggest challenges for progressive politicians going forward ?\nI think that the biggest hurdle that we will have is to get our people organized so that we can actually pass legislation .\nAnd that \u2019 s really all it takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an example , all of these \u2018 critical race theory \u2019 bills that are passing : do you know how much strategy went into getting middle-class and upper-class conservative white folks upset about critical race theory and not even realizing that what you \u2019 re upset about is not real and it doesn \u2019 t exist in our public school system ?\nThat was an intentional strategy .\nAnd I \u2019 m failing to see some intentional strategy with some of our Democrats across this country [ or ] with some of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think the hardest part for me moving forward , and for any elected official moving forward , is getting people to practice politics .\nCorrection : Jecorey Arthur \u2019 s district includes the home of Breonna Taylor \u2019 s ex-boyfriend , which police also raided in 2020 ; it does not include the home

"COVID-19 Remains the Great Unequalizer", "content": "Soon after the coronavirus arrived in the United States , the racial inequities of its devastating toll became apparent : Black people were dying at twice the rate of whites .\nThe data shocked some Americans .\nOthers panicked .\nThe role that race and ethnicity play in Americans \u2019 health outcomes became headline news as the numbers were broadcast across the country .\nBut as we enter the third year of the coronavirus pandemic , little has changed .\nDisparities in severe COVID-19 complications linger .\nBlack Americans \u2019 chances of dying from the virus are still double that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly three times as likely to be hospitalized , according to February data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .\nNot only that .\nPublic concern about the disproportionate toll of the virus has diminished .\nRace and ethnicity data that is publicly reported has dwindled , making it difficult for researchers to identify and address disparities .\nAnd of the few efforts that have been made to target COVID \u2019 s racial inequities , some have received swift and forceful backlash .\nOn the positive side , racial gaps in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks have rolled up their sleeves for a shot .\nBut among those who are vaccinated , the limited data still shows striking inequities in outcomes .\n\u201c Even that tool is not enough to address the negative impacts of structural racism , \u201d said Oni Blackstock , founder and executive director of Health Justice , a consultancy that focuses on reducing health inequities .\nBlack Americans have recorded more than 4.7 million COVID-19 infections and over 88,000 deaths nationwide since the beginning of the pandemic .\nThose numbers are likely an underestimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a significant portion of COVID data .\nPublic health experts hoped the documented disparities would push American health systems to address the inequities baked into the institutions .\n\u201c When health equity came to light in the pandemic , I was excited but I was also biting my tongue , \u201d said Dr. Panagis Galiatsatos , a critical care specialist and assistant professor at Johns Hopkins Medicine .\nNearly two years later , he \u2019 s frustrated by the lack of action in curbing the vast racial differences in COVID outcomes .\nHealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a permanent seat at the table , \u201d he said .\n\u201c We need true movement.\n\u201d While the problems have been identified , movement has been minimal .\nSoon after entering office , President Joe Biden created the COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force , which found that half of nationally reported data on COVID cases and deaths still do not identify the person \u2019 s race .\nFederally run vaccination sites popped up in vulnerable communities , but the number of doses administered was a small fraction of the total supply .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ early on to work with churches to ensure Black communities were supported in fighting the effects of COVID-19 .\nBut in a \u200b\u200brecent letter , a group of Black pastors said the state is \u201c failing to reach Florida \u2019 s communities of color and its most vulnerable.\n\u201d The severity of COVID-19 racial disparities mirrors inequities that have been persistent in American medicine for decades .\nData suggests that in addition to age , certain chronic conditions \u2014 such as hypertension , heart disease , diabetes and cancer \u2014 make patients more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black Americans are often at higher risk for those illnesses than white Americans because of factors like unequal access to nutritious food and quality health care .\nThe stress of exposure to racism , which has a weathering effect on the body , compounds the disparities .\n\u201c An airborne virus in some ways is a great equalizer , \u201d said Galiatsatos , noting the ease of transmissibility .\nBut , he added , \u201c community dictates your health more than anything else.\n\u201d Experts who have studied such disparities hoped the spotlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American health system would inspire new approaches to tackling health disparities \u2014 tactics that take the whole patient into consideration and that recognize the impacts of stress and racism on the body .\n\u201c Just treating one patient \u2019 s blood pressure was not going to stop a community from getting completely sidelined by the pandemic , \u201d said Dr. Utibe R. Essien , an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh .\n\u201c How are we using the disparities in the pandemic to help create a more equitable health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll out in December 2020 , structural barriers such as inability to take time off from work and skepticism of the government-backed health institutions promoting injections \u2013 a fear rooted in the country \u2019 s long-standing history of medical racism \u2013 created another racial gap .\nOver time , the gap between vaccinated Black and white Americans has decreased , CDC data shows , a trend likely driven by grassroots efforts to dispel misinformation and get vaccines into vulnerable neighborhoods .\nAmid discussions about returning to life as \u201c normal , \u201d much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrapping mask mandates hasn \u2019 t accounted for the needs of people with different resources , said Blackstock , a primary care and HIV physician .\nThose with the privilege of working from home , sufficient child care and adequate health insurance are being prioritized , she said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not really including an equity lens or considering more vulnerable communities , \u201d she said .\nThe pandemic and the racial justice protests of 2020 shifted American attitudes toward the institutional racism within the health care system \u2014 but only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nonprofit research institution , showed that public acknowledgement of the role systemic inequities play in health outcomes increased around December 2020 , said Anita Chandra , a senior policy analyst at RAND .\nBut over time , that acknowledgement began to fade .\nAbout two-thirds of respondents agreed that people of color were disproportionately burdened by the health and financial impacts of the virus .\nBy September 2021 , that proportion decreased to about one-half .\nRespondents were also more likely to recognize social and economic inequities than racial ones .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty narrow , \u201d Chandra said .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve got more of an uphill climb than people think.\n\u201d As the highly contagious omicron variant surged , public health officials recommended doctors consider a patient \u2019 s race and ethnicity , in addition to their underlying conditions , when allocating the life-saving treatments , such as monoclonal antibodies and oral antiviral drugs .\nThe move , experts say , is a nudge towards ensuring patients had equal access to the therapies .\nAn analysis by the CDC published in January showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the virus were less likely than white people to receive monoclonal antibody treatment .\nIn December , the state of New York published guidelines for administering the treatments , noting that COVID-19 patients should be eligible if they \u201c have a medical condition or other factors that increase their risk for severe illness.\n\u201d It adds that \u201c Nonwhite race or Hispanic/Latino ethnicity should be considered a risk factor , as long-standing systemic health and social inequities have contributed to an increased risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19.\n\u201d The U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendation .\nBut some conservative lawmakers oppose such a protocol , saying it discriminates against white patients \u2013 though there is no evidence treatment for white people has been delayed or denied .\nNew York State faces a federal lawsuit filed by America First Legal , a conservative law organization , which says the recommendation is \u201c racist and unconstitutional.\n\u201d Amid the backlash , Minnesota and Utah have since dropped their policies .\nRace is not the only factor that the guidelines recommend providers take into account .\nOthers include age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment within five days of the first symptoms .\nBecause Black patients have a higher likelihood of being exposed to COVID-19 , said Dr. Essien of the University of Pittsburgh , \u201c we need to really increase their exposure to treatments as well.\n\u201d Those studying covid-19 \u2019 s racial disparities say having standardized data collection across states \u2013 particularly for vaccinations \u2013 is crucial to accurately measuring the impact of the pandemic and ensuring equitable distribution of vaccines .\nFor a third of covid-19 cases , the race and ethnicity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CDC , suggesting estimates may be inaccurate .\n\u201c That has really been a barrier to getting a comprehensive full picture of how the pandemic is affecting different communities , \u201d said Blackstock of Health Justice .\nThe amount of publicly available data varies across states and jurisdictions , so does its level of completeness .\nFor vaccinations , the race data comes from patient questionnaires .\nBut how states collect and report the data varies , and people can opt not to indicate their race on the form .\nAs of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported vaccination data by race and ethnicity for children .\nEven then , how the data is reported varies by state , making it hard to compare .\nKing County in Seattle has become a model for vaccination data collection , comprehensively reporting and publishing its numbers by demographics .\nThe weekly updated report makes it easy for public health officials to identify gaps and expand vaccination efforts in communities where vaccine uptake is lagging .\nFactors like ability to take paid time off of work to rest after getting a shot remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widespread availability of vaccines has made getting vaccinated easier than ever before , said Dr. Essien .\nTo combat some of the structural issues , community health centers have played an active role in increasing vaccination rates in Black communities , he said .\n\u201c When you actually give people the resources , the tools , the information that they need to be able to get this life-saving therapy , \u201d he said , \u201c they are going to get it .\n\u201d", "author": "Margo Snipe", "url": "https://capitalbnews.org/covid-black-health-equity/", "published": "Fri, 04 Feb 2022 15:51:37 +0000", "published_utc": 1644007897,

Wade .\nThe interview has been edited for length and clarity .\nCapital B : Democrats hoped the voting rights bill would pass ahead of the midterms .\nThat has not happened .\nWhat is needed to ensure Black voters have the turnout , the motivation to participate in the midterm elections without these hoped-for protections ?\nLaphonza Butler : First and foremost , organizations like EMILY \u2019 s List , candidates and campaigns have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monolith .\nThere is not a single thing that is the magic bullet .\nFrom a candidate perspective , it \u2019 s being able to speak to the issues that are most important and relevant to those voters in that district .\nYes , the voting rights legislation is a setback , but in my history and experience of working in communities all across the country \u2013 where Black voters live and work every day \u2013 is that the setbacks are just that : They are setbacks and not the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midterm elections , we \u2019 ve got to see the Black community as committed Democratic voters who are not monolithic , who want to be spoken to authentically and met where they are on the issues that are important to them .\nWe \u2019 ve got to talk about what we are for and not focus on the setbacks .\nWe need to make sure we \u2019 re telling communities where our candidates are intending to take the country moving forward .\nThe magic of being a successful elected official is care and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about why it is that you are engaging in public service .\n[ Activists ] have already demonstrated the care : They care about their communities , they care about what needs to be changed in their communities or in their districts .\nWhat we want to do at EMILY \u2019 s List is to make sure that we \u2019 re able to help those activists be seen as qualified candidates for public service .\nWe work with them to make sure that they are ready to turn those activist skills to securing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following them in a picket line or in a march , to following them into public office and casting their ballot for them .\nWe help them build sophisticated campaigns to communicate effectively .\nThey know their districts , so we \u2019 re able to talk to them about communities to target and messages to speak with those communities .\nBut our job as we see it is to help support the inherent skills of the activist and help her turn those activist skills into skills that will translate into votes .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those early resources , so that people in the community have confidence that she is not only an activist but capable of putting together the kind of resources to win and make a difference .\nIt \u2019 s clear that part of what spurred so much support for these activists-turned-politicians was the fear that came out of the Trump years .\nHow do those efforts that you \u2019 re making change to make sure that the motivation of that period for Democrats does not die down ?\nWhat we experienced at EMILY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elections was more than 60,000 women reached out to us from all over the country and wanted to offer themselves for public service .\nFrom a tactical point , we have created online communities for them to connect with each other , we have offered online training and made it accessible no matter what community that person is reaching out to us from , we have made sure that we are working to expand the state and local work of EMILY \u2019 s List .\nIn the past , our top focus has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continue the momentum of women wanting to run for office \u2013 and the diversity of women that want to run for office \u2013 we \u2019 re making sure we have the organizational infrastructure , a programmatic focus to support them in their elections on a state and local level , which we see as so important to playing defense as well as offense on a policy perspective heading into these midterms .\nSo the increased scale of women that we saw who wanted to run for office in 2016 has informed how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s List available and accessible to women all over the country , no matter what office they are running for .\nI was raised in a small town in Mississippi .\nI went to a historically Black college .\nI spent the first 20 years of my professional career working for working men and women in the labor movement of all backgrounds .\nSo I bring those kinds of real-people experiences to an organization that already has an incredibly rich 40-year history of promoting and supporting women who want to run for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color have faced barriers in terms of fundraising .\nWe have to be an organization that is dedicated not just to equality in terms of how we support our candidates , but dedicated to equity .\nOur candidates don \u2019 t all start from the same line or network in terms of their access to resources .\nSo , first , making sure that our candidates from all kinds of backgrounds know that there is value in their network , and making sure that they are asking their network .\nAnd then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s List has built over their 40-year history and making sure they \u2019 re able to connect with those supporters and those donors .\nI hope that my presence as the leader of EMILY \u2019 s List is a source of inspiration for a candidate that is thinking to herself that maybe she doesn \u2019 t belong , that maybe her journey isn \u2019 t what it takes to be an elected official .\nPresence and representation matters and it doesn \u2019 t go out of style .\nSo making sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrating that representation is part of how we are communicating that everyone can belong at an organization like EMILY \u2019 s List .\nWhen Black women show up at the ballot box , or when Black women show up at the PTA , or when Black women show up at their church meeting , it is not just for themselves .\nWhat makes our participation so powerful is that we bring along the desires of our children , we bring along the dreams of our cousins , we bring along the pain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps us showing up and what keeps us in the journey to justice is that we know that \u2013 but for our engagement \u2013 our neighbor \u2019 s pain may not have a place .\nBut for our showing up , our children \u2019 s dreams might be deferred .\nWe absolutely are a demographic in this country who has experienced oppression and have been so critical in liberation , that we won \u2019 t give up .\nThe journey to justice , the destination is where we \u2019 re really trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Black women participation in South Carolina when Joe Biden \u2019 s presidential race was indeed on the ropes .\nLook at what happened in the election of Sens .\n[ Raphael ] Warnock and [ Jon ] Ossoff in Georgia when the Democratic majority [ in Congress ] was indeed on the ropes .\nLook at what happened when George Floyd lay dying on the streets of Minnesota : Look who took the video , look who testified , look who led the marches .\nIt is our resilience and commitment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the people around us .\nOur whole community is why we keep showing up .\nWe \u2019 ve got ta roll up our sleeves and do the work .\nIn a time when our nation and the globe is facing a pandemic the likes of which we haven \u2019 t seen in a generation \u2013 we can \u2019 t stop working to ensure an equitable recovery , getting federal dollars invested locally .\nThese are not easy challenges to resolve .\nTo assume any voter can break through the challenges of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remotely , not knowing when or if your child is going to be able to go to school and stay in school , not knowing what the challenges are going to be around the corner , we can \u2019 t leave any vote or take any vote for granted .\nIn my experience , candidates who are able to build the deepest relationship of trust are the candidates that are most likely to be successful .\nAnd we have to make sure that we communicate that we are still fighting .\nDespite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And frankly rejecting this language of failure .\nWe are in some of the biggest global challenges that our generation has ever seen , and despite that , there are changes that are being made , there are laws that are being passed .\nNot at the pace that any of us would have wanted , but the way we actually get to that pace and the way that we actually build momentum is to continue to stay engaged , to continue to go to that ballot box , to continue to offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be a part of the change that we want to create .",

these figures on your shoulders just waiting to get something out of you , \u201d said Payne , a high school junior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote learning , the trauma of the 2020 murder of George Floyd and the turmoil of the uprisings that followed , Payne said the school police only intensified the students \u2019 anxieties rather than calmed them .\nAfter witnessing what she calls unfair backpack

School District to withdraw all funding for school police and divert it to mental health support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students , we literally had to sit back and watch the entire world debate whether or not our lives actually mattered , \u201d said Simya Smith,16 , a member of Students Deserve .\nAfter a yearlong outcry from students and community members , the LA school board in February 2021 approved a plan to cut $ 25 million \u2013 a third of the school police budget \u2013 and shift those funds into a $ 36.5 million initiative called the Black Student Achievement Plan .\nThe mission is to support

coaches help de-escalate conflicts and provide social and emotional support for struggling students .\nThe district said the coaches would be residents from the communities that their schools serve .\nThe restorative justice advisers help shift the schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reconciliation to address conflict and crime .\nPayne and Smith say they haven \u2019 t seen any police officers at Dorsey this school year and have seen huge improvements since the mental health staff arrived .\nThey feel relaxed .\nThe counselors talk to them about Black trauma and politics in ways that make them feel

.\nLocal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be more equipped to provide guidance , they say , since they have more than 20 years of data and research compiled on police departments statewide .\nAfter eight days of

galvanize Black voices in government .\nOur \u201c Voices of Change \u201d series will update periodically with insights from the candidates , activists , lawmakers , and political insiders who you should know .\nJecorey Arthur expected much more pushback from other legislators when he assumed office in 2021 as the youngest councilmember in Louisville , Kentucky \u2019 s history .\nThe activist , then 28 , called for radical solutions to poverty , gentrification and systemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been fatally shot by police the year before .\nBuoyed by a wave of voters who were politically activated by the 2020 protests against police brutality , the former music teacher also campaigned on the need for reparations for American descendants of slaves .\nHe told the Courier Journal that we wanted to \u201c fix Black Louisville \u201d when he decided to run .\n\u201c To a certain extent they thought I was just going to come in and whip out a flame thrower and burn everything down , \u201d Arthur , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c But I \u2019 m not naive enough to believe that I alone , by myself , can burn everything down .\nIt \u2019 s going to take community.\n\u201d During his first year in office , Arthur says he \u2019 s been able to push through most of the legislation he sponsored \u2013 38 of 40 bills , resolutions and proposed funds .\nThe council approved a resolution to study and develop a proposal for reparations for descendants of slaves and an ordinance that provides city-funded legal representation to families facing eviction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplishments , but disappointed that so much of the energy for radical change that elected him to office in 2020 has dissipated .\n\u201c Now , here I am in office , and sometimes I feel like I \u2019 m up there all alone , \u201d he said .\nCapital B spoke to Arthur about his first year in office , the legislation he has passed , and how the political landscape has changed locally since he was elected .\nThe interview is edited for clarity and length .\nCapital B : When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you didn \u2019 t want to run for office , in large part because this was not how you saw yourself as most effective .\nYou only ran because others asked you to .\nHow do you feel about that decision now ?\nJecorey Arthur : I typically say awful .\nAnd then they laugh .\nAnd they think that I \u2019 m joking , but I \u2019 m not .\nIt \u2019 s hard to even put into words how complex it is to be a legislator .\nI \u2019 ll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislator , especially a Black legislator .\nIt \u2019 s our job to not only write laws , but to rewrite laws , as in correct them .\nI \u2019 m in office , and people look to me as this savior or this superhero that \u2019 s supposed to come no matter what the issue is , no matter if it \u2019 s within the scope of being a legislator or not .\nIt \u2019 s something that I \u2019 m supposed to address .\nAnd I think that we as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don \u2019 t count on that elected official , that legislator , to stay in their lane , they can \u2019 t do their job , which is to legislate .\nThe majority of the time when people call me or when people check in with me or when people have any request for me , it \u2019 s not anchored in legislation .\nIt \u2019 s anchored in a very narrow issue that only impacts them and that they think I have immediate solutions for .\nThe legislative process is not immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was tricked into believing that without fully understanding the ins and outs of local government .\nBut now I \u2019 m realizing how slow it is and how complex it is .\nAnd then , when you add elections into the mix , it gets even worse because people are scared to move forward on things .\nIt \u2019 s just so much more than people understand .\nYou campaigned on pushing against poverty and gentrification .\nHow has that gone so far ?\nLast year , our first year in office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI \u2019 m proud that 38 of those 40 pieces of legislation passed .\nI won \u2019 t give you the full list of the 38 , but [ they were ] very , very much anchored in abolishing poverty .\nWe passed the reparations resolution that went to the desk of President Joseph Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris , all of our congressional leadership , as well as our state governor and federal elected officials that are in Washington who represent Kentucky .\nThey received this reparations resolution that really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal reparations program for Black American descendants of slavery .\nWe also passed a homeless hate crime , so that anyone who is unhoused in our city is a protected class in the same way that race is a protected class , the same way that your sexual orientation is a protected class , the same way that other protected classes work with the federal hate crime law .\nWe added unhoused people to that , because we have had a number of vicious attacks .\nIn some cases , even murder has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down encampments , people are throwing bricks at encampments , people harassing folks .\nAnd so we added that to our code to protect them .\nWe also passed , the CROWN Act banning discrimination against natural hair .\nWe passed a safety zone ordinance , so that people could get access to health care .\nThere were a number of women being harassed going in and out of Kentucky \u2019 s one and only abortion clinic .\nWe passed a right-to-counsel so that families with children , if they were going through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal representation .\nHow was holding office compared to your expectations ?\nHow much change were you able to affect on the issues you campaigned on ?\nI actually expected a lot more pushback on some of what I was trying to introduce .\nI expected a lot more adversity .\nNow in some cases , like any changes with policing , I \u2019 ve gotten pushback all day long , especially considering we \u2019 re coming up on midterms .\nHalf of our council districts are up for reelection .\nOverwhelmingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , Democrats are trying to swat away the \u2018 defund the police \u2019 phrase and [ to ] signal to their base , both Democrats and Republicans , that we support police .\nBut other than that , I have gotten overwhelming support with things that we \u2019 ve introduced and fought for .\nI mean , the fact that we passed 38 out of the 40 pieces of legislation that we sponsored , I think that \u2019 s kind of surprising because I was almost looked at like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s loud , he \u2019 s an activist .\nTo a certain extent , they thought I was just going to come in and whip out a flame thrower and burn everything down .\nBut I \u2019 m not naive enough to believe that I alone , by myself , can burn everything down .\nIt \u2019 s going to take community .\nYou were part of a progressive blue wave that swept local elections .\nHow has the political landscape changed , if at all ?\nI would say I \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy from 2020 has largely died down , largely went back dormant .\nI \u2019 m shocked because I felt like 2020 was such an awakening .\n[ It was ] such a moment for people .\nAnd now , here I am in office , and sometimes I feel like I \u2019 m up there all alone .\nAnd I don \u2019 t mean all alone , literally .\nI mean I just feel like there \u2019 s a minimal amount of people who are engaged in the work that we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re trying to make .\nWhereas , in 2020 , I felt like there was an army .\nAnd now it \u2019 s very much dwindled down , in our district , in our city , in our state , and our whole country .\nI think it \u2019 s an issue everywhere .\nAnd it \u2019 s , it \u2019 s kind of sad for me to hear , because I was just campaigning throughout 2020 .\nI remember very vividly having conversations with voters .\n[ They would say ] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrat , I \u2019 ll vote for you \u2019 or \u2018 you \u2019 re black , I will vote for you.\n\u2019 And we would say : \u2018 Absolutely not .\nListen to what our campaign says .\nThe skin color in the box next to my name does not matter .\nListen to these policies.\n\u2019 I felt like we had some teachable moments with folks then .\nAnd now they \u2019 ve kind of like , resorted back to voting blue no matter who .\nNow , they resorted back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies .\nWhat do you think is needed to energize Black residents to vote ?\nI think that people have to have intrinsic motivation .\nOftentimes , I hear a politician or a candidate talking about getting people excited and energized and motivated .\nAbsolutely .\nYou need to do your job as a candidate or as a legislator to have policies to pass them , to make people motivated .\nBut on the flip side , the citizenry absolutely has to have intrinsic motivation from within .\nThey have to motivate themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s a two way street .\nAnd people fail to realize that what I have passed , everything that I just shared with you , was done with community .\nI would have never passed that all by myself , introducing legislation and just arguing and yelling at other council members .\nI had to build coalitions of thousands of people across this city to engage in the process somehow , whether that \u2019 s calling your elected official , or signing a petition , or doing some sort of direct action .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd I think that level of being organized is not something that we \u2019 re totally used to .\nWe \u2019 re used to just pointing fingers at other people and saying it \u2019 s on them when the reality is on all of us .\nWhat do you see as the biggest challenges for progressive politicians going forward ?\nI think that the biggest hurdle that we will have is to get our people organized so that we can actually pass legislation .\nAnd that \u2019 s really all it takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an example , all of these \u2018 critical race theory \u2019 bills that are passing : do you know how much strategy went into getting middle-class and upper-class conservative white folks upset about critical race theory and not even realizing that what you \u2019 re upset about is not real and it doesn \u2019 t exist in our public school system ?\nThat was an intentional strategy .\nAnd I \u2019 m failing to see some intentional strategy with some of our Democrats across this country [ or ] with some of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think the hardest part for me moving forward , and for any elected official moving forward , is getting people to practice politics .\nCorrection : Jecorey Arthur \u2019 s district

face disproportionately high rates of poor health outcomes across most illnesses : diabetes , hypertension , heart disease , asthma \u2013 to name a few .\nFor most cancers , Black Americans \u2019 death rates are higher than other racial groups and their survival rates are shorter .\nBlack men have the highest rates of prostate and colorectal cancer compared to other racial groups , and the number of patients under age 50 is rising .\nBlack women are more likely than white women to die of breast cancer despite being diagnosed at similar rates .\nAnd during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women in the U.S. is comparable to developing countries despite technology advancements .\nThese health disparities linger because of structural racism embedded within the health care system and in the environments where people live , work , play , and worship .\nThe issue was thrust to the forefront of health discussions as the COVID-19 pandemic turned the nation \u2019 s attention toward the disproportionate toll of the virus \u2014 and other chronic illnesses \u2014 on Black America .\nSince then , the inequities reported in coronavirus-related hospitalizations , deaths , and vaccination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the meaning behind \u201c health equity \u201d \u2014 the idea that everyone should have a fair opportunity to live a healthy life .\n\u201c Health equity is achieved when every person has the opportunity to attain his or her full health potential and no one is disadvantaged from achieving this potential because of social position or other socially determined circumstances , \u201d according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .\nHealth experts and local organizers are working to better understand and remove the barriers to equitable health outcomes .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in life expectancy , rates of disease , severity of illness and death show that health equity is more of an ideal than an accomplished goal in medicine .\n\u201c Health is much more than medical care , \u201d said Dr. Carla Williams , an associate professor of Medicine and Public Health at Howard University .\n\u201c We have to talk about our neighborhoods , environmental factors , such as exposure to toxins , and even the education system.\n\u201d Inequities in health and wellness are largely caused by the systems that affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences .\nGenes don \u2019 t cause racial disparities \u2013 society does .\nThat means many of the documented racial disparities are preventable , and thorough research and comprehensive policy changes are powerful tools in improving outcomes for Black Americans .\nThe concept of health equity has international roots based in social medicine .\nIn 1946 , the World Health Organization wrote the concept into its constitution .\nThe \u201c highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race , religion , political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d the constitution reads .\nThe intention behind health equity was \u2014 and still is \u2014 to eliminate avoidable differences in health outcomes .\nThe Heckler Report \u2013 released in 1985 by a task force commissioned by Secretary of Health and Human Services Margaret Heckler \u2013 marked the first time the U.S. government officially convened health experts to study racial and ethnic minority health .\nIt captured a snapshot of health disparities across the nation .\nSince then , research conducted around equity in medicine has expanded , offering health experts a deeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by race .\nTo address the disparities , making a distinction between \u201c equity \u201d and \u201c equality \u201d is key .\nEquality focuses on giving everyone the same access to care , while equity varies resources based on individual needs .\nEquity takes into account that more vulnerable communities have additional barriers to being healthy and provides them with more support than in communities with greater resources .\nEquality would give all patients equal access to cancer screenings .\nEquity would focus on factors that influence a patient \u2019 s ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as insurance , ability to fund treatment , safe and reliable transport to get to appointments , and obstacles like cultural stigmas or language barriers .\n\u201c The starting point has to be fair and reasonable , \u201d Williams said .\nEquity aims to remove systematic barriers and create an equal opportunity to be healthy regardless of race , gender , or socioeconomic status .\n\u201c We have to make adjustments and provide different resources for different individuals and groups based on their personalized needs , \u201d she said .\nTo get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influencing people \u2019 s health , you have to look outside of traditional medical institutions , said Natasha Williams , an associate professor of population health at New York University .\nCircumstances like availability of affordable housing and health foods , exposure to violence or toxic waste , and access to safe , open-air parks affect people \u2019 s well-being .\n\u201c The day to day , constant experience of discrimination , or even the threat of discrimination , will impact your physical and mental health , \u201d said Williams .\nThat added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heart rates , and it can disturb sleep .\nThese stress factors , which encompass the ways people interact with their environment and community , are referred to as social determinants of health .\nThe racism and unconscious bias baked into traditional medical institutions further compounds the inequities outside of the healthcare system .\nDismissing Black patients \u2019 pain is one of the ways bias impacts care .\nResearchers found that Black emergency room patients were 40 % less likely to receive pain medication than white patients , according to a 2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients falling victim to the coronavirus rapidly grew during the pandemic , many health equity researchers pivoted from their career-long specialties in areas like cancer research and maternal health to investigate COVID-19 .\nThe virus was a perfect , real-time example of how complex and deeply entrenched health inequities are across the country .\nBlack Americans remain twice as likely to die from the coronavirus \u2014 a trend driven by disparities in pre-existing conditions and an enduring lack of resources in communities most vulnerable to disaster or disease outbreaks .\nAs Americans consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal \u201d looks like as caseloads of the omicron variant drop , public health and medical experts are studying the best ways to protect Black communities from continuing to bear the brunt of devastating health outcomes .\nThey are pointing to policy changes and increased accountability for ensuring equitable health outcomes .\nDecisions like where to place crosswalks , the density of fast-food restaurants in a community , school policies for subsidized meals , and zoning laws for housing , all factor into health equity .\n\u201c All of these are policy decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the health of a community or an individual for better or worse , \u201d Alden Matthew Landry , the assistant dean for diversity at Harvard Medical School , wrote in an email .\nSome national legislation passed in recent years adds a layer of accountability for

groups to take part in clinical trials .\nTo do so , it requires that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by underrepresented groups in government-funded cancer research trials .\nThe bill was inspired by Lacks , a Black woman whose cells were used for research without her consent in the 1950s .\nHealth equity efforts require information and discussion about how race affects Americans \u2019 experiences in various parts of their lives \u2013 an awareness that is being squashed in statehouses across the country .\n\u201c Policy can be a double-edged sword , \u201d said Alicia Best , an assistant professor in the University of South Florida \u2019 s College of Public Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move to restrict teaching about race in schools .\nFlorida Gov .\nRon DeSantis has backed a bill that would bar public schools and private businesses from making people feel \u201c discomfort \u201d about history because of their race , nationality or gender .\nHe has also proposed a Stop WOKE Act , which aims to limit education on critical race theory .\nIt \u2019 s part of a wave of similar legislation across the country , including in Texas and South Dakota .\n\u201c This kind of legislation undermines the ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMany experts blame the structural racism ingrained in various aspects of daily life for the persisting inequities in Black Americans \u2019 life expectancy , rates of disease and death , and access to treatment .\nAnother factor in those persistent inequities is limited access to race and ethnicity data .\nIn nearly half of the nationally reported data on coronavirus cases and hospitalizations , race and ethnicity is missing , according to a report by the federal COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force , making it difficult for researchers to identify inequities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across health data beyond the coronavirus .\n\u201c If you don \u2019 t collect simple demographic information in a way that recognizes diversity , \u201d said Williams , the Howard professor , \u201c you are going to cause people to be invisible and you \u2019 re not going to know where those inequities and disparities exist.\n\u201d Inclusive data collection that allows individuals to report preferred language , migration history , ethnicity , disabilities , and gender identity is essential to identifying barriers to equitable health outcomes , she said .\n\u201c The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far is that there \u2019 s a recognition that we need to address systemic issues , \u201d she said , \u201c but we \u2019 ve still got work to do in actually remedying them

divided racial justice advocates who debate whether the health benefits would come at the risk of further criminalizing Black communities .\nThe FDA gave itself until April to draw up rules that limit the sale of menthol cigarettes , which are easier to smoke and harder to quit than unflavored products .\nThe tobacco industry \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward Black Americans for decades .\nToday , 85 %

tobacco .\nSome Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on grounds that making menthol cigarettes illegal will give police more opportunities to detain Black Americans , who are already overly burdened by the legal

Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act banned flavors in cigarettes \u2014 except menthol .\nThen , in 2011 , the FDA \u2019 s Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee , which evaluates the safety of tobacco products , released a report that said banning menthol would have significant public health benefits , and an internal report in 2013 recommended the same .\nIn 2020 , organizations including the American Medical Association and the National Medical Association joined a lawsuit against the FDA stating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health duties by failing to ban menthol .\nMonths later , the agency announced it would draft a proposed ban , and in January the FDA said it was on track to advance two proposals : One bans menthol in cigarettes and another prohibits most flavored cigars

was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2020 .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a set up.\n\u201d Similarly , the tobacco industry also sponsored Pride festivals and gay nights at bars , which has increased menthol use within the LGBTQ community .\nFor folks who live at the intersection of multiple marginalized identities , like Black queer people , the likelihood of smoking menthol increases .\nMenthol masks unpleasant tobacco flavors , making smoking less harsh , especially for first-time users , doctors say .\nIt gives smokers the illusion that it \u2019 s not as toxic as other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences are just as severe \u2014 if not worse .\n\u201c It increases the likelihood of people becoming addicted and the degree of addiction , \u201d said Dr. Jamie Rutland , a pulmonary and critical care physician .\nMenthol cigarette smokers remain at risk for emphysema , chronic bronchitis , asthma and lung cancer , which Black men are already at high risk for .\nAnd the highly addictive nature of menthol is

being a Black journalist can inform your work : Gillian White : A question that I \u2019 ve gotten asked before , and I \u2019 m sure you \u2019 ve heard a million times , is , \u201c Why does having Black journalists , as opposed to other journalists , matter when it comes to coverage ?\nWhy does it matter what race they are versus just someone who \u2019 s a good journalist ?\n\u201d And I wonder how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kevin : Look \u2013 we were born Black .\nI grew up in all-Black communities and there \u2019 s something about that .\nI know everybody \u2019 s had different experiences and so we all are different , right ?\nBut there is something that connects us .\nWhen you walk past Black people \u2026 that nod .\nI was down in Hawaii , in Maui , you see each other , there \u2019 s a connection that even if we don \u2019 t know each other , we probably have some shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a family .\nAnd that does inform your practice of this craft , right ?\nAnd how you see what you see .\nAnd I think it \u2019 s always , you can be Black in many different ways but being Black is part of what you can bring to a story and to how a story is framed and shaped , and what stories you choose to tell .\nThe Big Interview : Creating Your Own Lane Tyler Perry sat down with Capital B Atlanta Editor Gavin Godfrey , and shared how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspired the hub now known as Tyler Perry Studios : \u201c When I got here , [ Atlanta was ] the first place I ever saw Black people do well , \u201d Perry said .\nHe was there to party with friends , and the wheels started turning in his head .\n\u201c I \u2019 m looking around going , \u2018 Whoa , wait a minute .\nBlack people live there \u2026 wait , they \u2019 re going to the movies .\nWait , this restaurant \u2019 s full of Black people .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that in New Orleans unless we were serving , right ?\nSo , and this wasn \u2019 t the \u2019 40s or \u2019 50s , this was the \u2019 90s .\nSo to come [ to Atlanta ] and feel the pulse and the energy of a place where Black people were welcome and not only welcomed to thrive , but they were also running the city .\nAll those things were important to me.\n\u201d Perry also highlighted the need for finding your audience and telling stories that cater to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whatever the niche is .\nSuper serve it .\nSuper serve it .\n\u2026 And I mean uber focus on them and everybody else will come .\nAnd that \u2019 s what I did.\n\u201d Errin Haines , Editor-At-Large and Founding Mother of The 19th* joined co-founder and Chief Audience Officer Akoto Ofori-Atta to discuss the need for newsrooms like The 19th and Capital B. Akoto : I believe last year , Brent Staples wrote about white newspapers \u2019 historical role in fueling racist violence , white supremacy , erasing Black stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many newsrooms have had to atone for their behavior , for their past behavior , right ?\nBut it is really nice to work at a place that has a chance to get it right from the beginning , that baked into its existence is the idea that journalism has failed so many of us for so long , and we are going to start on Day One trying to get that right .\nAnd so , as you sort of charted this path , I \u2019 d love to hear what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newsroom that is fueled with that mission , not just for your work , but I \u2019 m sure it \u2019 s just a thing that sort of drives all of the work that you and your colleagues do .\nErrin : I think that there is absolutely something very exciting about the idea of building culture instead of fixing it , which is what our work is .\nIt \u2019 s hard work , but it \u2019 s very different work , right ?\nWe are building this plane as we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also not throwing the engine out the back and whatever else is not working .\nNo , that stuff , that baggage that exists , frankly , at a lot of legacy mainstream is that makes it very hard to turn those cultures and those institutions around , we are not burdened by that , right ?\nWe bring , certainly , our strong journalism foundations , the best of what we love about journalism , we bring that to this work , while we then try to build on that to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future , the newsroom that we are envisioning more equitable .\nEquity was at the core of The 19th , which I think was so important for us , because like you said , we launched in January 2020 , right ?\nSo five months ahead of the reckoning , we launched .\nBut even a year before that , we were already thinking if we \u2019 re going to start this , we may not even know how to fully get there , but equity is absolutely going to be at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because we know that that is absolutely the center of what \u2019 s missing in mainstream legacy media .\nLauren Williams , Capital B CEO and co-founder , chatted with her sister , Tia Williams , bestselling author of \u201c Seven Days in June , \u201d about their shared desire to tell stories for Black people and the harsh criticism that came with those dreams .\nTia shared that when they were growing up in the 1980s and \u2019 90s , the mainstream media that they consumed was majority white .\nEverything from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she read .\nHer obsession with reading and lack of representation developed into a dream of changing the landscape .\n\u201c I always knew that I wanted to do this , which I know is a rare thing , but I had two big goals : that I was going to work in fashion magazines and kind of change things from the inside because Black beauty editors in the \u2019 90s were not a thing .\nAnd then I also wanted to write fiction for us , write the books that I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I guess that \u2019 s where it all comes from , the lack.\n\u201d Tia shared the harsh realities of writing Black stories and trying to get her books published .\n\u201c Back then it was like , if it \u2019 s not about Black suffering and if characters aren \u2019 t seen through the lens of some sort of oppression porn , having to get over the trauma of Blackness to find happiness it \u2019 s like they didn \u2019 t understand us in any other context .\nAnd so when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write like fun , saucy novels about a young , Black beauty editor , or a Black woman working in fashion , and some of the feedback I would get was actually like , \u2018 Are there even any Black fashion editors ?\n\u2019 Is this even realistic ?\n\u2019 \u201d In a conversation with Morgan Johnson , co-founder of The TRiiBE , actor , writer , director , and showrunner Diallo Riddle talked about the power of authentic storytelling .\nMorgan : What I really love about \u201c South Side \u201d is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translate Blackness for anybody .\nIt is just authentically Black , probably one of the Blackest shows I \u2019 ve ever seen .\nDiallo : Thank you .\nThat means so much .\nMorgan : Very authentically Chicago .\nIt \u2019 s like a big inside joke between Chicagoans that not everyone is going to get .\nDiallo : What we try to do with our show is replicate some of the chaotic , fun silliness of some of our favorite comedies .\nI always say that , you know , \u2019 cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c The Office , \u201d which makes sense \u2019 cause we take place in a workplace and \u201c The Office \u201d is sort of like a workplace comedy , but really what we \u2019 re trying to do is \u201c The Simpsons.\n\u201d On \u201c The Simpsons , \u201d everything that happens in the city of Springfield can pop up on the screen , and so we sort of use the South Side as our Springfield .\nThat \u2019 s why we have like , my character is an alderman .\nWe \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a police officer with his real-life wife , Chandra Russell , who plays Officer Turner .\nWe \u2019 ve got the guys who work at RTO .\nWe \u2019 ve got Chase , the white dude who \u2019 s randomly in the neighborhood .\nWe got Travis , the aspiring rapper .\nWe go out of our way to sort of build a whole universe of characters .\nI mean , I think the first two seasons of the show had something like 170 speaking parts each season .\n\u2026 We just really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build this universe .\nIt \u2019 s building this universe where we can literally pop into any place in the South Side and be confronted with just a really funny character , a funny , unexpected character .\nThese are the colorful characters that when you \u2019 re growing up in these communities , you meet .\nGlory Edim , co-creator of Well-Read Black Girl , talked with author Clint Smith III about the story behind the title of his bestselling book , \u201c How The Word Is Passed.\n\u201d Smith traveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is remembered and discusses how as a country we have and have not reckoned with the legacy of slavery .\n\u201c In The Getting Word Oral History Project , I came across a quote from one of the descendants of someone who was enslaved at Monticello .\nAnd he was talking about the way that he heard the story , learned the story of life in Monticello , from his grandmother who learned it from her grandfather , who learned it from , you know , and that is how it has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is how the word is passed down .\nAnd there are some times when you \u2019 re a writer , when you just like the title , just like , bam , you just see it .\nAnd you \u2019 re like , all right , this is it .\nAnd , I knew as soon as I saw that phrase , how the word is passed , captured so much of what I was trying to excavate in this book .\nAnd so many of the things that I was trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , you don \u2019 t always get the title right on the first time , but I got this one right I think.\n\u201d You can watch the replay of Thursday \u2019 s conversations on our YouTube channel .\nTo keep up with Capital B and join in our events , you can become a member ,

it yesterday .\nIt started with a call from his longtime friend Tracy Martin , who wondered if Horton had heard from Martin \u2019 s son , Trayvon .\nThe 17-year-old had gone to a nearby 7-Eleven in Sanford , Florida , the night before , but when Martin opened his bedroom door to ask if he wanted breakfast , Trayvon wasn \u2019 t there .\nHis bed hadn \u2019 t been slept in .\nHorton , Trayvon \u2019 s former football coach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horton \u2019 s own son hadn \u2019 t spoken to the teen in two days .\nSo Martin filed a missing person report .\n\u201c That \u2019 s when the police came in , \u201d says Horton , 50 .\n\u201c They showed him pictures of Trayvon lying in the middle of the sidewalk.\n\u201d Ashley Gantt remembers the next morning with similar clarity .\nThe young teacher had taken the day off from her job at Miami Carol City High School in Miami Gardens , Florida , and decided to check on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her students , but the response she received wasn \u2019 t the one she expected .\n\u201c You remember that student , Trayvon ?\n\u201d the student texted back .\n\u201c He was killed.\n\u201d Gantt went to her computer to search for news about a fatal shooting near Orlando , where the student said Trayvon had been .\nShe found an article with a simple headline : \u201c Man killed in Sanford.\n\u201d \u201c I know this isn \u2019 t about Trayvon .\nHe \u2019 s a teenager , \u201d she recalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that article was about his murder , but it was.\n\u201d Ten years after Trayvon Martin was killed while walking home from a corner store \u2013 carrying a bag of Skittles and a bottle of Arizona juice \u2013 the details of the aftermath are seared into the memories of those who were among the first to learn of his death : The former coach who cried with his father .\nThe English teacher who comforted his classmates .\nThe students who walked out of his school in protest .\nFor the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a different reason .\nThe elements of Trayvon \u2019 s story that launched a nationwide racial justice movement have replayed over the past decade attached to the names of other Black people killed by police or vigilante violence : Elijah McClain in Aurora , Colorado ; Michael Brown in Ferguson , Missouri ; Tamir Rice in Cleveland , Ohio ; Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge , Louisiana ; Breonna Taylor in Louisville , Kentucky ; and Ahmaud Arbery in Brunswick , Georgia \u2013 to name just a few .\nArbery , 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Trayvon , and the circumstances of their deaths were markedly similar .\nBoth were traveling through familiar residential areas when they were pursued by armed white men who had deputized themselves to seek out burglars .\nBoth cases ended with struggles \u2013 struggles that the Black men lost \u2013 and with the shooters claiming self-defense .\nIn Georgia , the men said they were executing a legal citizen \u2019 s arrest against Arbery .\nIn Florida , authorities said Zimmerman was protected by the state \u2019 s \u201c stand your ground \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizen \u2019 s arrest law .\nFlorida \u2019 s stand your ground statute remains .\nBut the cases ended very differently .\nThe three men involved in Arbery \u2019 s death have received life sentences for his murder , and a federal jury last week convicted them of engaging in a hate crime .\nGeorge Zimmerman , the man who shot Trayvon , was acquitted of murder .\nStill , Trayvon \u2019 s death launched what has been described as the largest social movement in U.S. history .\nThough the phrase \u201c Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coined until after Zimmerman \u2019 s acquittal in 2013 , the protests demanding his arrest began soon after Trayvon \u2019 s killing .\nThe teen \u2019 s classmates walked out of school .\nNew Yorkers held a \u201c Million Hoodie March.\n\u201d And the digital social justice movement dawned : professional athletes , celebrities and politicians posted photos of themselves in hoodies on their social media accounts .\nTen years later , for those who knew Trayvon and saw their private pain turn into a worldwide awakening , a question remains : Has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was clear from the beginning that the official narrative was being crafted against Trayvon .\nAccording to reports at the time , Zimmerman told police that he got out of his vehicle when he saw a person walking and acting suspiciously in the gated community where Zimmerman lived and where Trayvon was visiting his father and his father \u2019 s girlfriend .\nAfter he lost sight of the teen and started walking back to his vehicle , Trayvon emerged from behind and attacked him , pounding Zimmerman \u2019 s head into the cement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar story .\nAnd the same details were leaked to the public .\n\u201c They tried to make it like it \u2019 s self-defense , and we know that \u2019 s not Trayvon , \u201d Horton said .\nHe remembers encouraging the elder Martin to push back against that formulating narrative about his son .\n\u201c You can \u2019 t let it go just like that .\nYou have to fight this , \u201d Horton told his friend .\n\u201c He \u2019 s not that type of kid.\n\u201d People who knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to describe him : easy-going , soft-spoken , smart , kind .\nThat \u2019 s not to say he didn \u2019 t get into trouble , they say , but it was typical teenage stuff .\nThat trouble became a defining part of the early coverage of Trayvon \u2019 s fatal encounter with Zimmerman .\nAs protests calling for Zimmerman \u2019 s arrest expanded across the country in March 2012 , Trayvon \u2019 s school record was leaked to the Miami Herald .\nThe teen had been suspended three times and was serving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed .\nIn one case , a school security staffer wrote that Trayvon had \u201c a burglary tool \u201d in his backpack .\nThe tool was a flathead screwdriver , the Herald reported .\nMonths later , officials caught Trayvon with an empty baggie containing traces of marijuana .\nGantt remembers hearing Trayvon had been suspended and immediately getting angry .\nShe had been his 10th-grade English teacher at Carol City High , a predominately Black school .\nWhen he told her that he was transferring to Dr. Michael M. Krop High \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a larger proportion of white and Hispanic students \u2013 for his junior year , she had mixed feelings .\nKrop was a good school , but she hated to lose a good student .\nGantt didn \u2019 t originally know the reason behind Trayvon \u2019 s suspension .\nNow a criminal defense attorney , the former teacher says Trayvon \u2019 s experience is evidence of the unequal ways Black students are treated at schools where they are not the majority .\n\u201c When it \u2019 s a Black student accused of using marijuana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Gantt , now 36 .\n\u201c But when it \u2019 s a white student , it \u2019 s kids being kids.\n\u201d Trayvon \u2019 s family confirmed the media reports about his suspensions but argued they were irrelevant to what happened the evening of Feb. 26 , 2012 .\nThey noted that Trayvon had no criminal record , a fact that Sanford police refused to confirm publicly .\n\u201c They killed my son and now they are trying to kill his reputation , \u201d Trayvon \u2019 s mother , Sybrina Fulton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zimmerman \u2019 s background began to emerge .\nIn 2005 , he had been charged with assault on a police officer at a bar , several news outlets reported , but he avoided more severe consequences by entering a pre-trial diversion program .\nA girlfriend accused him of domestic violence that year , as well .\nReports also emerged that Zimmerman had called police nearly 50 times since 2004 , largely to report minor concerns like open garage doors and loud music .\nIn the years after Trayvon \u2019 s killing , Zimmerman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though charges were later dropped .\nHe also sued Trayvon \u2019 s parents for defamation and conspiring to have charges filed against him , seeking $ 100 million in damages .\nA judge recently dismissed that case .\n\u201c I knew who this person truly was back then \u2013 a guy with a gun who saw a Black kid walking through a nice neighborhood , \u201d Horton said .\n\u201c He wanted to be known as the guy who stopped an assailant \u2013 a young , Black kid who was up to no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid who was up to nothing.\n\u201d One of Saige Mills \u2019 strongest memories after Trayvon Martin \u2019 s death is of being kicked out of class for goofing off during the moment of silence for his classmate .\nKrop High School had been doing its best to stay out of the rapidly intensifying political firestorm around the death of its new student .\nMills recalls there was a candlelight vigil , and many students wore hoodies in Trayvon \u2019 s memory .\nBut by the time Krop held a moment of silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month after Trayvon was killed , Mills was already disconnected .\n\u201c It was not a thing to me .\nIt happened , but it doesn \u2019 t directly affect me , \u201d said Mills , now 24 and living in Hollywood , Florida .\n\u201c It was the space I had in my privilege.\n\u201d Krop was a diverse school , almost equally divided between white , Black and Hispanic students .\nMills was one of the Black students , and he had shared a Spanish class with Trayvon .\nHe remembers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quintessential cool , Black kid , \u201d often seen with his hoodie and headphones .\nHe also remembers the implicit pressure from adults to behave in ways that are \u201c acceptable.\n\u201d He learned to code-switch ; he became adept at shifting between his authentic self and \u201c palatable Black \u201d \u2013 presenting in ways that are less threatening to white people .\nElsewhere in the district , hundreds of Black students from Carol City High , Trayvon \u2019 s previous school , walked off campus in a spontaneous demonstration on March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street shouting \u201c Justice for Trayvon !\n\u201d as district officials deployed school buses to retrieve them .\nSome of the Black students at Krop held a similar , if less dramatic , walkout .\nMelesia McCants , who had known Trayvon since middle school , was one of them and remembers school officials initially resisting the students \u2019 plans .\nHer white classmates were hesitant to get on board , too , she said .\n\u201c It was only the Black students who wanted to push the issue ; our counterparts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c They cared , but they didn \u2019 t have that connection with him .\nSo they didn \u2019 t understand why it affected us the way it affected us.\n\u201d For Mills , it would take time to fully understand the moment \u2019 s influence .\nAfter a decade of protest , a decade of seeing videos of Black people killed , a decade of experiencing microaggressions and racism in the real world , he says his perspective has evolved .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve gone through so many anxieties being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said .\n\u201c I wish I would have gotten it back then .\nI would have been angrier ; I would have handled it differently.\n\u201d Mills was \u201c blindsided \u201d by the global racial justice movement that emerged from Trayvon \u2019 s death .\nMcCants calls it \u201c an eye-opener.\n\u201d Horton calls it \u201c amazing.\n\u201d \u201c I was thinking it was going to be a spur-of-the-moment thing .\nThat it was going to fall off , \u201d Horton said .\n\u201c But people kept pushing .\nIt never stopped.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change he has seen in the U.S .\nUnlike Zimmerman , three men received life sentences for Arbery \u2019 s murder .\nThree of the police officers who were involved in George Floyd \u2019 s death have been convicted of violating his civil rights .\nA fourth , Derek Chauvin , was convicted of his murder .\nThere \u2019 s progress , Horton says , awareness that he attributes to the proliferation of smartphones used to record these encounters .\nTrayvon , he notes , only had a flip phone .\nBut McCants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been real change .\nThe convictions are little comfort when the deaths are still happening .\nThe young mother knows she \u2019 ll have to have conversations with her son and daughter to ensure they get home safely .\nShe knows that , when they get older , she \u2019 ll have to tell them about Trayvon .\n\u201c Unfortunately he didn \u2019 t get to live out his dreams .\nBut he became a catalyst .\nHis story will live on for generations , \u201d McCants says .\n\u201c I hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need , but I \u2019 m glad the story is being heard .\n\u201d", "author": "Simone Sebastian", "url": "https://capitalbnews.org/the-trayvon-martin-ten-years/", "published": "Mon, 28 Feb 2022 19:57:28 +0000", "published_utc": 1646096248, "collection_utc": 1646096009}, {"id": "capitalbnews--2022-03-02--What Ketanji Brown Jackson\u2019s Supreme Court Appointment Would Mean for Black Americans", "date": "2022-03-02", "source": "capitalbnews", "title": "What Ketanji Brown Jackson\u2019s Supreme Court Appointment Would Mean for Black Americans", "content": "Ketanji Brown Jackson \u2019 s presence on the U.S. Supreme Court would not only diversify the nation \u2019 s highest bench with its first Black woman , it would add a perspective of the law that has rarely been heard in the court \u2019 s more than 230 years , legal experts say .\nPresident Joe Biden \u2019 s nominee is a former public defender and sentencing reformer whose family was directly affected by the tough-on-crime laws of the mass incarceration era .\nJackson \u2019 s experience with a side of the law more often seen by average Americans would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how the Constitution is interpreted and how the laws are implemented in the country , \u201d said Tiffany Jeffers , an associate professor at Georgetown University Law Center .\nIf confirmed , Jackson would take the seat of another liberal justice , Stephen Breyer , and join a court that is heavily weighted by former President Donald Trump \u2019 s conservative appointees .\nWhile her presence is unlikely to sway the court \u2019 s decisions on voting rights , policing , or other key issues for Black Americans , her perspective can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal arguments written by justices who disagree with the majority .\nJackson \u2019 s voice on the court \u201c offers a new energy .\nIt offers a chance to impact hearts and minds of those who can \u2019 t understand the plight of the average American , \u201d said Ada Goodly Lampkin , director of the Louis A.

Clarke School of Law .\nAbout 95 % of elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are white men , according to 2019 data from the Reflective Democracy Campaign , a project with the Women Donors Network .\nOn top of that lack of representation , prosecutors are also influenced by the fact that they work closely with police on a daily basis , legal experts say .\nAnd when they do charge officers , the cases they lay out in court can be less than stellar .\nBut in recent years , more voters have decided to elect prosecutors who campaign against the status quo .\nThe election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black and other people of color \u2013 has made a dent in how police officers are held accountable , said Irving Joyner , a professor at North Carolina Central University School of Law .\n\u201c You had to browbeat prosecutors to investigate crimes against African Americans .\n\u2026 Those cases were not brought to the public \u2019 s attention .\nJurors were not empanelled to listen to and hear the evidence , \u201d Joyner said .\n\u201c That has changed to the benefit of our system and now there are prosecutors in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playbook that has been in place.\n\u201d More from Capital B : \u2018 We Are Not Sub-Citizens \u2019 : Black Gun Owners Assert Their Rights after Amir Locke \u2019 s Killing Among those prosecutors is John J. Choi , county attorney for Ramsey County , Minnesota .\nHe was in office when Philando Castile was fatally shot by police officer Jeronimo Yanez during a traffic stop in July 2016 .\nChoi said he charged Yanez with second-degree manslaughter after reviewing the evidence and listening to the audio from the stop .\nCastile \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also in the car \u2013 told Yanez that he had a weapon in the car and that he wasn \u2019 t going to pull it out .\nChoi , who implemented a policy to stop prosecuting certain traffic stops after Castile \u2019 s death , said he heard the \u201c sincerity \u201d in Castile \u2019 s voice during the encounter , as opposed to the escalating actions of Yanez , who drew his weapon and opened fire .\n\u201c The officer , in his mind , races to the place where somehow Philando @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he \u2019 s got a 4-year-old in the backseat , a woman in the passenger seat .\nWhy would any human being do that ?\n\u201d Choi said .\n\u201c It was Philando who was trying to deescalate the situation.\n\u201d A prosecutor in Choi \u2019 s office took the case to trial in May 2017 .\nUltimately , Yanez was found not guilty \u2013 a decision that Choi , who was the first Korean-American chief prosecutor voted into office in the country , still hasn \u2019 t grasped .\nThere have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Michael Rosfeld , an officer in East Pittsburgh , was acquitted in the 2018 shooting death of Antwon Rose II , and Oklahoma officer Betty Jo Shelby was acquitted for the 2016 death of Terence Crutcher .\nNonetheless , Choi says he is encouraged by the \u201c evolution \u201d of progressive prosecutors who are getting elected across the country and are \u201c willing to take on these cases \u201d that were once thought as \u201c really hard to prove.\n\u201d Sometimes , that willingness has come amid public pressure , often sparked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on camera .\nVideo of Floyd \u2019 s death led to worldwide demonstrations as protesters chanted some of his final words , \u201c I can \u2019 t breathe \u201d \u2013 echoing the rallying cry for demonstrators after the July 2014 death of Eric Garner at the hands of police in Staten Island , New York .\nBut the outcome this time was different : In Garner \u2019 s case , no charges were brought against the officers involved in his death , and five years of fighting passed before one was fired .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ four officers were fired a day after the incident and charges came within a week .\nIn Arbery \u2019 s case , it took more than two months for charges to be filed , and only after two prosecutors recused themselves from the case .\nThe three white men who chased and killed Arbery went free for weeks until a video of the shooting went public .\nTwo days later , the Georgia Bureau of Investigation stepped in and filed murder charges .\nAnd almost a year after his death , the Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trio .\nWithout calls for justice from Arbery \u2019 s mother and civil rights advocates \u2013 as well as ongoing protests led by the Black Lives Matter movement \u2013 there \u2019 s no telling if charges would have been filed at all , said Joyner , who practiced law for 43 year also as a civil rights attorney .\n\u201c This push resulted from the lack of confidence in the system , but I think that level of confidence is rising now in some places .\nWe see even in the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an intent to apply the rules equally across racial lines , \u201d he said .\nAfter cellphone footage of Michael Brown \u2019 s dead body lying in the street went viral in 2014 , protests ignited in Ferguson , Missouri , and nationwide .\nBut Bob McCulloch , the St. Louis County prosecutor at the time , later announced that a grand jury had declined to file charges against Darren Wilson , the officer who shot and killed Brown .\nIn the next election , Wesley Bell \u2013 a former public defender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black prosecuting attorney in St. Louis County .\n\u201c Constituents are putting more pressure on their elected officials and their leaders to hold individuals accountable , \u201d said Bell .\n\u201c For anyone , just like any of us , if you commit a crime or if I committed a crime , we \u2019 re going to be held accountable and that should be true for anyone.\n\u201d But Bell soon showed that indicting police officers remains challenging .\nAfter reinvestigating Brown \u2019 s death , he chose not to indict Wilson .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ that decision , but at the time , he said charging Wilson \u201c would violate the ethical standards of my profession.\n\u201d \u201c When you don \u2019 t have the evidence and you have to tell the family that you can \u2019 t push the case , it can be the worst job , \u201d he said .\n\u201c At the end of the day , you just got ta do what \u2019 s right.\n\u201d Bell has charged other police officers for their conduct during his tenure .\nIn one case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 an alternative to prosecution in which felony charges were dropped against the police officer after she apologized in a video conference to the woman whom she shot in the back .\nSince Brown , Garner , and Floyd , Bell said he has spoken to many law enforcement officers who say they no longer can stand by and allow other officers \u2019 actions to define their entire departments .\nDuring the trial for Floyd \u2019 s murder , several of Chauvin \u2019 s former colleagues , including his former police chief , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence \u201d to testify against him \u2013 an act that Bell says \u201c builds trust in the justice system.\n\u201d \u201c For far too long , there are many communities that have never had that trust and good relationships with law enforcement , \u201d Bell said .\n\u201c It was hard to argue around .\nIt was so clear .\nSeeing someone die in front of you , as they call out for their mother , it \u2019 s hard to get around that and I think those officers felt compelled to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to jurors \u2019 race in these cases , legal experts say that the juries are a small factor in the recent run of convictions .\nThe jurors were mostly white in the successful prosecutions for the deaths of Floyd , Arbery and Wright .\nChoi said he believes that some jurors have changed hearts and minds and are \u201c choosing to see the evidence in a different way , \u201d without reforming laws already in place .\n\u201c Not too long ago , we just didn \u2019 t have body-worn camera evidence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject to only have in front of us \u2026 testimony that came from police , as well as any witnesses , \u201d Choi said .\n\u201c But oftentimes in the police-involved fatalities , the only witnesses are the police because often the person who \u2019 s the victim is dead.\n\u201d In all of the recent convictions , Hansford notes , trial prosecutors were able to present compelling evidence of the defendant \u2019 s ill intentions \u2013 body camera footage , cellphone videos , social media posts , text messages and witness testimony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously could not deny voting for a guilty verdict , he said .\nJoyner added that it really takes a strong case before the trial to ensure a conviction .\n\u201c To me , that \u2019 s the key to the whole thing : strong prosecution , strong investigation , and then competent presentation of the evidence to the jury , \u201d he said .\n\u201c More often than not , that is going to result in the right decision .\n\u201d", "author": "Christina Carrega", "url":

when traffic jams the highway .\nBut it \u2019 s a trip some of Dr. Joy Cooper \u2019 s patients were willing to take to see a provider who looked like them .\n\u201c Otherwise , \u201d she said , \u201c they would not see a Black physician.\n\u201d Finding a Black provider who is in a patient \u2019 s insurance network , works nearby and is accepting new patients can be difficult , said Cooper , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOnly 3 % of active physicians are Black women , but their presence is crucial given the history of medical mistreatment and health disparities facing Black Americans .\nThe result : Patients drive dozens of miles for health care or , she said , \u201c people end up settling for less.\n\u201d Inspired by the need to increase access to Black women physicians , Cooper partnered with another doctor , Monique Smith , in 2018 to found Culture Care .\nThe digital health site links Black women with culturally similar doctors who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their in-person medical teams .\nIt was a move toward digital medicine before telehealth made its mark in health care amid the COVID-19 pandemic , using it as a potential solution to address racial health disparities .\nCulture Care is among a wave of digital platforms and apps created to connect Black women with physicians and therapists who look like them in an effort to overcome some of the barriers that lead Black women to avoid getting needed physical and mental health care \u2013 and to receive substandard service when they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Race Matters So Much to Your Health They include sites like Therapy for Black Girls , a service focused on destigmatizing mental health , and Health in Her Hue , which offers a database of culturally competent providers in dermatology , oncology and other specialties .\nThe digital services were largely created by Black doctors and patients , women who are increasingly breaking into the tech space as entrepreneurs and using technology to address disparities in their communities .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a more robust understanding now of the importance of having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care team as a Black person , as a part of a marginalized community , \u201d said Maya Hardigan , who launched her own platform last year .\n\u201c It actually can impact your health outcomes.\n\u201d It was the height of the pandemic and racial justice protests in 2020 that inspired Hardigan to sit down with her husband and assess if the family of five living in New York City could take on the risk of Hardigan leaving her job and launching a startup .\nHer vision was a digital maternal health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black moms .\nIt launched last fall after she workshopped the product and built a small team .\nIt \u2019 s now called Meet Mae \u2013 a platform that offers health tracking , maternal health tips , and a database of culturally competent obstetricians .\nAcross the country , Black patients outnumber Black physicians , especially Black women .\nThe proportion of Black physicians nationwide has increased by only 4 percentage points over the past 120 years , according to a study last year by UCLA .\nIn 1900 , Black people made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 1 % of physicians .\nMore than a century later , Black Americans were 13 % of the population in 2018 and just 5 % of physicians .\nIn Detroit , a city that is overwhelmingly Black , Dr. Ijeoma Nnodim Opara says , \u201c Oftentimes , I \u2019 m still one of the very few Black doctors that they get to see.\n\u201d Research shows that for Black Americans , being cared for by a doctor who looks like them can protect patients against some disparate health outcomes .\nIn childbirth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survive when cared for by a Black doctor , according to a 2020 study .\nThe researchers found that Black newborns were nearly three times more likely to die than white babies when cared for by white doctors .\nThe mortality rate for white babies remained unchanged by the physician \u2019 s race .\nAnother study by Penn Medicine researchers showed that patients who see doctors of their own race are more likely to rate their health care experience higher .\nHardigan \u2019 s model is based on the notion that small interventions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of pregnancy and increased awareness of the signs and symptoms that patients should seek immediate medical attention for , can save lives .\n\u201c I can have an impact without being in the same room , \u201d said Culture Care \u2019 s Cooper .\nIts team includes a pediatrician , family medicine physician , lactation specialist , and mental health therapist .\nThe staff answers patients \u2019 questions , advises on whether immediate medical intervention might be necessary , and serves as an additional support to Black patients .\nIt \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historically present in Black neighborhoods when residents knew their local doctors and trusted them , Cooper said .\nThe motivation for Culture Care came from Smith \u2019 s personal experience as a patient in the maternity ward .\nShe had been in labor 22 hours , and there were multiple complications .\nDuring postpartum recovery after an emergency C-section , Smith reached out to Cooper , who answered every text and phone call .\nSmith was concerned about her blood pressure and about the healing of her incisions .\nIt was extra support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system and access a doctor who looked like her \u2013 one that she knew and trusted .\n\u201c We \u2019 re a one-stop shop that you don \u2019 t have to leave your home to go to , \u201d Cooper said .\nA lot of times , patients will sit at home not feeling well or wondering about symptoms without heading to emergency care centers , in large part , she said , due to mistrust .\n\u201c Even if we can \u2019 t do everything here , sometimes you need someone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Detroit physician , notes that the culture and norms within the medical system are built for white physicians .\nOpara knew as a teenager that she wanted to go into medicine , but as an undergrad , she majored in African studies and learned about the disparities pervasive in health , education , wealth , and criminal justice .\n\u201c That informed the way I engaged with medicine , \u201d said Opara .\nAddressing the social factors that influence health , particularly structural racism , is critical for improving health outcomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The outlook for Black women looking for Black OB-GYNs for pregnancy care is somewhat brighter .\nIn the speciality , Black women make up about 7 % of active physicians , according to the Association of American Medical Colleges .\nStill , maternal mortality rates are increasing .\nAnd Black women remain three to four times more likely to die due to pregnancy-related complications than white women .\n\u201c There \u2019 s not one silver bullet answer , \u201d said Hardigan , Meet Mae \u2019 s founder .\nMore from Capital B : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are working against racism and bias in maternal health care as well as elevated rates of chronic conditions impacted by often limited access to quality , culturally competent care , she said .\nSmall interactions eroded the trust she \u2019 d had with her providers during her own pregnancy .\n\u201c What they tell us is that we \u2019 re not really being seen and treated for all of who we are , \u201d Hardigan said .\nShe was a Black woman working within the health system with good insurance and solid financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet I still felt a lot of marginalization.\n\u201d A lot of the writing on Meet Mae \u2019 s websites is by Black women reflecting on what worked throughout their pregnancies and what did not .\n\u201c We can share in our experiences , \u201d said Hardigan , \u201c and let our users know we \u2019 ve been there.\n\u201d It \u2019 s a space for an open conversation on what it means to be Black and pregnant with maternal death rates increasing .\nIt also provides real-time symptom tracking with weekly check-ins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerns .\nIt \u2019 s a pregnancy companion , Hardigan said , that lets moms know what they should be looking for at each stage of pregnancy and when to seek medical attention , if needed .\nMeet Mae also connects families to doulas and lactation consultants , and offers culturally competent lifestyle tips .\n\u201c This feels deeply personal for me as a mom of three girls , \u201d said Hardigan .\n\u201c We \u2019 re really looking to see the tide shift in time for the next generation .", "author": "Margo Snipe", "url":

sit back for a second , \u2018 cause I don \u2019 t have questions right away .\nI actually have a number of things I just want to say , because this has been not a surprise given the history that we all know \u2013 not a surprise , but perhaps a little bit of a disappointment , some of the things that \u2019 ve been said in this hearing .\nThe way you have dealt with some of these things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge and I am a politician because you have sat with grit and grace and have shown us just extraordinary demeanor during the times where people were saying things to you that are actually out of the norm .\nI had to go up dais to ask some of my more senior colleagues about what I feel like is a dangerous precedent .\nPeople are taking a thousand cases you \u2019 ve been over \u2013 is that right ?\nI \u2019 m sorry I said I wouldn \u2019 t ask you questions but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that .\nBooker : Something like that .\nAnd from what I understand , these cases sometimes take days , weeks , sometimes months , right ?\nJackson : To decide in a case ?\nYes .\nBooker : There \u2019 s a trial sometimes , and folks are taking any of those cases and just trying to pick pieces out .\nAnd so my my colleague Senator Hawley has been doing this all into the lead up , and saying things , tweeting things that I think that a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get some advice here , is this is what the new standard \u2019 s going to be : that any judge coming before us that has ever chosen outside of the sentencing guidelines , below the sentencing guidelines .\nWe \u2019 re creating this environment now where I can make myself the hero of people who have been victims of some horrible crime and suddenly put whatever judge I want on the defensive by trying to drag out little bits when they have no context to the case \u2013 none of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploit the complexities of a criminal justice system , the reason why we have a third branch of government .\nI feel bad that there was a judge mentioned by name in this hearing that \u2019 s from Senator Hawley \u2019 s state .\nWhat is that judge going to think next time that they have a complicated sexual abuse case that comes before them

well-respected conservative periodical \u2013 this is the National Review , very well-respected and not something I agree with all the time .\nBut here \u2019 s what the National Review \u2013 this is

ask you the question , \u2018 Do you regret ?\n\u2019 \u2013 I wonder if they regret that , that they didn \u2019 t bring that out .\nNo , why ?\nBecause it was an allegation that is \u2018 meritless to the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don \u2019 t mean this in any way , \u2018 cause if anybody called me average I would be upset \u2013 but you are a mainstream judge .\nYour sentencing , I \u2019 ve looked

on the Law Review \u2013 you did .\nI didn \u2019 t clerk at every level of the federal court ; you clerked for a Supreme Court justice , one widely respected on both sides , which really shaped you .\nYou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice , and you know what you found ?\nThis is what you told me : That you had those tough choices that working moms have to make , the demands of a private law firm , raising your kids \u2013 it just didn \u2019 t add up .\nYou went before the Senate three times in a bipartisan manner \u2013 god bless America , we don \u2019 t do that much stuff bipartisan around here .\nYou went to become a public defender \u2018 cause you wanted to understand all aspects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We live in a society that \u2019 s very materialistic sometimes , very consumeristic .\nYou went \u2013 do people become public defenders for the money ?\nNo .\nYour family and you speak to service , service , service .\nAnd I \u2019 m telling you right now , I \u2019 m not letting anybody in the Senate steal my joy .\nI told you this at the beginning , I \u2019 m embarrassed .\nIt happened earlier today : I just look at you and I start getting full of emotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at the end of the block I live on \u2013 \u2018 cause I put my music on loud when I \u2019 m jogging , trying to block out the noise of the heart attack I \u2019 m having \u2013 and this woman comes up on me , practically tackles me , an African American woman .\nAnd the look on her eyes \u2013 she just wanted to touch me , \u2018 cause I think \u2018 cause I \u2019 m sitting so close to you \u2013 and tell me what it meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you \u2019 re sitting .\nAnd you did not get there because of some left-wing agenda .\nYou didn \u2019 t get here \u2018 cause of some dark money groups .\nYou got here how every Black woman in America who has gotten anywhere has done : by being like Ginger Rogers said , \u201c I did everything Fred Astaire did but backwards in heels.\n\u201d And so I \u2019 m just sitting here saying nobody \u2019 s stealing my joy , nobody \u2019 s going to make me angry , especially not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine \u201c demagogic \u201d for what they \u2019 re bringing up that just doesn \u2019 t hold water .\nI \u2019 m not gon na let my joy be stolen , because I know \u2013 you and I \u2013 we appreciate something that we get that a lot of my colleagues don \u2019 t .\nI know Tim Scott does .\nWhen I first came to this place I was the fourth black person ever popularly elected to the United States Senate , and I still remember a lot of mixed people \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , but at night when people are in line to come in to clean this place , the percentage of minorities shift a lot .\nSo I \u2019 m walking here , first week I \u2019 m here , and somebody \u2019 s been here for decades doing the urgent work of the Senate , but it \u2019 s the unglamorous work that goes on no matter who \u2019 s in offices , guy comes up to me and all he wants to say , I can tell , is \u201c I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here.\n\u201d But he comes up , he can \u2019 t get the words out , and this man , my elder , starts crying .\nAnd I just hugged him and he just kept telling me , \u201c It \u2019 s so good to see you here ; it \u2019 s so good to see you here .\nThank you , thank you , thank you.\n\u201d I love my brother Tim Scott , we could write a dissertation on our disagreements .\nHe gave the best speech on race \u2013 I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a speech \u2013 but talking to the challenges and indignities that are still faced .\nAnd you \u2019 re here .\nI was in the White House with my Democratic colleagues \u2013 and again , I \u2019 m in my joy ; I can \u2019 t help it \u2013 and the president is asking for advice , who should be nominated , whatever .\nAnd I look at Kamala , and we have a knowing glance , which we \u2019 ve had for years when she and I used to sit on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times .\nAnd then I try to get out to the president what it means \u2013 what it means .\nAnd I want to tell you , when I look at you , this is why I get emotional .\nI \u2019 m sorry , you \u2019 re a person that is so much more than your race and gender .\nYou \u2019 re a Christian , you \u2019 re a mom , you \u2019 re an intellect , you love books .\nBut for me , I \u2019 m sorry , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at you and not see my mom , not to see my cousins , one of them who had to come here and sit behind you .\nShe had to have your back .\nI see my ancestors and yours .\nNobody \u2019 s going to steal the joy of that woman in the street , or the calls that I \u2019 m getting , or the texts .\nNobody \u2019 s going to steal that joy .\nYou have earned this spot .\nYou are worthy .\nYou are a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Motley .\nMine , she \u2019 s sat on my desk for my offices that I \u2019 ve held .\nShe \u2019 s my icon of America .\nHer name is Harriet Tubman .\nThere \u2019 s a love in this country that is extraordinary .\nYou admitted it about your parents .\nThey loved this nation even though there were laws preventing them from getting together .\nWhen they were loving , there were laws in this country that would have prevented you from marrying your husband .\nIt wasn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last generation .\nBut they didn \u2019 t stop loving this country , even though this country didn \u2019 t love them back .\nAnd what were the words of your heroes and mine ?\nWhat did Constance Baker Motley do ?\nDid she \u2013 this country that she saw insults and injuries , when she came out of law school , law firms wouldn \u2019 t even hire her because she was a woman .\nDid she become bitter ?\nDid she try to create a revolution ?\nNo , she used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She loved it so much , she wanted America to be America .\nAs Langston Hughes wrote , Let America be America , again , The land that never has been yet , But yet must be the land where everyone is free .\nAmerica never was America to me , but I swear this oath , America will be !\nThat is the story of how you got to this desk .\nYou and I and everyone here , generations of folk who came here and said , \u201c America , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no Irish or dogs need apply , but I \u2019 m gon na show this country that I can be free here .\nI can make this country love me as much as I love it.\n\u201d Chinese Americans \u2013 forced into near slave labor building our railroads , connecting our country \u2013 saw the ugliest of America .\nBut they were going to build their home here , saying \u201c America , you may not love me yet , but I \u2019 m going to make this nation live up to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stonewall , women to Seneca , hidden figures who didn \u2019 t even get their play until some Hollywood movie talked about them and how they were critical for us defying gravity .\nAll of these people loved America .\nAnd so you faced insults here that were shocking to me , well actually not shocking .\nBut you are here because of that kind of love , and nobody \u2019 s taking this away from me .\nSo you got five more folks to go through , five more of us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let us have all the debates .\nAnd I \u2019 m going to tell you , it \u2019 s going to be a well-charted Senate floor , because it \u2019 s not going to stop , they \u2019 re going to accuse you of this and that .\nHeck , in honor of your person who shares your birthday , you might be called a communist .\nBut don \u2019 t worry , my sister , don \u2019 t worry .\nGod has got you .\nAnd how do I know that ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what it \u2019 s taken for you to sit in that seat .\nHarriet Tumban is one of my heroes because the more I read about this person , the more \u2013 I mean , she was viciously beaten .\nHer whole life she used to fall under spells , cracked skull .\nShe faced starvation , chased by dogs .\nAnd when she got to freedom , what did she do ?\nShe rested ?\nNo , she went back , again and again and again .\nThe sky was full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was a harbinger of hope \u2013 for better days .\nNot just for her and those people who were enslaved , but a harbinger of hope for this country .\nShe never gave up on America .\nShe fought in \u2013 led troops in the Civil War .\nShe was involved in the suffrage movement .\nAnd as I came back from my run , after being near assaulted by someone on the street , I thought about her and how she looked up , she kept looking up .\nNo matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never stopped looking up .\nAnd that star was a harbinger of hope .\nToday , you \u2019 re my star .\nYou are my harbinger of hope .\nThis country is getting better and better and better .\nWhen that final vote happens and you ascend onto the highest court in the land , I \u2019 m gon na rejoice .\nAnd I \u2019 m gon na tell you right now : The greatest

\u2019 s unqualified , she \u2019 s radical , she \u2019 s a beneficiary of affirmative action .\nThat playbook was on display in the U.S. Capitol this week as Ketanji Brown Jackson , the first Black woman to be nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court , was questioned by members of the Senate Judiciary Committee .\nSome Republican members sought to paint her as a radical , grilling her on critical

couldn \u2019 t stomach \u201d sitting through a second .\n\u201c I think for anyone \u2013 especially a woman of color , who has been through that type of blistering attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said

Josh Hawley , a Republican from Missouri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s sentencing of child pornography offenders , characterizing her track record as excessively lenient .\nHis charges have been widely dismissed , even by some on the right .\nBooker seems to be establishing a sense of common , bipartisan ground on what he views as insincere attacks and criticisms of Judge Jackson meant to score political points with the victims and loved ones of child sex crimes .\nThey \u2019 re seeking to exploit the complexities of a criminal justice system , the reason why we have a third branch of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a judge mentioned by name in this hearing that \u2019 s from Senator Hawley \u2019 s state .\nWhat is that judge going to think next time that they have a complicated sexual abuse case that comes before them ?\nAnd they know that they could possibly be called out if they go below the sentencing guidelines , which I showed you yesterday in my lack of chart \u2013 if you remember , I was uncharted \u2013 but that you are deciding completely in the norm .\nSeventy-plus percent in many states are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capital B insight : Booker is making a joke about the Republican senators who used prepared charts to reinforce their points during questioning of Jackson .\nRepublican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas displayed a chart of eight cases in which Judge Jackson sentenced a defendent below the prosecutor \u2019 s recommendation and the sentencing guidelines .\nIt \u2019 s not clear where Booker is getting the \u201c 70-plus \u201d statistic , but his point that it \u2019 s not uncommon for judges to hand down sentences outside of guidelines is valid .\nA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that at least 21 % of offenders received sentences below the guidelines .\nIn one case that Republican senators mentioned , Judge Jackson sentenced an 18-year-old to three months in jail for possession of child pornography .\nJackson explained that while there are sentencing guidlines , trial judges are not bound to abide by them and have discretion in handing down appropriate sentences on a case-by-case basis .\nBut I \u2019 m a Democratic senator .\nI \u2019 ve never quoted from this very well-respected conservative periodical \u2013 this is the National Review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree with all the time .\nBut here \u2019 s what the National Review \u2013 this is the title : \u201c Senator Hawley \u2019 s disingenuous attack against Judge Jackson \u2019 s record on child pornography.\n\u201d I \u2019 ll just read the first paragraph : \u201c I would oppose Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson because of her judicial philosophy for the reasons I outlined last week .\nI addressed that in a separate post .\nFor now , I wanted to discuss the claim by Senator Josh Hawley that Judge Jackson is appallingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allegations appear meritless to the point of demagoguery.\n\u201d I got letters from leaders of victims \u2019 rights groups , survivors of assault .\nAll saying sort of the same thing as the National Review .\nFeel proud about yourself ; you brought together right and left in this calling out of people that will sit up here and try to pull out from cases , and try to put themselves in a position where they \u2019 re the defenders of our children to a person who has children , to a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and defends children .\nI mean , this is a new low .\nCapital B insight : Judge Jackson \u2019 s brother , Ketajh Brown , was a Balitmore police officer and served in the Army .\nAnd what \u2019 s especially surprising about this is it didn \u2019 t happen last year .\nYou were put on a court that I \u2019 m told is considered , like , the second most powerful court in our land , and you were passed with bipartisan support .\nNobody brought it up then .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Were they lax ?\nDid they make a mistake ?\nI wonder \u2013 as they ask you the question , \u2018 Do you regret ?\n\u2019 \u2013 I wonder if they regret that , that they didn \u2019 t bring that out .\nNo , why ?\nBecause it was an allegation that is \u2018 meritless to the point of demagoguery.\n\u2019 Capital B insight : Last year , Judge Jackson was confirmed with bipartisan support to serve on the appellate court in Washington , D.C. Republican Sens .\nLindsey Graham of South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susan Collins of Maine , voted to confirm her for that position .\nYet , earlier this week , Graham stormed out of Judge Jackson \u2019 s confirmation hearing after questioning her about her sentencing decisions on child pornography cases .\nIt \u2019 s not clear if Collins and Murkowski will vote for Judge Jackson this time .\nYou are \u2013 I don \u2019 t mean this in any way , \u2018 cause if anybody called me average I would be upset \u2013 but you are a mainstream judge .\nYour sentencing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , falls in the mainstream on everything from child sexual assault to all the other issues that people are trying to bring up .\nSome of these things that are being cast at you , that you called George Bush a war criminal ?\nCome on , that is painful , especially \u2018 cause as you said , the brief changed .\nThese are names that you have to put in .\nAnd we \u2019 re talking about a real issue that goes to the core of our values : torture .\nBarack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bush left office .\nThere is an absurdity to this that is , it is almost comical if it was not so dangerous .\nCapital B insight : As a federal defender , Judge Jackson represented accused terrorists in a case related to torture and inhumane treatment at Guantanamo Bay .\nIn court filings , she said that former President George W. Bush committed acts that constitute war crimes .\nBecause the United States is protected from lawsuits by sovereign immunity , Judge Jackson explained , \u201c you have to file it against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2026 So whoever is the executive at the time becomes the named party in the brief.\n\u201d Because the next time a judge comes before us on the right or the left that has a body of work like you do , gosh , one of \u2026 some performance artists on our side could pull out one of the cases where they were below the sentencing guidelines .\nSay , for example , it was on something as horrific as rape , that we all agree is horrific , and they could suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How dare we put someone who \u2019 s soft on crime \u2026 \u201d Well , are you soft on crime ?\nGod bless America .\nI got this great text .\nI \u2019 ve become really good friends with folks at the FOP [ Fraternal Order of Police ] for my negotiations , and this was my favorite text .\nYou all got ta get this .\nI think my brother Kennedy might get a kick out of this .\nHe goes , \u201c Things that are uncountable : Stars in the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the number of times Democrats will mention that the FOP endorsed Judge Jackson in this hearing.\n\u201d [ laughter ] But let me mention it again , just in case my people say , your-rough-on-crime folks really want to try to make that stick .\nYou were endorsed by the largest organization of rank-and-file police officers .\nYou were endorsed by the bosses , the largest organization of chiefs of police .\nAnd you were endorsed by NOBLE , who I hope people find out more about that organization .\nYou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a brother , not just an officer , who went to serve after 9/11 .\nYour family \u2019 s not soft on terrorism ; he went out there to capture and kill and defend this country from terrorists .\nI \u2019 m actually sitting back here and finding this astonishing , but then I do my homework .\nCapital B insight : While the national Fraternal Order of Police did not agree with all of Judge Jackson \u2019 s views on reducing mandatory minimums while she served on the U.S .\nSentencing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d and have \u201c found that collaboration works far better than confrontation , \u201d according to FOP \u2019 s statement of support for the judge \u2019 s nomination .\nFrederick Thomas , president for the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives ( NOBLE ) , testified on behalf of Judge Jackson on the last day of the confirmation hearings .\nThe organization \u201c represents over 3,400 members worldwide that consist of chief executive officers and command-level law enforcement officials from federal , state , county , municipal law enforcement agencies , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas \u2019 s opening remarks .\nI love that my colleague brought up Constance Baker Motley .\nYou know when she was getting to the floor of the Senate , they were trying to stop her with outrageous accusations .\nYou know what the accusation was back then ?\nShe was a communist \u2013 dragging up stories , trying to throw anything that they [ thought ] might stick .\nBut this is what you and I know : Any one of us senators could yell as loud as we want that Venus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can yell as loud as we want that Beyonc\u00e9 can \u2019 t sing ;

strategists say .\nBiden made police reform a major part of his presidential campaign , but instead , his administration has proposed a more than $ 32 billion increase in funding for police in the 2023 budget .\nThe 2023 budget proposal includes almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including more than $ 1 billion in new investments in reducing gun violence and violent crime and $ 3 billion in sustained

the suburbs and the suburbs are critical \u201d during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contentious parts of police reform is qualified immunity , which prevents police officers from being held civilly liable for actions that they believe are reasonable and necessary based on their training while on duty .\nQualified immunity \u201c results in too many police officers doing too many egregious constitutional violations , \u201d McDougall said .\nBut , he noted that \u201c there \u2019 s at least some consensus on it \u201d between lawmakers .\n\u201c If you look at it from a perspective of pure rational conduct , if a police officer thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immune from suit , they \u2019 re more likely to do things that will violate people \u2019 s constitutional rights , \u201d McDougall said .\n\u201c Similarly , on the other side , if a police officer thinks that they might be liable for that sort of conduct , they will do less than that .\nAnd the question is how do you balance where the line should be drawn ?\n\u201d Since 2005 , \u201c appellate courts have shown an increasing tendency to grant immunity in excessive force cases , \u201d according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruled in favor of police receiving qualified immunity in 57 % of reviewed cases involving allegations of excessive use of force between 2017 and 2019 , the report showed .\nInimai Chettiar , the federal director for the

bills to find overlapping measures to encourage lawmakers to come up with bipartisan legislation .\nChettiar \u2019 s organization , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , supports Republican Indiana Sen. Mike Braun \u2019 s Reforming Qualified Immunity Act , which would \u201c reinstate the original qualified immunity standard.\n\u201d The bill would not protect officials when sued if they were found

significantly change the police , \u201d said Moffett .\n\u201c What I know about the climate and the political environment at the moment , and I \u2019 m telling you , it \u2019 s not good for

public matter , \u201d she said .\n\u201c They probably could have acted quicker if they had a bipartisan bill to begin with.\n\u201d Chettiar predicts that there will be bipartisan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in

Graves : It changes the issues that are on the table .\nPeople bring their whole selves .\nPeople don \u2019 t like to think of judges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re also humans .\nAnd so people bring their whole

that has meant is that in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself has been the person to provide the perspective of the Black experience in this country .\nSo having multiple perspectives is a thing that I think will make the court better .\nAnd then I guess my last point here , because I \u2019 ve been thinking about it a lot , the court is considering a range of issues that so deeply impact the lives of Black

understanding of their full humanity .\nAnd I think that \u2019 s something she \u2019 s going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her criminal defense background and her lived experiences , because not only does she

Why Are Black Donors Still So Rare?", "content": "It was during a road trip that Steven Robinson stopped to visit his former college roommate and noticed something was wrong .\nRichard Koonce had lost weight \u2013 evidence of the dwindling appetite and low energy that the 62-year-old had been experiencing for the past two years .\nKoonce revealed that he had been struggling with primary sclerosing cholangitis , a disease that causes inflammation of the bile ducts , leading to cirrhosis .\nPSC ultimately can cause liver failure \u2014 unless the patient gets a liver transplant .\nThe former Norfolk State University classmates realized that they had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a heart stress test and an MRI scan later , Robinson became a living donor .\nHe volunteered to give 60 % of his liver to Koonce , and the friends went through the procedure last month .\n\u201c Everybody overwhelmingly said yes and if you \u2019 re a match , you should go for it , \u201d said Robinson , 57 .\n\u201c It was never a question.\n\u201d Ultimately , Koonce \u2019 s body rejected Robinson \u2019 s liver .\nBut because the procedure already had been done , Koonce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waitlist .\nSix days later , he got a second liver , from a deceased donor .\n\u201c If my friend hadn \u2019 t stepped up to be a living donor , I wouldn \u2019 t have had a transplant , \u201d he said .\nKoonce \u2019 s happy ending was a rare outcome for Black Americans .\nDespite being only 13 % of the population , Black people make up nearly 30 % of those waiting for a transplant , according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : For kidney transplants , Black patients make up 32 % of those waiting .\nFor heart transplants , they make up about a quarter .\nThe overrepresentation is , in part , due to disparities in chronic conditions like hypertension and diabetes \u2014 both of which disproportionately impact Black people .\nThey are almost four times more likely to suffer from kidney failure than white people .\nThe longer wait times for transplants is exacerbated by the lack of matching donors .\nIn addition to matching blood types , a patient \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an organ from a donor of the same ethnicity .\n\u201c The problem is we don \u2019 t have that many African American donors , \u201d said Marion Shuck , vice president of governmental relations and external affairs at Gift of Hope , an organ and tissue donor network .\n\u201c When you don \u2019 t have information , when you have medical mistrust , when you \u2019 ve been mistreated by the health care system , it creates a problem.\n\u201d Access to transplants is further hindered by the way race has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organ function and the need for certain interventions .\nFor example , in evaluating kidney function , medical professionals sometimes rely on algorithms that use a \u201c race correction \u201d that assumes Black patients have a higher level of creatinine \u2014 a byproduct made by muscles \u2014 in their blood .\nIn some cases , that leads to estimates of kidney function that place Black patients lower on the list for transplants and interventions .\nA number of doctors and associations have spoken out against the race correction .\nSome institutions are removing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there \u2019 s racism , \u201d said Velma Scantlebury-White , a retired surgeon who performed more than 2,000 transplants .\n\u201c We have certain formulas and algorithms that often put patients at a disadvantage.\n\u201d Scantlebury-White earned her medical degree in 1981 and went on to become the first Black female transplant surgeon in the U.S .\nHer work focused on kidney transplants , where she felt like she could impact the Black community , and she has advocated for increasing Black living donors .\nShe told her patients that if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could avoid dialysis , meaning potential for a better lifestyle and lower risk of death .\nShe encouraged them to get friends and family involved in the process of finding a donor to increase the likelihood of finding a match .\nAnd when she spoke to healthy people , she talked about the importance of early diagnosis , emphasizing regular physicals as well as blood and urine tests .\n\u201c Get a copy of your labs so you can see what \u2019 s normal and what \u2019 s abnormal .\nKnow your numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from clinical work in 2020 .\nShe now focuses on community education and mentorship , noting that bias persists not only for Black patients but transplant doctors , as well .\nDuring her more than 30 years as a surgeon , she found it was difficult for communities to accept her as their surgeon .\nPatients questioned her credentials .\nNurses doubted her abilities .\nMoments of self-doubt sometimes spiraled into depression , she said .\nNow , part of her mission is to increase diversity in her field .\nShe tells her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every now and then , but to not let others devalue them because they don \u2019 t see their potential .\n\u201c We still have this leaky pipeline because of the inequities , \u201d Scantlebury-White said of aspiring Black female surgeons .\n\u201c It becomes an obligation for us to bring them along and for them to be prepared for the issues they will face.\n\u201d She also feels an obligation to advocate for Black Americans to take ownership of their health care , particularly those with a history of conditions like high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nShe encourages patients to remind their doctors about that history and to keep track of their blood-test results .\nAn awareness of his body , and a lot of reading , helped Koonce advocate for better health care .\nAs he lost weight and energy , his doctor misdiagnosed him .\n\u201c Everything I read told me it wasn \u2019 t Crohn \u2019 s disease , \u201d said Koonce , a college prep director in Ohio .\nHe went vegan and started to feel better but realized his Crohn

of organ transplants crossed 41,000 , a record number .\nMore than 9,000 were for Black patients .\nThe goal among organ procurement organizations nationwide is to reach 50,000 total transplants by 2026 .\nMost people think being an organ donor is good , said Shuck , but when it comes to moving forward with getting tested for a living donation or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitancy arises .\nShuck said she often has to debunk myths when she \u2019 s engaging with the community .\nShe explains that having a preexisting condition does not necessarily preclude you from donating organs and that being

.\nWhile the case of one mother-daughter pair is just that \u2014 a case study \u2014 their experiences sync up with the thousands of cases examined by Drs .\nDavid and Collins .\nI learned about their work while conducting research for my 2018 New York Times Magazine cover story , \u201c The Hidden Toll : Why America \u2019 s Black Mothers and Babies Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s , the two neonatologists set out to unravel the mystery of why in America Black infants are more than twice as likely as white babies to die before reaching their first birthdays .\nAt the time , the high rate of infant mortality in Black women was widely believed by almost everyone , including doctors and public health experts , to affect only poor , less educated women who do have disproportionate numbers of lost babies .\nThe underlying assumption was that poor Black teen moms had driven up rates of preterm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers of infant deaths .\nHowever , when the research pair analyzed the records of more than 100,000 births in Chicago between 1982 and 1983 , they found that while income and education offered some protection , babies of more educated , higher-income Black parents were still more likely to be born small compared with their white counterparts .\nNext , they wondered if the problem could be related to genetics : Could a preterm birth or low-birth-weight gene be the reason ?\nIf a defect in the Black body was causing infants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the West African countries where the ancestors of African American women had been captured should have a similar problem of small babies .\nWhat \u2019 s more , if the problem was produced by an inherited racial trait , shouldn \u2019 t it be less pronounced in Black American women , who , as a population , had more European ancestry than their African-born counterparts ?\nTo test their theory , Drs .\nDavid and Collins examined the records of tens of thousands of babies born in Illinois between 1980 and 1995 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women : U.S.-born Blacks , African-born Blacks , and U.S.-born whites .\nIn their 1997 study , published in The New England Journal of Medicine , they found that the infants of the immigrant women from Africa were closely matched in size to the white , not the Black , U.S.-born babies .\nIn other words , despite the disadvantages they experienced by being brought up in poorer , less developed nations , their newborns were larger and more likely to be full term than babies born to African American women .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleague Shou-Yien Wu , MD , revisited the mystery of racial disparities in infant mortality .\nThis time around they dismissed the preterm gene theory and were also careful to note that age , education , marital status , income , cigarette smoking , and the interval between pregnancies fail to account for African American infants \u2019 birth-weight disadvantage .\nFor this study , published in the American Journal of Epidemiology , Drs .\nDavid and Collins looked at the birth records of infants born in Illinois between 1989 and 1991 , along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born between 1956 and 1975 \u2014 a total of approximately 328,000 infants .\nThe researchers added two more groups of women along with their mothers : white immigrant mothers from Europe and Black moms from the Caribbean .\nTo their surprise , the grandchildren of the Caribbean and African immigrant women were born smaller than their mothers had been at birth .\nThe bottom line : the Black immigrant women \u2019 s grandchildren were more likely to be small , just like African American babies .\nIn contrast , once the daughters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d the weight of their infants shifted upward .\nFinally , in 2007 , Drs .\nDavid and Collins combined their previous studies into one deep dive that appeared in the American Journal of Public Health .\nFor this study , they not only considered the effects of race but also looked at the more provocative question of what impact racism had on Black mothers and their babies .\nThe pair spoke with Black women who had babies with normal weights at birth , comparing them with those whose babies were born under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they had ever been treated unfairly because of their race when looking for a job , in an educational setting , or in other situations .\nThose who experienced discrimination had a twofold increase in low birth weights .\nFor those who reported discrimination in all three areas , the increase was nearly threefold .\nThe researchers \u2019 conclusion : Low birth weights among African American women have more to do with the experience of racism than with race .\nI first began thinking about the Black-white disparity in preterm birth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the health editor of Essence magazine from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s .\nAt the time , I followed the conventional wisdom : that only poor women who lacked knowledge experienced tragic birth outcomes .\nThis reflexive explanation for the death of a baby boiled down to blaming the mother , particularly if she was poor and Black .\nWas she eating badly , smoking , drinking , using drugs , not taking prenatal vitamins or getting enough rest , afraid to be proactive during prenatal visits , skipping them altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I revised my thinking in the early 1990s when a piece of research shook my core belief that we could educate our way out of the problem of poor birth outcomes plaguing Black America .\nIn 1992 , The New England Journal of Medicine contained what is now considered the watershed study on race , class , and infant mortality , unique because it isolated race in itself as a risk factor for poor birth outcomes .\nThe study mined a database of close to a million previously unavailable linked birth and death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college-educated Black parents were twice as likely to die as infants born of similarly educated white parents .\nIn 75 % of the cases , low birth weight was to blame .\nI was confused and skeptical : why would educated Black parents who could afford health care suffer from this issue ?\nThe only partial answer : stress .\nIn 1996 , I became pregnant , and the research became all too real for me .\nAt the time , I had been promoted from health editor of Essence to executive editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ & Soul continued , and I had a contract to co-write a self-help book aimed at Black parents .\nWithout a doubt , I was a role model for Black women \u2019 s health and wellness .\nBecause I was in the public eye \u2014 and lecturing others in print and in person about the importance of health education and taking care of yourself \u2014 I was extremely careful to practice what I was preaching .\nI exercised nearly every day , adhered to a low-fat , high-vegetable diet , drank a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once a year for a medical checkup and tests .\nSo , it came as a total shock that though I had been doing everything right , something went wrong in the early months of my pregnancy .\nFirst I had a near miscarriage , and my doctor \u2014 a Park Avenue OB-GYN and female friend whom I trusted implicitly \u2014 put me on bed rest .\nAfter that first crisis was averted , she discovered that like Naia , Heather Miller \u2019 s baby , my baby was far smaller than her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was in excellent health .\nMy OB-GYN sent me to a specialist , where I was diagnosed with a condition called intrauterine growth restriction ( IUGR ) , generally associated with mothers who have diabetes , high blood pressure , malnutrition , or infections including syphilis , none of which applied to me .\nDuring an appointment with a perinatologist \u2014 covered by my excellent health insurance \u2014 I was hounded with questions about my \u201c lifestyle \u201d and whether I drank , smoked , or used a vast assortment of illegal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this doctor think I \u2019 m sucking on a crack pipe the second I leave the office ?\n\u201d In the absence of a medical condition , IUGR is almost exclusively linked with mothers who smoke or abuse drugs and alcohol .\nAs my pregnancy progressed , but my baby didn \u2019 t grow , my doctor decided to induce labor just short of one month before my due date , believing the baby would be healthier outside my body .\nMy daughter was tiny , born at 4 pounds , 13 ounces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though she would grow to be a bright , athletic , healthy young woman , I wondered if the less than healthy environment inside my uterus that had endangered my baby \u2019 s life might have had something to do with stress .\nHad my own lived experience as a Black woman in America been bad for her birth weight ?\nIn the mid-1990s , I was part of a study and its advisory board that hoped to answer this question .\nA team of female researchers from Boston and Georgetown Universities had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigations of women \u2019 s health overwhelmingly comprised white women , so they launched the Black Women \u2019 s Health Study ( BWHS ) .\nThe investigators contacted me at Essence to help recruit subjects , and I also signed on as one of 59,000 participants .\nThey were interested in looking at a large group of Black women over time , taking the approach of the Nurses \u2019 Health Study .\nThat long-term investigation , conducted by researchers from Harvard Medical School and other institutions and funded by the National Institutes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 120,000 educated , largely healthy women with access to medical care .\nHowever , the study \u2019 s pool of subjects lacked diversity ; the first cohort of nurses was 97 % white .\nSeveral years into the study , the BWHS investigators decided to examine the health effects of not just race but racism .\nIn 1997 , they added

you \u2019 ve got affirmative action.\n\u201d At Stanford , Miller studied psychology but fulfilled her science requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was almost dissuaded from pursuing medicine after an adviser told her she probably wasn \u2019 t smart enough to be premed .\nIn med school at the University of Southern California , the aggressions turned from micro to macro .\nSome of the instructors and attendings made it clear that neither Black students nor Black doctors were as smart as their white peers .\nMiller remembers sitting in the cafeteria with a group of her white classmates and an attending pointing out that the only reason the dozen Black students \u2014 out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2003 \u2014 had made it to med school was affirmative action .\nThe feeling of invisibility and erasure was stark and the pressure immense .\nShe felt terrified of making any mistake , because she would never be given the benefit of the doubt .\nThough she considered pediatrics , ultimately Miller chose OB-GYN .\nDuring her four-year residency between 2003 and 2007 , she was attacked with a toxic mix of racism and sexism .\nShe calls the program malignant .\n\u201c If you were a woman who wasn \u2019 t traditionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ or ] spoke with an accent , the mainly older white men who ran the residency treated you horribly , \u201d she recalls .\nOver the years , she has been part of several OB-GYN practices , all but one time as the only Black person and sometimes the only woman ; the Association of American Medical Colleges reports that only about 2.6 % of physicians are Black women .\nIn her current practice in Minneapolis , where she is still the only Black doctor , but one of several women , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of patients , the slights continue to grate .\nBeginning in the early years of her medical career , she knew always to wear her white coat and introduce herself as Dr. Miller , to lock in her legitimacy .\nOtherwise , patients and even colleagues would assume she was a nurse or receptionist .\nEven after identifying herself as Dr. Miller and spending half an hour examining a patient and discussing a procedure , a patient might ask , \u201c When will I talk to a doctor ?\n\u201d Or , \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Other times , after completing her rounds , a patient would complain , \u201c I never saw a doctor.\n\u201d Miller pauses after going through the inventory of mistreatment and listing the insults .\nShe describes the pain of being undervalued and erased , and the isolation of a lifetime of being an \u201c only , \u201d often forced to represent the entire race in all-white spaces .\n\u201c Sometimes , I would know that something wasn \u2019 t right or that I was being mistreated , \u201d she says .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share it with .\nWhen you try and explain it to someone who doesn \u2019 t understand what you \u2019 re going through , they tell you you \u2019 re being sensitive , or imagining it or making it racial .\nIt \u2019 s very confusing and isolating to not have people around who allow you to feel yourself or comfortable in your own skin.\n\u201d That constant vigilance , coping , and suppressed anger takes a toll .\nFor Miller , stress manifests itself as splitting headaches that throb hard and hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling as wearing ; I immediately think of weathering .\nResearch conducted by Drs .\nDavid and Collins as well as the investigators behind the Black Women \u2019 s Health Study has shown that something about being a Black woman in America is bad for her body and her baby .\nTaking it a step further , Arline Geronimus , a professor at the University of Michigan School of Public Health , provides the best current explanation of how lived experiences can become biology .\nI spoke to her extensively when conducting research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mothers and babies and we have stayed in touch .\nHer concept of weathering explains that high-effort coping from fighting against racism leads to chronic stress that can trigger premature aging and poor health outcomes .\nIt works this way : Stress , the body \u2019 s response to a perceived threat , prompts the brain to release hormones , including adrenaline and cortisol .\nThis , in turn , causes blood pressure to increase and the heart rate to speed up .\nShort , infrequent bursts of this fight-or-flight response are normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , it can turn deadly , eroding health and accelerating aging .\nAlso , as the stressors pile up and feed on each other , they can lead to unhealthy coping mechanisms \u2014 drinking , smoking , poor food choices , and drug use .\nThose who are economically disadvantaged have added stressors in their day-to-day fight for survival , but even educated , well-off African Americans struggle with anger and grief triggered by everyday racist insults and microaggressions .\nThese can , over time , deteriorate the systems of the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c weathering , \u201d chose this metaphor , leaning into its double meaning .\nTo weather means to wear down , but it also means to withstand , as in weathering a storm .\nThough discrimination and bias wear away the bodies of those who must continually beat them back , she notes that the positive forces of family , friendship , and community support can help a person withstand , resist , and undo the negative effects .\nAnd while chronic stress interferes with the health of an average person , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is already a stress test for the body , and the added and cumulative strain of fighting against racial bias and discrimination , and its weathering effect , far too often turns what should be the happiest day of a woman \u2019 s life into tragedy or near tragedy .\nBlack women , more frequently than other women , enter pregnancy with health disadvantages ; studies have found that disproportionate numbers of African American women of childbearing age , in their twenties and early thirties , already suffer from chronic diseases , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other Americans later in life .\nThough the vast number of Black women have healthy pregnancies and babies , Geronimus and others believe that the cumulative impact of battling back racism drives up their risk of preterm birth , low birth weight , and infant and maternal death .\nHeather Miller , her husband , her son , and her mother , Avril , who has relocated to Minneapolis , love little Naia fiercely and are doing everything they can as a family to correct what happened to her at birth .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to complain , not to look back , not to blame others , not to be weighed down by regret , but instead to put her head down , work relentlessly , and soldier ahead .\nBut she does wonder , as I do , if something about being a Black woman in America affected her body and her baby .", "author": "Linda Villarosa", "url": "https://capitalbnews.org/excerpt-under-the-skin-black-maternal-health/", "published": "Thu, 07 Apr 2022 12:00:00 +0000", "published_utc": 1649347200, "collection_utc": 1649375703}, {"id": "capitalbnews--2022-04-08--Talking About COVID-19\u2019s Racial Disparities Makes White People Care Less.

about inequities could reduce concern and perpetuate unintended harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Family Foundation shows that Black adults are more vigilant about COVID-19 precautions .\nMore than 60 % said they masked every time when inside public places in the past 30 days , and 20 % indicated they mask most of the time .\nIn comparison , less than 20 % of white adults said they used a mask every time

about labeling history and systemic inequities as unjust , she said .\nKnowing that large systems , such as health care institutions and socioeconomic class , impact health outcomes might also help

Dr. Carla Williams , an associate professor of medicine and public health at Howard University .\nHow the study \u2019 s participants received information about the systems at play mattered .\nWhen

majority of Black adults have had at least one negative experience with a health care provider , according to a new report .\nBut young Black women are particularly likely to report a harmful interaction during routine health care .\nMore than 70 % of Black women ages 18 to 49 said they \u2019 ve experienced at least one negative interaction with care providers , including dismissal of their pain or having to speak up to get proper care .\nYoung Black women also are most likely to prefer seeing a Black doctor , expressing that health care providers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at looking out for their best interests and treating them respectfully .\nThe finding was one of many in a Pew Research Center study that analyzed Black Americans \u2019 perspectives on science , including medicine , health care , STEM education and science-related news .\nResearchers highlighted the nuanced views Black adults hold about scientists and the health care system .\nOf the more than 14,000 participants , Black adults made up about 3,500 including those who identify as single-race , multiracial , and Hispanic .\nAmong Black women , \u201c a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d said Cheryl Clark , an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School .\n\u201c They don \u2019 t always feel that their symptoms are taken seriously.\n\u201d And the impact is dire .\nAcross the United States , Black women are three to four times more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications than white women .\nAmid the coronavirus pandemic , the crisis has grown .\n\u201c It \u2019 s really important to take a look at what young Black women are saying about their caregiving experiences if we want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clark , who is a physician at Brigham and Women \u2019 s Hospital in Boston .\nThe study also found that Black Americans \u2019 trust for medical scientists has dropped since November 2020 , a trend similar to the general public .\nAmong white adults , the decline has been particularly significant .\nAccording to the study , there is now little difference in how white , Black , and Hispanic adults view medical scientists , a shift from prior surveys in which white adults were more likely to report high confidence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black adults report believing that serious medical misconduct is just as likely today as it was in the past , although those with more knowledge of the work medical researchers do were more likely to view them positively .\nIn the survey , researchers highlighted the Tuskegee experiment , during which Black men were intentionally denied treatment for syphilis beginning in the 1930s , as an extreme breach of trust .\nBut individual interactions with the health care system may have an even larger impact , said Darrell Hudson , a health disparities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis .\nStories told within families and local communities about which hospitals mistreat Black patients erode trust in health and medicine .\n\u201c There are individual , patient-provider-level interactions , things that I \u2019 m not even sure providers are aware that they do that might be read as dismissive or might be seen as disrespectful , \u201d he said .\n\u201c Those reinforce the notion that these people don \u2019 t care about us.\n\u201d Respondents \u2019 perceptions that their pain is being dismissed is supported by research on those experiences .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ University showed that Black emergency room patients were 40 % less likely to receive pain medication than white patients .\nStill , in the Pew Research study , a majority of Black respondents expressed that their provider was either excellent or very good during their most recent visit .\nThat \u2019 s an indication that trust is complex , Hudson said .\n\u201c People might not have a great deal of trust for the health care system , maybe they don \u2019 t trust the vaccines , but they have a really good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nConsidering all the factors that influence health , more than 60 % of Black adults believe less access to quality medical care in their neighborhoods is an important reason why Black Americans face worse health outcomes .\nThat perception , experts say , tends to match reality .\nNeighborhood segregation persists across the country , said Dr. Gbenga Ogedegbe , director of NYU \u2019 s Institute for Excellence in Health Equity .\n\u201c Forget race and ethnicity \u2014 your ZIP code is a major predictor of your life expectancy , \u201d he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor neighborhood , \u201c your chances of living longer are much lower than if you live in a rich neighborhood.\n\u201d The density of hospitals is higher in wealthier neighborhoods , said Ogedegbe , and resources dwindle in less rich neighborhoods .\nAt the same time , \u201c health is more than health care access , \u201d said Hudson .\n\u201c Do people actually have the access to the things that they need to follow doctor \u2019 s orders ?\n\u201d The survey also explored the feelings of STEM \u2014 or science , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professionals and their education experiences .\nAmong those working in STEM , half of Black college graduates recalled mistreatment in their schooling , more than any other racial group .\nBlack students \u2019 rate of mistreatment \u201c probably is higher , \u201d said Ebony McGee , an associate professor of diversity and STEM education at Vanderbilt University .\nShe noted how overly praising Black students for getting the right answer may feel like they believe in students , but , from a racial lens , might equate to them not expecting Black students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stereotypes .\n\u201c In STEM courses , we \u2019 re not told about racial microaggressions , \u201d she said .\nA majority of Black respondents also said they believed more youth would pursue careers in STEM if they saw more high achievers in the field who looked like them .\nMcGee noted that representation of Black scientists and engineers provides more than inspiration .\nRacial bias and the belief that Black skin is more resilient to pain and trauma affects how medicine is provided to Black Americans , she said .\nFor example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels in the blood , are less accurate in Black patients .\nThe NFL \u2019 s past \u201c race norming \u201d practice , which assumed Black players had lower cognitive function than white players , influenced the dementia tests used to determine payouts in a brain injury settlement .\nAnd the algorithms used to calculate kidney function take the patient \u2019 s race into account , adding a \u201c race correction \u201d that , in some cases , bumps Black patients lower on the transplant list .\nBetter representation in STEM could safeguard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c It \u2019 s really life

Drew University of Medicine ; and Dr. Ndidiamaka Amutah-Onukagha , founder of MOTHER lab and assistant dean at Tufts University School of Medicine ; to talk about the ways America struggles to serve Black women during the critical postpartum period .\nHere \u2019 s a snippet of their conversation ( this selection has been edited for clarity and length ) Shefali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation just by getting the lay of the land of what \u2019 s behind these persistent and really profound discrepancies between Black women and white women when it comes to both postpartum care and outcomes .\nDr. Amutah-Onukagha , can we start with you .\nDr. Ndidiamaka Amutah-Onukagha : We know that 63 % of maternal deaths are preventable and that , honestly , the health care system is so fragmented and so racist inherently in its nature , that the needs , the priorities , the symptoms , the responsiveness to Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it needs to be .\nThis is why we see people slipping through the cracks .\nWhen you hear statistics like 90 % of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage are preventable , then you \u2019 re wondering how is it that 9 out of 10 people that die from hemorrhage are dying in a country like the United States , in a country with the resources that we have , the technology , the excellent training of these clinicians .\nThat tells you there \u2019 s more to the story than technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do clinically .\nThere has to be something more .\nThat \u2019 s where racism plays out .\nThey call it implicit bias .\nI call it explicit racism .\nJennie Joseph : For me , I \u2019 ve been in the United States 32 years and I \u2019 m absolutely still horrified because there is no postpartum [ care ] .\nPostpartum barely exists .\nWhat frustrates me more than anything about our care system as far as postpartum , is that we have this little two-day window that families are supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ready for because after two days in a hospital environment , you \u2019 re tossed out .\nYou \u2019 re on your own .\nYou \u2019 re put back into the community where there are , really , no resources for you .\nThe most upsetting and egregious part of our outcomes , our maternal morbidity , and mortality are that the majority of them take place in the postpartum .\nHow ridiculous is that ?\nWe know where the problems lie and yet our efforts are going towards continually ignoring this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I \u2019 m based out of Cuba , which has mama-leave , daddy-leave , and grandparent-leave .\nAnd grandparents are considered the first supporters of a family and get the support and the training and education they need to be able to start at the family level , to be the one that \u2019 s eyeballing someone who has just had a baby and supporting them .\nIn the sense we \u2019 re looking at pregnancy in a vacuum , we are developing it all by ourselves without looking at what the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it is really a detriment to us because we are behind every developed country in the world in the policies that drive the services that we get .\nAmutah-Onukagha : The way that our system is set up , as we \u2019 re talking about the United States and how we operate in such a silo and a vacuum , and we are so tone-deaf to what \u2019 s happening in other parts of the world .\nThere \u2019 re so many beautiful practices and beautiful things that are really beneficial to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are things already in play , but what we haven \u2019 t achieved here in the United States , is an ability to take policy and transfer it into action .\n[ That \u2019 s ] an imperative if we are going to see any changes in our outcomes for Black and other marginalized folk .\nHere \u2019 s the problem : When we put these policies in place , we don \u2019 t have any providers , or we \u2019 re not willing to create the providers to carry this work forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about it .\nThe workforce is able to be developed , but we just keep choosing not to develop the workforce .\nWe already have enough research that points out the impact and the value of doulas , community health workers , resource mothers , peer counselors .\nWe don \u2019 t have any need for any more research before we move ahead .\nAmutah-Onukagha : It \u2019 s not that we don \u2019 t know what to do .\nWe have to put procedures in place that have teeth , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don \u2019 t want to be in any more governing boards , or coalitions , or commissions , just for the purposes of showing up in the room and eating good food and talking to people that already understand the problem .\nWe are here to move the work forward .\nWhile we \u2019 re here patting each other on the back with all our accolades , people are dying .\nWe \u2019 re missing opportunities to save lives and to really interrupt how racism is showing up in the health care system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifts , women are facing drastic changes to reproductive health care access .\nBlack women are among the most affected by these changes .\nCapital B CEO and co-founder Lauren Williams talked with Planned Parenthood CEO and President Alexis McGill Johnson about what the future holds .\n( This quote has been condensed for length and clarity . )\n\u201c What we see in a state like Texas , and many copycat bans across the country , is an effort not only to deny access to sexual and reproductive health care \u2014 after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also the criminalization .\nThe increased surveillance and the policing of the Black body is what we \u2019 ve been fighting for over 400 years .\nOur ability to make decisions about our own bodies becomes particularly acute for Black women .\nWe have the Supreme Court , where we are awaiting a decision in a case called Dobbs v. Jackson Women \u2019 s Health , which is a 15-week ban [ on abortion ] in Mississippi .\nAgain , that \u2019 s another state that \u2019 s predominantly Black , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor , maternal health outcomes in particular are poor .\nAlso , [ it has implications for ] outcomes for children and foster children in the state .\nAnd here you have a 15-week restriction that the Supreme Court has taken up .\nAnd the way they took it up goes directly to the heart of Roe : Who gets to make the decision [ about abortion ] pre-viability .\nAnd we know , if the court lets that law stand , it will create a ripple effect .\nWe \u2019 re starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced across the country that will expedite the end of Roe in 26 states .\nWe \u2019 re talking about 36 million people who could be impacted by this law , people who could become pregnant .\nAt the center of that are Black women who disproportionately bear the brunt of relentless attacks , not just on access to abortion , but bodily autonomy .\nWhat we see people having to [ do ] in Texas and other states : having to secure child care , to secure resources , to secure days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of state thousands of miles to get access to basic health care that they should be able to get in the state .\nWe always know that when other communities have a cough , we have a full-on flu .\nI think that \u2019 s exactly what we are likely to see at this moment as we await the Supreme Court decision.\n\u201d \u2014 Alexis McGill Johnson In light of the dire statistics around maternal health , Sona Smith , the Birth Justice program officer at the Ms. Foundation for Women , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CEO of MAJAICA LLC , joined Capital B to discuss some of the potential solutions and resources available to birthing families .\nJackson noted that her years of research have centered the mental health experience of Black women \u2014 who , thanks to the intersection of gender and race , are predisposed to conditions like depression and anxiety .\nOne of the most important resources that can help ?\nCommunity .\nJackson said that resources coming from the community as well as a broader commitment to birth equity provide significant benefits to women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stressors of race , resources , health , and pregnancy all at once .\nSmith said that she , too , sees community and community-based resources as a tremendous contributor to better outcomes \u2014 but notes that often smaller , grassroots community organizations struggle to get the resources and funding to adequately address the needs of their communities .\nSolving that gap , they note , will be critical to bridging the divide in pregnancy disparities .\nClosing out the day , Simone Sebastian , editorial director of Capital B , talked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wright Rigueur , author and historian at Brandeis University , about the many positive sides of being a Black mother even in the face of such difficult statistics and social uncertainty .\nBelow , the pair share their most surprisingly joyful part of parenthood : Helena Andrews : I think the joy that came at the beginning was just in being pregnant and being on this new journey .\nEspecially as professional Black women , you \u2019 re just on this grind .\nIt \u2019 s like checking it off the list .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and now I \u2019 m pregnant .\nJust being in my pregnant body in and of itself was a joyful experience for me , even though my pregnancies very much aligned with a lot of the renewed attention \u2014 necessary attention \u2014 [ on the ] Black maternal morbidity rate .\nThat was happening literally as I was baking a child , and yet I still was able just to find a lot of joy in my body .\nLeah Wright Rigueur : The moment that someone \u2019 s like , \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , here you go.\n\u201d I \u2019 ve written about this before ; my reaction has always been laughter because it \u2019 s such a wonderful moment .\nIt feels like a celebratory moment .\nAnd then the other thing that I think took a little bit of getting used to , that actually brings me so much joy , is the development of my children as individuals with their own likes , personalities , and independence .\nThey \u2019 re so different from one another .\nAnd they \u2019 re so different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has been just amazing to look at them and say , \u201c Wow , you \u2019 re like your own little you .\nYou have likes , you have dislikes.\n\u201d So nobody really told me about that , about how these personalities come out so quickly .\nAnd I just feel very lucky to be entrusted with guiding them through the process of them discovering themselves .\nThey \u2019 re going to do it on their own , but I just feel really incredibly fortunate that I get to watch

"Concentration of Oil and Gas Drilling in Black Neighborhoods Is Deliberate, Study Suggests", "content": "For decades , state governments and private companies have asserted that oil production sites were chosen solely by natural factors : where oil was most abundant , easiest to drill , and cheapest to procure .\nBut a new study by researchers at the University of California , Berkeley identifies more pernicious motivations , suggesting that social factors \u2014 namely race \u2014 played a major role in the location of oil production .\nThe study , published in the Journal of Exposure Science & Environmental Epidemiology , compared the locations of more than 10,000 oil drilling sites in 33 cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predominantly Black neighborhoods .\nThe research found that formerly redlined communities are home to roughly twice as many oil and gas drilling sites as non-redlined , predominantly white communities .\nNotably , the findings indicate that more sites began to pop up after redlining began , suggesting a deliberate practice of placing toxic oil production in communities of color .\n\u201c We saw the greatest disparities among people living near oil wells in Black communities , \u201d said David Gonz\u00e1lez , the study \u2019 s lead author and an environmental scientist at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is a clear pattern , \u201d he added .\n\u201c While oil drilling was happening before redlining , the bulk of oil production has happened since it began .\nIt is a manifestation of structural racism.\n\u201d Black people are 75 % more likely than white people to live next to polluting sites , such as oil refineries or coal plants , according to a 2017 report from the NAACP and Clean Air Task Force .\nMore than 1 million Black Americans are exposed to the invisible forms of pollution from oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water pollution .\nAnd oil drilling takes place throughout the country , from California to Oklahoma and even in Detroit .\nThe impacts on the climate are concerning , too .\nMethane , regularly emitted from oil wells , has climate impacts that are 25 times as potent as carbon dioxide .\nThe impacts can be deadly .\nLiving near sites of oil and gas drilling has been linked to higher rates of cancer , heart disease , severe respiratory illnesses , and depression .\nIt also contributes to a major health impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Proximity to oil and gas wells is linked to birth complications , including preterm births , neural tube defects , and adverse reproductive outcomes , such as increased maternal mortality rates .\nIn California specifically , where the 2017 report found that more than 100,000 Black people live within a half-mile of an oil production site , one study concluded that women living in high-volume oil well areas were 40 % more likely to have an infant weighing less than 5.5 pounds , which is linked to higher rates of illnesses and developmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drilling locations in cities in 13 states across the South , Midwest , and Northeast .\nThe study was inspired by Gonz\u00e1lez \u2019 s grandfather who grew up in a redlined community of Los Angeles , which is home to the largest concentration of

population \u2014 live within a half-mile of an oil production site , according to the 2017 report from the NAACP and Clean Air Task Force .\n\u201c The life expectancy of residents in toxic areas is significantly lower , \u201d Littlejohn said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even spend relaxing time outside without concerns about air quality.\n\u201d She noted that basic needs like transportation are complicated by air pollution and the prevalence of oil drilling .\n\u201c People in these areas are less likely to have cars , which means they rely on public transport or walking , \u201d Littlejohn said .\n\u201c Then , walking increases exposure to toxic air.\n\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez , the lead author , connects the prevalence of oil drilling in Oklahoma \u2019 s Black neighborhoods in Oklahoma City

talking to newsmakers from across the country who want to reshape American politics or galvanize Black voices in government .\nOur \u201c Voices of Change \u201d series will update periodically with insights from the candidates , activists , lawmakers , and political insiders who you should know .\nAs the only Black elected chief prosecutor in California , Diana Becton took the role in 2017 with a plan to \u201c shake up this office.\n\u201d Since then , she has attracted attention for doing things differently in the Contra Costa County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped prosecuting low-level drug crimes and established a drug diversion program .\nShe launched a \u201c conviction integrity unit \u201d to review questionable cases , resulting in one man \u2019 s exoneration .\nShe filed felony manslaughter charges against a police officer who fatally shot an unarmed motorist , leading to the first conviction of an on-duty officer in the county \u2019 s history .\nIn 2019 , she partnered with the Vera Institute of Justice to review patterns in the office \u2019 s charging decisions , \u201c with an aim to ending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system.\n\u201d The goal of all these reforms , she said , is to be \u201c smart on crime \u201d by focusing on those who are committing the most violent offenses .\n\u201c You can \u2019 t clog up the entire system with all of these misdemeanor cases , \u201d Becton said .\nThe current system offers few alternatives to incarceration , she noted , \u201c especially for those who might be suffering from drug addiction and mental illnesses.\n\u201d Becton , 70 , is part of the wave of progressive prosecutors who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promises to reform the criminal justice system .\nMany are now facing tough reelection campaigns amid growing concerns about crime rates nationwide .\nBecton \u2019 s opponent in the June election is one of her own deputy district attorneys , Mary Knox , a 37-year veteran of the office .\nKnox blamed Becton following a smash-and-grab at a local Nordstrom \u2019 s in November , saying her reform measures have allowed criminals to go free .\nShe objected to Becton \u2019 s drug diversion program and was against the successful prosecution of former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the East Bay Times .\nKnox also filed a gender and age discrinination case against Becton in 2019 along with four other female prosecutors who allege that Becton \u201c promoted and assigned supervisory roles to significantly less qualified and less experienced men.\n\u201d Becton , who previously served as the president of the National Association of Women Judges and Contra Costa County Superior Court judge , spoke to Capital B about the challenges of reforming the criminal justice system and campaigning for reelection amid crime fears .\nThe interview is edited for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With growing fears about crime , what approach is your office taking to protect the community at large while providing defendants fair treatment ?\nDiana Becton : One of the things I always talk about is the fact that it really is not an either/or .\nIt \u2019 s very often [ prosecutors ] get accused , if you \u2019 re doing progressive work , we get accused of then not protecting the community or not protecting the rights of victims .\nI like to say it \u2019 s an \u201c and.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussions about smash-and-grabs .\nIn my county , we made the national news , because of the 90 people that stormed the Nordstrom store all simultaneously , going through separate entrances , creating alarm within our community about safety .\nBut the thing about the message I send is that we are holding those accountable who are committing serious and violent crimes in our community .\nSo , for example , with the smash-and-grabs \u2026 there \u2019 s district attorneys up and down the state , we were immediately on the phone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to coordinate our resources because we recognize that the people who are committing these crimes were traveling from county to county .\nSo I immediately partnered with six counties all the way down to San Joaquin and Santa Clara County on up north , and we also partner with state and federal and local law enforcement so that we \u2019 re bringing the best intelligence and prosecution information so that we can hold those accountable for the smash-and-grab .\nAlso , every single person that has been apprehended , we have charged and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accountable .\n\u2026 And we coordinate our resources with federal and local law enforcement .\nWe concentrate on those who are using guns and violence in our community so that we can really be smart on crime , and we \u2019 re focusing our attention on those who are committing the most violent crimes .\nI \u2019 ve established the cold case unsolved homicide unit , especially with the advancements in technology and DNA .\nWe \u2019 ve been able to solve cases that lay unsolved for many , many , many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work with law enforcement agencies to take a look at bringing justice to the family .\nI \u2019 ve established [ a ] human trafficking unit , so we are focusing on those who are abusing people in our community for labor or for sex .\nSo community safety is always the number one priority , but it doesn \u2019 t mean that I am investing less in the important work of trying to reduce our footprint with mass incarceration , and it certainly doesn \u2019 t mean that I \u2019 m not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fairness and racial disparities in our system , as well .\nSo I say it \u2019 s always an \u201c and.\n\u201d Yes , we \u2019 re here making sure that we \u2019 re doing what we need to do for community safety , and making sure that we \u2019 re also keeping up our work with the Vera Institute , and they \u2019 re helping to take a deep dive into our data and our decision-making with an aim toward really ending racial and implicit biases in our justice system .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ me for the definition of community safety .\nYou established a Conviction Integrity Unit in your office and have at least one exoneration so far this year .\nExplain the importance of having a unit like this , and do you think the exoneration of Jermaine Dickerson is the first of many to come ?\nCreating such a unit , it was following a progressive trend around the country .\nInvestigating prior convictions , it \u2019 s important to seek justice for those who may have been wrongfully convicted , and also to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where there may have been significant integrity issues .\nThose are all areas that the unit takes care of .\nWe don \u2019 t have a lot of staff there , we only have one attorney there .\nA little bit slow going , but we certainly are hopeful that as we go forward , there will be more and more cases where we will be able to overturn .\nHow important was it for you to start a drug diversion program ?\nWhat were you seeing in your community that this needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you seeing ?\nMeasuring success is a little bit of a challenge for us right now .\nAnd we \u2019 ll talk about how I \u2019 m trying to stand up my portals so that we can have readily available data to be able to answer those questions .\nIn terms of the drug diversion , it really stems from a broader conversation about an understanding that there \u2019 s certain things that we just simply can not prosecute our way out of , and drug addiction is one of them .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ who happen to suffer from addiction , it really just becomes a revolving door .\nOn top of that , it really also bogs down our courts with so many cases , misdemeanor cases , that really don \u2019 t necessarily have anything to do with the safety of our communities .\nThat is why it was important for me to say that people are being cited solely for the possession of small amounts of drugs , that we will divert them away from the criminal justice system , and actually refer them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the whole idea was to reduce the strain on our courts and our law enforcement , but also to provide treatment options as a better solution for community safety .\nBlack residents make up less than 10 % of the population in your county , but what role do you see them playing in your reelection bid ?\nCertainly , the Black vote and the Black community \u2026 is extremely important because a lot of the policies and procedures that I \u2019 m putting into effect are really ones that are redefining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd so clearly , their vote and their support is extremely important .\nBut in this county , I also have to have a message that resonates across color .\nThe thing about Contra Costa County is that people are recognizing that they do have to use facts over fear \u2026 because we go after the violent crime .\nIf my community is saying , \u201c Oh my god , she was not prosecuting violent crime , \u201d that would just be a big untruth .\nBut people are all up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And what I have to keep reminding people about is , all of the issues of quality-of-life stuff \u2014 homelessness , mental illness and drug addiction \u2014 we can \u2019 t prosecute our way out of those problems .\nAs a community , as a public safety issue , we have to find a different path for those kinds of cases .\nGo to the entire community to bring this new definition of public safety , and one that also has to have a lens of equity and fairness \u2014 and has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footprint on mass incarceration and also reduce our racial and ethnic disparities \u2014 and so those are the messages that I think are so important , and they resonate across the board .", "author": "Christina Carrega", "url": "https://capitalbnews.org/diana-becton-voices-of-change/", "published": "Tue, 26

government in addressing environmental issues .\n\u201c I found myself in a moment where I was both anxious and really frustrated because we saw politicians fall into old ways , \u201d Odega said .\n\u201c They got more comfortable saying it was OK for communities like mine to be overburdened with diesel pollution or refineries .\nThey resorted to treating the climate crisis as a future problem.\n\u201d While that crisis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an explosion of young changemakers .\nOdega \u2019 s climate anxiety drove him to run for a seat representing district 15 on the Los Angeles City Council .\nLos Angeles council members are arguably some of the most powerful local politicians in the country : There is one council member representing every 265,000 residents in the city .\nBy comparison , in New York City , there is one council member per 165,000 people .\nIf elected in November , Odega will be the first non-white representative of one of Los Angeles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ districts .\nWithin the borders of the district , which includes the historic Black neighborhood of Watts , 82 % of residents are people of color and 25 % live in poverty .\nThe roughly 15-mile long strip of land includes the city \u2019 s highest number of polluting sites , the third-largest oil drilling field in the country , and the most significant port complex in North America .\nWith $ 400 billion worth of trade goods and roughly $ 600 million of revenue flowing through the district every year , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industries have dictated the area \u2019 s political willpower since it was annexed by Los Angeles roughly 100 years ago .\nTaking cues from successful progressive campaigns across the country , Odega is running on a staunch anti-establishment platform .\nHe \u2019 s vowed not to accept money from corporations , fossil fuel companies , real estate developers , or police associations .\nHis biggest opponent , Tim McOsker , a white businessman and former Los Angeles Police Department union lobbyist , has spent more than four times as much money as Odega @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidates combined .\nOdega \u2019 s district , which has the fourth-largest Black population of the city \u2019 s 15 wards , has one of the lowest voter turnout rates in the city .\nIn the last council election without an incumbent , just 18 % of registered voters cast a ballot .\nThe area \u2019 s white residents , which make up roughly 18 % of the population , have had an outsized say in elections .\nCapital B caught up with Odega at a coffee shop along Los Angeles \u2019 port @ @ @ @

this race ?\nBryant Odega : My organizing around environmental justice brought me into this race .\nThe 2016 election made me realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it was .\nIt led me to the organizing world , where I \u2019 ve been building continued relationships in my community and organizing with the Sunrise Movement to connect class and race to our environmental issues .\nBut , the most radicalizing moment for me was seeing the United Nations \u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report in 2018 , which proved that we are racing toward climate catastrophe .\nI realized if we didn \u2019

brown communities in this district by people who did not share our lived experiences .\nThey were threatening our health and worsening the climate crisis .\nBillions of dollars move through this district every year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even global \u2014 importance .\nHave you been actively considering the local-national connection during your campaign ?\nPeople tend to gravitate to national politics because that \u2019 s what gets the most attention in the media , but in Los Angeles , the connection makes sense naturally .\nThis is one of the biggest and most important cities in the country , and just 15 people represent the 4 million people living here .\nThe LA City Council can have the power to change public discourse and opinion a lot quicker and easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the national level , if we want to see more funding and support for public transportation , affordable housing , health departments , energy and water infrastructure , or phasing out drilling , we need leaders here who are able and willing to show that these progressive policies work .\nHistory shows that national policy will follow .\nYou have explained the governing power within the Los Angeles City Council and the sheer economic power of your district ; what does it mean to have a candidate like you who wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this public office will become 100 % accountable to the people in this city and not the economy .\nAcross the country , there are many examples like this district , where Black and brown folks are laboring for millions of dollars to be brought in for corporations and the government but never see that funding being distributed back to them .\nWe want to make sure how taxpayer dollars are being spent is guided by our communities and not by police unions or corporate lobbyists .\nIs it easier to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your district because you \u2019 re a Black working-class person ?\nYou know , I \u2019 d say it \u2019 s complicated .\nIt \u2019 s both a blessing and a struggle .\nStruggle in the sense that because I am coming from an underrepresented position in politics , I \u2019 m going up against an entire machine of political dynasties

positive impact , and I think it \u2019 s easier for me to make that impact because of the life I \u2019 ve lived .\nI watched ICE separate my father from my family .\nI \u2019 ve had to work multiple jobs before to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only renter on City Council in a city where 60 % of people are renters .\nAll of that matters to people .\nDo you think what actually matters to everyday people is appropriately represented in the political sphere ?\nNo , and that \u2019 s a major challenge .\nThe people traditionally engaged and reached through policy in Los Angeles \u2014 and everywhere for

effects of redlining , and we live in an internet desert .\nBecause of the way this city developed , many people don \u2019 t realize they \u2019 re able to vote in Los Angeles city elections .\nIt is not by accident that big business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies control politics here .\nHow does that change ?\nIs true political representation achievable in this electoral system ?\nBy building people power .\nWe \u2019 re bringing organizing tactics to this electoral field , forcing the conversation , making demands , and uplifting public pressure .\nChange will not come from nicely asking our politicians or the top executives to stop polluting our neighborhoods , or by asking the police to stop killing us .\nChange requires a lot of public pressure and organizing , which means listening

public transit .\nIn Detroit , Monczunski notes , car culture and the expansion of highways have led to the devastation and displacement of many Black communities .\nDetroit People \u2019 s Platform

Lurie Children \u2019 s Hospital of Chicago , where she often treats infants with feeding difficulties and digestion issues .\n\u201c Feeding your child is one of the fundamental things , as a parent , that people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re going to get formula from , or if you can get formula , has been very stressful for families.\n\u201d And for families whose children require specialized formulas , the stakes mount .\n\u201c Some of the formulas are made for kids with a variety of different medical conditions .\nSome children may have difficulties breaking down the proteins that are in milk or are simply allergic to different products in the milk , \u201d said Cohran .\n\u201c This resulted in some kids even getting admitted to the hospital until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children.\n\u201d The cost of cans , particularly the specialty products , add additional barriers for parents .\n\u201c Some families were unable to pay the money \u201d to get substitutes , said Cohran .\n\u201c Some of these formulas can cost thousands of dollars a month.\n\u201d The shortage reflects larger systemic issues that perpetuate disparities persistent across health care .\n\u201c There are these bigger systemic issues that are leading to both the disparity in breastfeeding and the compounded impact that this shortage might be having on Black families , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the University of South Carolina \u2019 s College of Nursing .\nShe \u2019 s calling for more comprehensive regulations on formula production to prevent recalls and combat future shortages , she said .\n\u201c Policies , instructions and processes need to be addressed , \u201d she added .\nThe systemic issues Felder describes , along with medical racism and targeted marketing , are among the reasons why Black parents might be more likely to opt for formula over breastfeeding .\n\u201c Some of it is racism in the medical field , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Breastfeeding , Race , and Injustice .\n\u201c When [ Black parents ] are in the hospital , the baby \u2019 s given formula without being asked or they \u2019 re in a hospital that doesn \u2019 t encourage breastfeeding.\n\u201d She also cites other factors such as limited parental leave from work and paid breaks for feeding or pumping .\nAnd then there \u2019 s the history of formula companies marketing to Black parents , a trend that began in the 1940s with the Fultz sisters .\nThe identical Black quadruplets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quads \u2014 were delivered in North Carolina in 1946 by a white doctor who conducted vitamin C experiments on them and then negotiated a deal with the milk company , Pet Evaporated Milk , to feature the children in formula advertisements .\nThe ads , which the girls appeared in until their teenage years , explicitly targeted Black consumers , who , until that point , were not loyal consumers of formula .\nThe ad campaign , unique in that it was marketing something other than alcohol , tobacco , or beauty products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous success for Pet Milk , as Freeman wrote in Skimmed .\nIt convinced Black women that formula was an equal , or even better , alternative to breast milk .\nIt \u2019 s history that experts say bleeds into the high rates of formula use within Black communities \u2014 one that is linked to the current shortage .\nAnd it \u2019 s one with no immediate solutions .\nPediatricians and health experts have warned against parents making their own formula , diluting what they have to make it last longer , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which can be dangerous to babies or lack necessary nutrients .\n\u201c When you dilute formula , you not only dilute the nutrients , you dilute the different electrolytes that are in the formula and it may cause health problems for the child , \u201d said Cohran .\n\u201c I can see how families would consider diluting it , but that can be very dangerous , particularly for a younger infant.\n\u201d Without reliable workarounds , and with the threat of no formula on the shelves , parents are left with few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Until formula production is back on track , the best thing to do is consult with your pediatrician on the most appropriate alternatives when formula isn \u2019 t an option , Cohran said .\n\u201c All of this needs to be done under the care of your health provider .\n\u201d", "author": "Margo Snipe", "url":

a lack of economic investment .\n\u201c This is a historical tragedy , is what it is , \u201d Brian Harris said Tuesday , as he shopped at a Tops market nearly three miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still considered a crime scene .\n\u201c This is something from way back ; a system that was set up to oppress and keep us down , even in 2022.\n\u201d As in many Rust Belt communities , Buffalo \u2019 s Black community grew in the early to mid-20th century with the rise of the Great Migration , as families moved North in an effort to escape the oppression of Jim Crow South and secure jobs in the steel and coal boom .\nBut as they arrived , Black residents were locked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , barred by redlining practices from purchasing homes in well-resourced areas , and relegated to the city \u2019 s toxic corridor .\nMore than half a century later , nearly 85 % of Buffalo \u2019 s Black residents live in the city \u2019 s economically-depressed East Side , an area that has been called ground zero for lead poisoning and environmental racism .\nLongtime resident Rev .\nDiann Holt was among the wave of new Buffalonians as a child , moving from Manchester , Georgia , after her father got a job at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember while growing up when the community was at least 90 % Black , \u201d Holt said as she drove down the block where she recalled residents fetching water from a

but would not sell [ to us ] in the suburbs , \u201d Holt said .\nLast year , the city of Buffalo was presented with an opportunity to \u201c right some of the wrongs \u201d \u2014 as one state official put it \u2014 of its segregationist history .\nA yearslong investigation , ordered by then-New York Governor Andrew Cuomo , examined the discriminatory housing policies used against the city \u2019 s Black community and found that less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Buffalo region were made to people of color , though they comprised about 20 % of the population .\nWhile the report offered policy solutions , little has changed .\nBlack homeownership rates in Buffalo still lag far behind the national average .\n\u2018 Finally , I Got My Own Supermarket \u2019 As Black residents were concentrated on the city \u2019 s East Side , resources dwindled , including food options .\nIn the early 1980s , a local entrepreneur launched FIGMOS , a community market whose name stood for \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d In an interview at that time , FIGMOS owner Douglas Goggins told The Buffalo Challenger newspaper that \u201c People in the community are in great need of a supermarket within their reach .\nThe community is crying for someone to care , \u201d according to a documentary about the market .\nFIGMOS closed two years after opening its doors .\nFour decades later , Black Buffalo continues to struggle with the realities of living in a food desert , an area with little access to healthy food options .\nSome residents prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nod to the history of segregation here .\n\u201c A desert is something that is natural , it is something that you have absolutely no control over , \u201d Holt said .\n\u201c So what we have is not a food desert , it \u2019 s apartheid .\nIt is deliberate discrimination against someone because of their race.\n\u201d In 2003 , Tops Friendly Markets opened its Jefferson Avenue location , where Saturday \u2019 s shooting occurred .\nBut many residents without cars are left heavily reliant on corner stores for fruits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wrinkling , they say .\n\u201c If you go out to the suburbs , you can get a nice , crispy green pepper .\nYou go to the Tops over here and they \u2019 re withered up , \u201d said Della Miller , a 73-year-old resident who said she doesn \u2019 t remember a time when quality fruits and vegetables were readily available in the neighborhood .\nMiller , who has been active in food justice and access issues in East Buffalo for decades , said her mother once sold food on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to travel across town to get fresh produce .\n\u201c We have not had a decent food source for years , and we worked for years to get to where we are now , \u201d Miller said of the Tops grocery store .\n\u201c Now we \u2019 ve lost that.\n\u201d Since the shooting , Tops has provided shuttles to take residents to a store in a more affluent part of town .\nBut some said they don \u2019 t feel comfortable shopping there and are stared at by other customers .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a grocery store for this neighborhood \u2014 it was a community center , a place of belonging .\n\u201c It \u2019

comfort in other stores.\n\u201d Rather than take the shuttle across town , 83-year-old Estelle Miller walked to a community center on Wednesday where food boxes were being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jefferson Avenue Tops multiple times a week , calling the neighborhood store a \u201c godsend.\n\u201d A lifelong resident of the area , Estelle Miller said she notices a significant difference in accessibility of food in her neighborhood compared to the more affluent Elmwood community next door .\n\u201c I think a lot of people in the area feel like there should be more grocery stores , \u201d she said

1960s severed access to banks , parks and other city institutions and left residents exposed to more traffic pollution than 90 % of the country , according to a database by the White House Council of

residents \u2019 homes have been slow to make progress , according to the Investigative Post , a nonprofit news source covering western New York .\nBut Buffalo \u2019 s leaders have continued to funnel more money into another resource : policing .\nSince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at three times the rate of all other city departments , the Investigative Post found .\nDays before the mass shooting , the mayor proposed another $ 3 million increase for the department .\nOvertime and bonuses for police amount to more than the city allocates collectively for parks , recreation and community services , the investigative news outlet reported .\nLikewise , a 2019 analysis by the Vera Institute of Justice , a national criminal justice organization , found that in Erie County , where Buffalo is located , nearly 650 times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as employment services , and more than 130 times as much is spent on incarceration than on housing assistance .\nSpokespeople for Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown and city council member Ulysees Wingo Sr. said they weren \u2019 t available for comment .\nAccording to recent data from the Buffalo Police Department , crime rates have gone down every year since 2008 and reports of hate crimes are no greater than the rest of the country .\nDuring the last five years , there have been 33 hate crimes reported to the Buffalo Police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blacks , according to the FBI \u2019 s Crime Data Explorer \u2014 a rate lower than the rest of the country .\nBut the city \u2019 s attempt to suppress violent crime \u2014 and increase in police funding \u2014 has not fared well with Buffalo \u2019 s Black community .\nIn a 2016 survey of more than 2,000 residents , community group Open Buffalo found that less than half of Black respondents said they trust the police ,

this month .\nWhile the agency improved its oversight of lead testing in states that regularly monitor their water systems , it didn \u2019 t create a uniform system to ensure all states are properly monitoring for lead contamination , the inspector general audit determined .\nThe report also found that the department has not addressed issues in its system that allows residents to report water

researchers have concluded .\nIn response to the watchdog report , the EPA told Capital B News that it \u201c appreciates the work \u201d of the inspector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed to using every tool

knocking on more than 2,000 homes throughout the city to warn residents that their lead service lines have not been replaced .\nThe community , she says , has had to fill the gaps left by the

crisis and the risk of reintroducing waterborne diseases eradicated in the country .\nLast November , the federal government earmarked $ 55 billion to replace lead service lines and upgrade the

determining which communities need the funding because there is no maintained map of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discriminatory housing policies , lead water lines are known to be concentrated in Black and Latino communities .\nA 2020 study found that race , namely being Black in America , was a bigger risk factor for lead poisoning than poverty or poor housing .\nBlack children , the study concluded ,

Flint was shaken , and that sense of peril may have created the conditions for learning challenges , \u201d said Brian Jacob , a professor at the University of Michigan , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s school district is disproportionately filled with students with special needs .\nWhile fighting to ensure clean water in Flint , Mays and other activists have also advocated for public and mental health

"The nation \u2019 s most recent school shooting \u2014 which left 19 fourth-graders and two teachers dead in a Texas classroom \u2014 has again forced parents to question their children \u2019 s safety .\nWhile gun violence has become a near-universal fear for Americans , children from underrepresented backgrounds often are most susceptible .\nCapital B spoke with Charity Brown Griffin , a researcher at Winston-Salem State University in North Carolina and a licensed psychologist who works with children , about the effects of school shootings on children \u2019 s psyches and how race and class can impact the ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightly edited for clarity and length .\nCapital B : When a child experiences something as traumatic as a school shooting , what long-term effects does that have on their development ?\nCharity Brown Griffin : It has huge implications .\nWhen we think about whether or not you have the direct experience or vicarious trauma \u2014 which means you hear about it or you see it experienced by someone else , even if it doesn \u2019 t happen directly to you \u2014 we know , from research , it has implications for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And if you think about PTSD , what some of those symptoms are , you \u2019 re thinking about avoiding certain locations and thinking about where the particular trauma may have happened .\nSo if it happened at school , the anxiety that you may feel about going into a school building , you may now avoid certain places or things that may remind you of it .\nThey may be on high alert , very jumpy , very easily angered because of having experienced or witnessed or observing the trauma .\nWe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSo that includes feelings of hopelessness , you can see depression , and sometimes , for some students , just sort of a more general self-destructive outlook as a result of experiencing or witnessing trauma or hearing about it .\nNot every child will experience a school shooting , but they do hear about it in the news .\nTheir teachers or their parents may bring it up or sit down and talk to them about it .\nThere are students who are now going through drills in classrooms on what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could that also affect a child \u2019 s development ?\nIf kids are chronically exposed to this type of stress where they \u2019 re heightened , they feel jumpy , they are seeing these images .\nThey \u2019 re really fearful about entering their school building or the school spaces .\nIt can certainly have a neurological impact .\nThere \u2019 s been research documenting changes to several regions of the brain that are involved in learning and behavior .\nI now have to practice this drill where I have to then think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if someone comes into the building with a gun , how am I , as a child , supposed to respond .\nThe most recent school shooting , which took place at Robb Elementary School in Texas , is an area where the vast majority of the student population is Hispanic .\nMost of these students come from an economically disadvantaged community .\nWhat additional obstacles do marginalized students have when it comes to processing trauma , compared to their white peers ?\nWhat we see is too many young children who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd when we think about the intersection of that marginalization , because of their race or social class , there is the potential then for them to be exposed to a host of adverse factors .\n[ Black and brown ] communities can also be disproportionately affected by gun violence .\nThey don \u2019 t have the particular resources needed to help provide the goods and services for the residents of the community : access to health care , particularly mental health care .\nThey \u2019 re not centered on policy issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and voices are often not valued in the same way as their white counterparts .\nBlack children are more likely to be killed by a gun than any other racial group in the U.S. A recent Washington Post analysis found a 39 % jump in gun deaths for Black youth in 2020 \u2014 and another 13 % increase in the first 10 months of 2021 .\nHow do we explain just how susceptible black children are to gun violence ?\nWhen we think about Black people in our country , they do bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd I think we have to look at the disparity .\nThis disparity is a result of centuries of oppression and disinvestment .\nSo when we think about gun homicides , assaults , police shootings , all of these things occur at a disproportionate rate in historically underfunded communities .\nWe know that crimes are often crimes of proximity .\nSo when we think about what poverty has done , and what divestment in certain communities has done again , when people don \u2019 t have access to a living wage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunities for community improvement , health care , mental health care \u2014 we see this multilayered level of oppression , right ?\nWhat can parents do to be on the lookout for their child ?\nWhat sort of signs of mental duress should they be looking for ?\nKeep the line of communication open with your child .\n\u201c What made you sad today , or did anything make you sad today ?\nWhat made you angry today , or did anything make you angry today ?\n\u201d As your child gets older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online presence , it is important to be attuned to what your child is being exposed to .\nHaving that conversation about mental health can help destigmatize it .\nYour child may want to talk to somebody about what they \u2019 re experiencing .\nKids are facing real issues in their school building and in the community .\nIt may require the support of a mental health professional to help them navigate that , and that \u2019 s fine .\nIt doesn \u2019 t mean that you \u2019 re a bad parent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job as a parent .\nBecause it does take a village .\nAnd your child may need multiple support systems in place to help them thrive .", "author": "Giulia Heyward", "url":

financial hardship .\nBut the nation \u2019 s infant formula shortage has put her on the front lines of an \u201c unimaginable \u201d crisis , she says , one that \u2019 s hitting rural , low-income parents particularly hard .\nWhite recalls one mother who traveled from a rural part of the state to pick up formula from White \u2019 s nonprofit , Power in Changing , after making several unsuccessful stops at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her preferred formula brand in stock at a CVS , but had to leave the drug store empty-handed because it did not accept WIC , the federal food subsidy she uses to feed her baby .\n\u201c It \u2019 s sitting there right within her reach , \u201d White said .\n\u201c That was a heartbreaking moment for me .\n\u2026 A lot of parents are finding it not only difficult to find [ formula ] on the shelves , but they have to go to stores with people who aren \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they \u2019 re fighting amongst each other.\n\u201d Months of limited supplies of infant formula have left families nationwide scrambling to find food for their babies .\nSome infants have even been hospitalized , including at least four in South Carolina .\nIn addition to supply chain disruptions , a formula recall by Abbott Nutrition , the largest infant formula manufacturer in the country , in February exacerbated the shortage .\nThe crisis has been particularly acute in rural areas , where retailers have suffered from extensive shipping delays and residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find stocked shelves .\nAdvocates say WIC \u2014 formally known as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women , Infants , and Children \u2014 has created yet another hurdle for rural families , who heavily rely on the government program because the benefits specify what type of infant formula they can buy , how much and from where .\nStates authorize certain retailers to accept WIC benefits , and companies bid to become a designated formula provider for each state \u2019 s program .\nCombined with the shortage , those regulations severely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families can access with their benefits , advocates say .\n\u201c If the shelves were empty , or they were limited [ in what parents could buy ] , they couldn \u2019 t pick up the amount they wanted , \u201d said Chelesa Presley , director of the Diaper Bank of the Delta in Clarksdale , Mississippi .\n\u201c A lot of women are wondering how they \u2019 re going to feed their babies.\n\u201d More than 6 million people nationwide receive benefits from WIC and they purchase about half of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is overseen by the United States Department of Agriculture , provides food and breastfeeding support to low-income families with children up to age 5 who meet federal poverty guidelines and are deemed at nutritional risk .\nParticipants receive monthly benefits to purchase certain foods .\nBut the formula shortage has brought new scrutiny to the WIC program , revealing how its limitations can hamper food access , particularly for rural families .\nEarlier this month , the USDA encouraged states to waive certain restrictions on formula purchases , allowing WIC participants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wider variety of vendors .\nOn May 21 , President Joe Biden signed the Access to Baby Formula Act , which allows the USDA to waive restrictions and provide easy access to baby formula for WIC recipients in emergency situations like the current shortage .\nAdvocates say that the additional flexibility has been helpful for families .\nOther initiatives , such as allowing parents to receive their benefits remotely instead of driving to the nearest WIC clinic , also have helped in rural areas , said Geraldine Henchy , director of nutrition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center , a nonprofit research organization .\n\u201c WIC had to change its rules so that people could buy more different kinds of formula with their WIC benefits , \u201d Henchy said .\n\u201c The federal rules , the waivers , allow states to be pretty expansive as far as the formula shortage is concerned.\n\u201d But the waivers are a temporary fix , and rural health advocates say government officials should do more to prioritize access to formula in rural areas .\nNearly 90 % of U.S. counties with the highest rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are rural , according to Feeding America , a nonprofit food bank organization .\nAnd about 46 % of rural , income-eligible families with young kids participated in WIC .\nEligible Black families account for 21 % of program participants .\n\u201c Rural areas are often the last to get the supply chain issues fixed , so it \u2019 s really important that the [ federal government ] moves as quickly as possible and under-resourced communities are not ignored , \u201d Henchy said .\n\u201c Because the same kind of systemic discrimination that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and supply chain problems to start with are at play here.\n\u201d Irene Bean , a family nurse practitioner in Nashville , Tennessee , said she has patients on WIC who have driven three to four hours searching for baby formula .\nSome parents poured extra water in the formula to preserve food , but this decreases the nutrients that babies need , Bean said .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve had mothers having to take their babies to the hospital because they \u2019 re not receiving the nutrients required for their age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s so heartbreaking to know that , one , I don \u2019 t have enough money to purchase the formula that I actually need if I can find it .\nAnd number two , the gas prices have skyrocketed , so I \u2019 m driving three to four hours to get two or three cans for my baby .\n\u2026 It \u2019 s something that really needs to be looked into.\n\u201d In recent weeks , the federal government has used its emergency powers to address the formula shortage , even beyond WIC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Production Act to speed up the manufacture of baby formula and authorized Operation Fly Formula to import infant products that meet U.S. standards .\nDespite the progress , the federal Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Robert Califf said his agency \u2019 s food safety division responded too slowly to a whistleblower report about safety failures at the Abbott plant , The Wall Street Journal reported .\nBefore the shortage , people were already struggling to make ends meet , living in food deserts , and paying higher food costs because of inflation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps the federal government and states are taking are necessary , and the federal waivers should be extended to help rural families long-term .\n\u201c We just need to be really clear that everything possible needs to be done to make sure that people have the choices that they need to make on these government programs like WIC , \u201d she said .\n\u201c To the extent there \u2019 s a recovery in terms of this supply shortage , that it \u2019 s equal and there \u2019 s equity in how it \u2019 @

reports that a school resource officer had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they now say that officer wasn \u2019 t even on campus when the gunfire began .\nThe Uvalde tragedy is another notch in a growing tally of grievances behind some people \u2019 s calls for the removal of police officers from schools altogether .\nThose calls also followed the Parkland , Florida , shooting in 2018 , when a police officer retreated to safety as a gunman killed 17 people inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School .\nAs many as 20,000 officers are estimated to be working in schools across the country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Resource Officers , though there \u2019 s no national database that tracks them .\nAs scrutiny of police officers in schools grows , here \u2019 s what you should know about those tasked with protecting classrooms \u2014 and why some people want them out .\nWhen did police officers start working in schools ?\nThe practice of employing full-time police officers on school grounds isn \u2019 t new \u2014 but their popularity across the country is .\nSchool resource officers , as they \u2019 re often called , can be employed either by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department .\nLos Angeles became the first to employ police officers on its school grounds in 1948 , when school desegregation began there , according to David Canton , director of the African American studies program at the University of Florida .\nSchools hoped police officers would help mitigate fighting between students from different racial groups , Canton said .\nThe practice gained traction over the years as other cities introduced officers onto their campuses , including nearby Fresno , California , and Flint , Michigan .\n\u201c During the \u2019 50s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the country , \u201d said Canton , who is an associate history professor .\n\u201c You had youth culture : young people , teenagers with cars .\nThey had money ; they had some time on their hands.\n\u201d The next major shift in the use of school resource officers occurred in 1999 , after two students killed 12 classmates and a teacher in Columbine , Colorado .\nMore schools began hiring law enforcement , some viewing it as a way to improve relationships between students and police .\nBut most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with predominantly Black and Latino populations , a trend that suggested \u201c that Black and brown children are inherently more aggressive , more violent , \u201d Canton said .\nIt depends on who you ask .\nLaw enforcement agencies generally maintain that school resource officers can prevent school shootings from happening in the first place .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve had many situations where SROs \u2014 through good relationships \u2014 have gotten invaluable intelligence from students , parents , and educators that have given them information they can use to conduct an investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d said Mo Canady , executive director of NASRO .\n\u201c And that doesn \u2019 t get talked about enough.\n\u201d A 2021 analysis of prevented attacks logged by the Averted School Violence database found that most of the plots were initially discovered by peers of the suspect .\nSchool administrators were the next most common reporters , followed by school resource officers .\nCivil rights groups , teachers , and families point to several high-profile cases in which officers did not adequately respond to school shootings .\nThe Texas Department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school district \u2019 s police department responded to the school shooting .\nThe same criticism occurred after news that a police officer at the Parkland , Florida , high school remained outside the building as the gunman attacked students and staff .\n\u201c You can do all the training you want , folks were not prepared , folks fear death , \u201d Canton said .\n\u201c Because they know the damage AR-15s can cause , whether you \u2019 re wearing a bulletproof vest or not.\n\u201d Do school resource officers contribute to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other advocacy organizations argue that the presence of police at schools is particularly threatening for Black students , because research shows officers disproportionately arrest children of color .\nBlack students made up 36 % of arrests during the 2015-2016 school year , despite accounting for just 15 % of the student body , according to a 2020 report from the Justice Policy Institute .\nThe same report found that schools where Black and Latino students make up 25 % to 50 % of the population had a higher rate of SROs compared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 % of the population .\n\u201c Allowing police officers to handle all infractions , including minor infractions that in other times would have been handled by a school administrator , needlessly marks a student \u2019 s first contact with the criminal justice system , \u201d said Shekhinah Braveheart , an advocacy associate at the Justice Policy Institute and a former schoolteacher .\n\u201c In fact , it normalizes contact with the criminal justice system , potentially setting up that kid , or those children , for a lifetime of collateral consequences.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit from providing other resources \u2014 such as mental health counseling \u2014 to help students with behavioral issues , rather than immediately getting the police involved .\n\u201c We need real resources , like psychologists , counselors , nurses , \u201d Braveheart said .\n\u201c People who can help children create a nurturing , safe environment , so people can feel safe .\nThe only tool a police officer has is to arrest \u2014 what else can he do ?\n\u201d What should I be paying attention to next ?\nIn response to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of the country are considering employing more officers onto school grounds , or arming teachers with guns .\nMost recently , several rural school districts in Texas announced that they are considering arming its school staff .\nA new law in Kentucky is requiring every kindergarten through 12th-grade school to employ a school resource officer by fall .\nSome districts ended their school policing programs or reduced their budgets in the aftermath of the 2020 racial justice protests , some of which demanded to \u201c defund the police.\n\u201d In some cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health services in schools , including in Los Angeles .\nBut other places rejected public calls to remove school resource officers from their campuses .\n\u201c The reality is that there are some schools that are really unsafe , and there are some very dangerous altercations that take place , \u201d Braveheart said , adding that \u201c Having mental health professionals on duty is a solution , but it just takes longer to see the fruit of that .\n\u201d",

President Joe Biden addressed the country in a televised primetime speech Thursday to advocate for policy solutions and urge lawmakers to \u201c finally do something \u201d about the nation \u2019 s gun violence epidemic .\nFollowing the massacres of 10 Black people in New York , 19 children in Texas and four employees at a hospital in Oklahoma , Biden told viewers that the Second Amendment is \u201c not absolute.\n\u201d He called for raising the minimum age to purchase a firearm from 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and passing \u201c red flag \u201d laws that allow authorities to temporarily limit gun access for people who pose a threat to themselves or others .\nBiden is also calling for a ban of assault-style rifles and high-capacity magazines .\nThe gunmen behind the New York and Texas shootings were 18 years old , and while too young to buy alcohol , they purchased their assault-style rifles legally .\nThe now-deceased Texas killer made at least two trips to a firearms dealer and seamlessly purchased long guns shortly after his birthday .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an AR-15 style rifle hours before he killed two doctors and two others on May 31 before he died by suicide .\n\u201c Guns are the number one killer of children in the United States of America .\nThe number one killer .\nMore than car accidents .\nMore than cancer , \u201d Biden said Thursday , sourcing a recent U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report .\n\u201c For God \u2019 s sake , how much more carnage are we willing to accept ?\nHow many more innocent American lives must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 ?\nEnough.\n\u201d After every senseless mass shooting , some lawmakers utter the overused phrase of \u201c thoughts and prayers \u201d while others demand stronger gun laws .\nAs lawmakers teeter-totter in Congress , Black and brown communities continue to fall victim to gun violence disproportionately .\nAmerican deaths from gun-related injuries rose to the highest level on record in 2020 , the most recent data available from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .\nThe agency reported that more than 45,000 people were killed \u2014 54 % were suicides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men were far more likely to become victims , with a rate of nearly 35 firearm-related deaths per 100,000 people .\nBlack women also had higher rates of death than women of other races and ethnicities .\nMost alarming , 9.5 out of every 100,000 Black children and teens were killed with a gun \u2014 \u201c a rate four times higher than the rate for White children and teens , \u201d according to 2015 data analyzed by the Children Defense Fund .\nA Black child or teen was killed with a gun every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report found .\nWhile background checks have dominated the gun-control conversation , other solutions also are getting attention .\nHere \u2019 s a look at a few that anti-violence advocates and elected officials have been touting : Gun buyback programs have been implemented in cities across the country , including communities in New York , Chicago and Boston .\nThe don \u2019 t-ask-don \u2019 t-tell systems allow anyone to walk into a designated location and turn in any form of an operable or inoperable firearm in exchange for a monetary amount .\nThese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the 1970s .\nIn 1974 , more than 13,000 guns were turned in in Baltimore over a three-month period , for $ 50 each .\nThe programs are usually held in collaboration with local prosecutor offices and police departments .\nFor example , the Brooklyn District Attorney \u2019 s Office along with the New York City Police Department have hosted several gun buyback events over the past decade , and at one event collected close to 300 weapons .\nBrooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said his office has conducted two gun buyback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant engagement with communities to prevent violence is bearing fruit.\n\u201d Gonzalez said in a statement leading up to the office \u2019 s second gun buyback event that shootings in Brooklyn have decreased \u201c by nearly 25 % so far this year , following a 20 % drop in 2021.\n\u201d The event resulted in 69 recovered firearms \u2014 the largest collection under Gonazlez \u2019 s leadership , according to Oren Yaniv , a spokesman for the prosecutor \u2019 s office .\nThe May 21 event took place at Emmanuel Baptist Church in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered $ 200 bank cards and an iPad per gun or assault rifle , while supplies lasted .\nParticipants who turned in rifles , shotguns , and air guns received $ 25 per gun , up to a maximum payout of $ 600 .\nThe first event netted 39 weapons .\nIt \u2019 s a drop in the bucket when considering that there are more guns circulating in the U.S. than there are people .\nAccording to the Small Arms Survey , there are an estimated 393 million privately owned guns nationwide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThere \u2019 s little information to show that gun buyback programs have been effective in combating gun violence in the U.S. , because they \u201c have occurred infrequently and on a relatively small scale , \u201d according to Gun By Gun , a nonprofit organization that advocates for gun buyback programs .\nBut the group noted that a mandatory gun buyback program in Australia in the 1990s , which pulled more than 600,000 guns off that country \u2019 s streets , was followed by a substantial decline in homicides and suicides .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. also could counteract efforts to reduce the prevalence of firearms on American streets .\nIn an op-ed this month for the New York Daily News , Gonzalez expressed concern that his office \u2019 s efforts to reduce gun-related crimes may be in vain if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns a New York state law that \u201c restricts the concealed carrying of handguns to those who can show a special need.\n\u201d \u201c The court \u2019 s decision , which would impact more than 80 million Americans in states with similar laws , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of legal guns , exacerbating already unacceptable levels of violence , \u201d he wrote .\n\u201c More guns in our urban neighborhoods would be especially devastating to Black and Brown communities , who already suffer disproportionately from gun violence.\n\u201d While officials debate gun laws and attempt to reduce weapons on the streets , community activists have used boots-on-the-ground efforts to raise awareness and prevent gun violence .\nEvery first weekend in June , in recognition of National Gun Violence Prevention Day , people across the country wear orange while participating in demonstrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that started in remembrance of 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton , who was fatally shot in 2013 on a Chicago playground .\nIn Georgia , 100 Black Men of Atlanta Inc. relaunched an anti-gun violence campaign in April that uses billboards and social media awareness , as well as collaborations with the public school system , to drown out the sound of gunshots with a flood of messaging against gun violence .\nThe Black Child Legacy Campaign , based in Sacramento , California , was established after a 2013 Blue Ribbon Commission report found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70 % of Black children who were killed by a third-party ( someone other than their primary caregiver ) .\nThe organization launched efforts to provide job training , violence prevention , and community service for \u201c high risk \u201d youth .\nThe BCLC touts the work of the Office of Neighborhood Safety in Richmond , California , which reported a 71 % reduction in gun violence between 2007 and 2016 by using individuals who were once in the criminal justice system as \u201c neighborhood change agents \u201d who intervene when interpersonal conflicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent violence .\nIn New York City , the 14-year-old community organization Save Our Streets ( S.O.S . )\nalso has used a boots-on-the ground approach to reduce conflict and all forms of violence , which organizers say contributed to a reduction in shooting victims in the Bronx .\nAs with mass shootings , there are typically red flags that proceed street violence , said James Brodick , director of community development and crime prevention for the Center for Court Innovation , which operates S.O.S .\nThat \u2019 s when members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have built trust , step in to defuse the situation before police get involved .\n\u201c The people who shoot are getting younger and younger , which is really unfortunate , \u201d Broderick said .\n\u201c They don \u2019 t understand the ramifications of what they \u2019 re doing or they feel such a sense of hopelessness that they \u2019 ll say , \u2018 I had nothing to lose and actually the gun is giving me power in my community.\n\u2019 \u201d Brodick said communities need to provide young people with more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have nothing to lose , but everything in life to experience and gain .\n\u201c Until we make long-term , deep investment in addressing issues around trauma , addressing issues around economic mobility , we \u2019 re going to have the same conversations over and over and our communities will continue to be overpoliced , \u201d Brodick said .\nGuns that were legally or illegally purchased or trafficked contributed to more than 19,000 homicides in 2020 , according to the CDC .\nHistorically , when a product has been found to cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is taken off the shelves or recalled \u2014 yet federal law prevents gun manufacturers from being held liable if their product is used in a crime .\nOn Thursday , Biden called for repealing the immunity that protects manufacturers and gun retailers from being held liable .\nBiden said he also believes gun owners should be held responsible if they haven \u2019 t kept their firearms locked away in a safe , as in the case of Ethan Crumbley , whose parents were also charged for giving their son easy access to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a Michigan high school .\nThere are signs that a shift could be coming .\nIn 2019 , the U.S. Supreme Court gave the families of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre the greenlight to sue Remington , the gun manufacturer of the rifle used by the gunman .\nThis February , the company settled the lawsuit with the families of 20 first-graders and six teachers victimized by the shooting for $ 73 million .\nThe families told The Associated Press that their focus was \u201c on preventing future mass shootings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible with their products and how they market them.\n\u201d Gun violence not only affects the victims directly involved with a shooting \u2014 it financially impacts the broader community , which picks up the tab for medical bills , mental health care , and other consequences .\nEverytown for Gun Safety , a nonprofit gun violence prevention organization , published a study in February 2021 that found that \u201c federal , state , and local governments are spending a combined average of $ 34.8 million each day to deal with the aftermath of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adrine , a board member with anti-violence organization Futures Without Violence , said he hopes the Supreme Court will continue to move in the direction of accountability for the damage guns cause , but \u201c given the direction that this Supreme Court is going in , I don \u2019 t hold out a lot of hope in the short term.\n\u201d When lawmakers offered \u201c thoughts and prayers \u201d after Sandy Hook , Adrine said he \u201c pretty much gave up hope \u201d that any gun control laws would ever happen in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this carnage is going to get to the point where the vast majority of American citizens , who have already let it be known that they want some sort of common sense approaches to gun control , will assert themselves and form some kind of organization or movement that will actually be able to counterbalance the passionate organization of the small number of folks who want no gun control , \u201d said Adrine , a former municipal court judge based in Cleveland .\nBut , he added , \u201c Until that happens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything that \u2019 s going to turn this around.\n\u201d This story has been updated to reflect

in Florida , white students at a middle school took a photo holding up letters that spelled a racial slur .\nBut the cases all happened in the past year as students have returned to school , bringing incidents of racial bullying with them .\nWhen the pandemic forced classrooms online , schools experienced a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of in-person bullying incidents .\nBut the behavior didn \u2019 t stop \u2014 it merely continued online .\nAnd as students returned to classrooms , a dizzying number of high-profile , racist incidents reemerged across the country .\nThe trend is likely to

by 49 % from the previous year .\nSome experts think that this led to a similar spike in behavior among children and adolescents .\n\u201c You saw on the news , on different outlets , people kind of modeling the racial discrimination , \u201d said Brendesha Tynes , an education and psychology professor at the University of Southern California , who studies online racial discrimination .\n\u201c Young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OK thing to do around racial issues , right ?\nThis is how you behave toward people who look differently \u2014 towards Black folks.\n\u201d The phenomenon is more commonly experienced by Black students in predominantly white schools , said Griffin , an assistant professor of psychological sciences at Winston-Salem State University .\nHer research shows that Black students attending these schools are more likely to hear racial slurs used by white classmates and feel socially excluded .\n\u201c For Black students , many of them in these predominantly white spaces don \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhen the pandemic shuttered in-person learning , it seemingly offered a reprieve from bullying .\nA recent study found that internet searches for school bullying and cyberbullying fell by 30 % to 40 % when schools switched to remote instruction in 2020 .\nThis trend continued into the next school year as well .\n\u201c We weren \u2019 t surprised to see school

lightly edited for clarity and length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech you gave come together ?\nWhat sort of planning did you do ?\nBecky Pringle : I first listened .\nI actually went down to Houston , Texas , a couple of weeks ago , to do a press conference and rally outside of the NRA [ National Rifle Association ] , with our teachers and students .\nI was joined by one of our teachers who survived Sandy

was better than doing right.\n\u201d Shockley was eventually convicted in the manslaughter death of a store clerk and received a second felony conviction for rape at age 31 .\nAmerica \u2019 s detention centers \u2014 rife with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a system that worsens prisoners \u2019 mental health and perpetuates crime , even outside of their walls , prison reform advocates say .\nFederal investigations have revealed patterns of constitutional violations and civil rights offenses across the country that undermine the correctional system \u2019 s professed goal of rehabilitation .\nIn Georgia , federal officials are investigating state prisons where dozens of homicides and suicides have been reported since 2020 .\nIn Texas , the Department of Justice has launched an investigation into five juvenile facilities amid allegations of physical and sexual abuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restraints and isolation .\nIn Alabama , the DOJ \u2019 s civil rights division has filed a lawsuit against the state , saying it \u201c fails to provide safe and sanitary conditions , and subjects prisoners to excessive force at the hands of prison staff , \u201d violations that have led to \u201c homicides , rapes , and serious injuries.\n\u201d The US incarceration rate has been declining for more than a decade , but the land of the free continues to lead the world in putting its residents behind bars .\nBlack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state prisons at five times the rate of white Americans .\nNear the nation \u2019 s peak level of incarceration in 2008 , one in every nine young Black men was locked up .\nIncarceration is one of the most glaring examples of how fragile freedom can be for Black Americans .\nThe 13th Amendment made America \u2019 s brand of mass incarceration possible by abolishing slavery \u201c except as a punishment for crime.\n\u201d That loophole has allowed correctional institutions to dehumanize those in their custody , often crowding them into heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell blocks and work for pennies .\n\u201c It wasn \u2019 t until we started to criminalize Blackness more that we started to see more of a dehumanization take place within these correctional facilities , \u201d says Nneka Jones Tapia , former executive director of the Cook County Department of Corrections .\n\u201c That 13th Amendment clause , I think , is an articulation of the fear that we in America have always had of Black and brown people.\n\u201d For those like Shockley \u2014 whose 1982 life sentence for rape left room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of parole \u2014 correctional institutions need to reframe their approach to be rehabilitative rather than punitive , reform advocates say .\nThat means focusing on the trauma that often underlies criminal behavior and treating it , while finding ways to keep nonviolent people out of prison altogether .\n\u201c Prisons aren \u2019 t working , \u201d says Fritzi Horstman , founder of Compassion Prison Project , a nonprofit organization focused on humanizing incarcerated individuals .\n\u201c Prisons should not be for punishment , they should be for healing , because if you realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why would you continue to traumatize them ?\n\u201d Horstman created a short program series called \u201c Trauma Talks , \u201d in which incarcerated people fill out a questionnaire that identifies their types of adverse childhood experiences ( ACEs ) , such as emotional or sexual abuse , physical or emotional neglect , and mental illness .\nThe program provides tools that encourage healing through breathing , writing , meditation exercises , and group discussions .\nThe talks are not considered therapy , Horstman says , but rather an awareness campaign to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand the root causes of their violent behavior and adjust to avoid recidivism .\nAwareness of one \u2019 s childhood traumas isn \u2019 t meant to excuse bad behavior , she said .\nIt \u2019 s an opportunity to take responsibility for one \u2019 s actions and develop coping mechanisms to better control them .\n\u201c A lot of people in prison don \u2019 t want to take accountability because it makes them feel like they \u2019 re wrong , and it brings up their shame , \u201d Horstman says .\n\u201c But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u2018 Look , I \u2019 m human , I did something wrong.\n\u2019 \u201d The program launched in September at Valley State Prison in California and Horstman hopes to expand across the country .\nShockley , like many participants in Trauma Talks , said he has experienced at least one form of adverse childhood experience .\nGrowing up Black with a record during Jim Crow meant that society put him in a box that labeled him a criminal , he says .\nHe was given no tools for a second chance through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was a person who was out of control , not realizing the trauma that \u2019 s involved with my acting out .\nThey really deemed me as inhumane and not worth being rehabilitated , \u201d Shockley says , adding that he was sent to a mental health professional whose questions weren \u2019 t helpful .\n\u201c Instead , they should have asked , \u2018 Did anybody molest you ?\n\u2019 \u201d he says .\n\u201c That would have been a fair question to ask.\n\u201d Not only have most incarcerated people experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , most correctional officers have , too .\nBut the \u201c us-versus-them \u201d culture indoctrinated in prisons for generations prevents cooperation toward a shared goal of community safety .\n\u201c Even though these two groups \u2014 correctional officers and people incarcerated \u2014 have these experiences that are very common and rooted in trauma , the system teaches them to see each other as different , \u201d she says , noting that correctional officers are trained in military-style tactics .\n\u201c When we see people as \u2018 the other , \u2019 that \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we see happening in correctional facilities.\n\u201d Tapia serves as the managing director of justice initiatives for Chicago Beyond , an organization that funds and coordinates with grassroots organizations that target various inequities in communities of color , including education , health , and youth safety .\nHorstman acknowledges that the rehabilitative approach she advocates isn \u2019 t a panacea .\nShe believes \u201c probably about 3 to 5 percent of people \u201d in prison can \u2019 t be helped because of conditions that limit their ability to \u201c see people as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most cases , criminal behavior isn \u2019 t innate \u2014 it \u2019 s learned , and the prevalence of juvenile detention has something to do with it .\nLike Shockley , 68 percent of people in state prisons were first arrested before their 18th birthday , according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics 2016 report \u2014 long before one \u2019 s cerebral cortex is fully developed .\nThe numbers are worse for Black Americans : 76 percent of incarcerated individuals \u2019 first arrest was before the age of 18 .\nSome advocates say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young person is held in detention is unjustifiable .\nCPP \u2019 s Trauma Talks workbook states that \u201c when the brain is developing , it is adjusting to the world and acquiring new skills for survival and adaptation .\nIf growth is taking place in an unstable , stressful and traumatizing environment it affects a child \u2019 s ability to think , learn , decision-make , play and build healthy relationships.\n\u201d Through accountability , compassion , and healing , Horstman and Tapia say that rehabilitation is possible for a large majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safer work environments for staff .\nBut the commitment of correctional facility administrators to operating under the status quo is preventing progress , they say .\n\u201c We have to look beyond those military-style practices to think about recruiting people with expertise in mental health , with expertise in social work and education , so that they come into the job with a different mindset , one that \u2019 s rooted in healing and helping individuals and not one that \u2019 s rooted in control , \u201d says Tapia , whose father was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during her childhood .\n\u201c We must humanize those who are incarcerated .\nThey \u2019 re not just what they \u2019 re charged with .\nThey are mothers , fathers , daughters , and sons who have whole life experiences , good and bad , just like all of us.\n\u201d Three years after Shockley \u2019 s release from prison , the now 71-year-old says he is gainfully employed , owns a home , purchased a car , and received the \u201c Achiever of the Year \u201d award on May 20 from Goodwill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support from relatives and Compassion Prison Project ,

was about 30 .\nShe only basked in that freedom for five years .\nIn 1853 , a white sheriff empowered by the Fugitive Slave Act abducted Wood and sold her back into bondage , taking her on a journey from Kentucky to Mississippi and finally to Texas , where she \u2019 d toil on a plantation through the Civil War .\nThough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1863 , Wood did not regain her freedom until 1866 , months after Union soldiers traveled to Texas on June 19 , 1865 \u2014 Juneteenth \u2014 to enforce emancipation .\nWood \u2014 whose pathbreaking story was only recently surfaced \u2014 returned to Ohio and sued her abductor for $ 20,000 ( worth more than $ 440,000 today ) .\nIn the lawsuit , she claimed that because she had been abducted , sold back into slavery , and lost wages ( about $ 500 per year ) , she was entitled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ litigation , 12 white jurors in a federal courtroom in Cincinnati found Wood \u2019 s claim valid and assessed her damages at $ 2,500 .\nThe final decision was just a pittance compared with what Wood demanded , but 144 years later , it remains the largest known payment ordered by an American institution in restitution for slavery .\nWood \u2019 s story was widely covered at the time for its singularity , but fell out of the news as white Americans tried to distance themselves from slavery and its aftermath .\nYet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised then are the same ones hanging sullenly over America today .\n\u201c Who will recompense the millions of men and women for the years of liberty of which they have been defrauded ?\n\u201d an 1878 New York Times article about the court \u2019 s decision asked .\n\u201c Who will make good to the thousands of kidnapped freemen the agony , distress , and bondage of a lifetime ?\n\u201d What the writer recognized was the growing call for reparations that began at the close of the Civil War and continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the federal government promised to provide \u201c 40 acres and a mule \u201d \u2014 an idea proposed by Black leaders at the time \u2014 to nearly 4 million recently freed men and women .\nThe effort would have redistributed land previously owned by the Confederates , giving the formerly enslaved a chance to own their own land and become economically self-sufficient \u2014 until the government , after Lincoln \u2019 s assassination , reneged .\nThat early proposal helped establish the concept of reparations as compensation to be paid to Black Americans for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the struggle for reparations only grew .\nActivists such as Callie House led a movement after Reconstruction and into the early 20th century to demand pensions for poor and aging formerly enslaved people , suing the federal government and arguing that it owed ex-slaves $ 68 million .\nHR 40 , a federal bill named after the federal promise more than 150 years ago for 40 acres of land , was introduced in Congress to task a commission to study and develop reparations proposals , but it has floundered in the House for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering why America is still keeping freedom out of reach .\nAt the beginning of May , a coalition of organizers , including the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America ( N \u2019 COBRA ) , Color of Change , and the Black Voters Matter Fund , sent a letter to President Joe Biden to demand that he create a federal commission by Juneteenth to study and develop reparations proposals for Black Americans .\n( The administration had not responded to the coalition by the time this article was published .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for racial justice , and the recent recognition of Juneteenth as a day of national importance calling for solemnity as well as celebration , have all brought a new wave of urgency to the centuries-long reparations debate .\n\u201c We need something much more substantive than the Juneteenth federal holiday .\nWe need reparatory justice , and we need it now , \u201d said Nkechi Taifa , the director of the Reparation Education Project , a nonprofit organization that teaches about reparations , and one of the signatories of the letter .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOur communities are demanding it.\n\u201d Over time , a more comprehensive reparations framework has emerged .\nIn addition to cash payments , true reparations would be a program of \u201c acknowledgement , redress and closure for a grievous injustice \u201d including \u201c slavery , legal segregation ( Jim Crow ) , and ongoing discrimination and stigmatization , \u201d economist William A. Darity and folklorist A. Kirsten Mullen argued in their 2020 book From Here to Equality : Reparations for Black Americans in the Twenty-First Century .\nDecades of demands on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it inflicted on enslaved people \u2014 and the resultant racism , discrimination , and segregation that cripple the Black community today \u2014 haven \u2019 t moved federal leaders to act , not toward acknowledgement nor apology , nor toward the kind of redress that economists say would be necessary to level the field for Black Americans .\nDarity and Mullen estimate that restitution in the form of direct cash payments would cost the American government $ 10 trillion to $ 12 trillion , or about $ 800,000 for each eligible Black household .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ in wealth , health , income , education , incarceration rates , and overall quality of life , experts have argued .\n\u201c We don \u2019 t have reparations right now because America isn \u2019 t sorry .\nWe have not had an adequate apology for slavery , \u201d said Edgar Villanueva , founder of the philanthropic organization Decolonizing Wealth Project , which funds reparative giving efforts .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a deep-seated fear of even the word reparations and a related scarcity mindset around America \u2019 s unwillingness to grapple with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSo instead , we \u2019 re experiencing the rewriting of history , the banning of books , and a fear of truth-telling.\n\u201d If the federal government \u2019 s commitment to reparations is doubtful , at the local level , a movement is gathering .\nAsheville , North Carolina \u2019 s City Council established a Community Reparations Commission in 2020 .\nThat year , Providence , Rhode Island \u2019 s mayor signed an executive order to pursue a \u201c truth-telling and reparations process \u201d in the city ; Burlington , Vermont , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilmington , North Carolina , considered doing the same .\nThe following year also saw momentum : California launched its reparations task force in 2021 , while separately , a group of mayors , Mayors Organized for Reparations and Equity , pledged to pay reparations to small groups of Black residents in their cities to show the federal government what is possible .\nGreenbelt , Maryland , voters approved a commission to study reparations , as did Detroit voters and the New York State Assembly .\nOther forms of repayment that some have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , in Evanston , Illinois , 16 Black families were selected at random from a pool of applicants to receive up to $ 25,000 in tax-free grants that can be used to pay for a home , pay off a mortgage or make home improvements .\nAlmost 100 years after California seized a Black family \u2019 s Bruce \u2019 s Beach property via eminent domain , the state agreed to return it to the descendants of the family who owned it .\nFinally , a judge last month ruled that the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white mob massacre could move forward with their lawsuit seeking reparations , despite motions by the defendants , including the city of Tulsa , to dismiss the case .\nIf local leaders can find the space to grapple with reparations , why can \u2019 t the federal government ?\nAt a federal level , President Biden \u2019 s evolving stance on reparations illustrates the country \u2019 s glacial pace of change and glaring unwillingness to engage in the reconciliation that would bring healing and closure to the people it has harmed .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea : \u201c I do not buy the concept , popular in the \u2019 60s , which said , \u2018 We have suppressed the black man for 300 years and the white man is now far ahead in the race for everything our society offers .\nIn order to even the score , we must now give the Black man a head start , or even hold the white man back , to even the race.\n\u201d As Biden campaigned for the presidency in 2020 , however , the nation saw what may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a white police officer murdered George Floyd in daylight , and he embraced the idea of studying reparations .\nBut in the past two years , as he navigated his priorities and failed to garner enough congressional support to pass some of his biggest agenda items , his administration has put the idea out of view .\nBeyond the few local lawmakers and federal officials who already back HR 40 , support for reparations in general remains low .\nIn 2014 , 68 percent of Americans polled by YouGov opposed financial payments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jim Crow , and redlining , while only 15 percent supported them .\nRecent polling found similar results .\nIn 2020 , 63 percent of Americans polled by ABC News and the Washington Post opposed cash payments , while 61 percent were opposed in 2021 .\nYet in 2020 , at the height of the Black Lives Matter protests , more people than ever ( 76 percent of Americans surveyed ) agreed that racial discrimination is a big problem in the United States .\nSmaller-scale local programs help keep the reparations dialogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer to a wider-scale reparations program \u2014 but they fall short of the country \u2019 s national imperative .\n\u201c No amount of material resources can ever compensate for what Black folks went through .\nWhatever ends up happening is going to be a negotiated settlement , \u201d Taifa said .\n\u201c Whether [ reparations make ] a material difference or not , the fact is there \u2019 s a debt that is owed and a debt that is due .\nIf I choose to just keep the money under my pillow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s my right.\n\u201d Major questions motivate the activists and thinkers pushing for reparations .\nWhere would the descendants of enslaved Americans be if it weren \u2019 t for the more than 200 years of forced labor ?\nDoes the United States want to live up to the ideals and exceptionalism it has touted for centuries ?\nMore than any logistical quandary about reparations , these questions lie at the heart of the fight .\nThey get to the center of what America represents and whether it has the power to truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already now up to around $ 26-27 trillion given the money we \u2019 re spending on Covid , \u201d Michael Tanner , a senior fellow at the conservative Cato Institute , told CNBC in 2020 about paying reparations .\n\u201c And we \u2019 re losing more money because we \u2019 re not picking up the revenue because economic growth is so slow right now .\nThis hardly seems the time to burden the economy with more debt , more taxes .\nEssentially what you want to do is stimulate economic growth for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree that stimulus plans that stand to boost all Americans won \u2019 t close the Black-white wealth gap .\nThey note that the formation of the republic after slavery intentionally excluded the formerly enslaved and their descendants in the decades after .\nDuring the Reconstruction era , Blacks were routinely disenfranchised , while the New Deal and GI Bill later also failed to fully include Black people .\nEven the passage of civil rights legislation didn \u2019 t open the door for America to fully grapple with racism .\nQuestions about who should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to be paid remain .\nSome believe that only descendants of people enslaved in the United States who can prove their lineage \u2014 that at least one ancestor was enslaved \u2014 can be eligible .\n( California \u2019 s task force , for example , decided that only residents with direct lineage to people formerly enslaved in America should be eligible for reparations . )\nThe plan mapped out by Darity and Mullen adds that eligible recipients must pass an identity standard \u2014 they must be able to prove that they self-identified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years prior to the enactment of a reparations plan .\nOthers believe that eligibility must be more inclusive , arguing that Black people who are third , fourth , and fifth generation in the United States could be part of the global network of enslavement that saw their ancestors enslaved in the Caribbean or South America .\nThey , too , have suffered under American racism and discrimination .\n\u201c The system of enslavement was intertwined to the point that we do not know and could never know for certain if one \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enslavers and the US government based on a geographical North American residence of enslavement , \u201d N \u2019 COBRA activists wrote in a memo .\nThere \u2019 s also discussion about the window for the reparations claim .\nShould 1619 , the year enslaved people landed in Jamestown , Virginia , be the beginning date for the claim , or the year 1776 , when America was founded ?\nWhat would constitute reparations ?\nSome have argued that reparations don \u2019 t have to be direct cash payments but can take the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the case of Evanston , Illinois , or educational grants , as in the case of Georgetown University .\nThe university has said it would help the descendants of enslaved people pay off school debts , an effort to contend with the fact that its founding relied on stolen Black labor .\nSome warn , however , that these limited programs can muddy efforts to secure federal cash payments .\n\u201c Reparations seems to be all over right now , but as we have these discussions , we have to be cautious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or let [ reparations ] be co-opted , \u201d Villanueva said .\nMany also believe that there is a grave need for a \u201c truth-telling \u201d effort that makes way for an apology : Without acknowledgment and a formal apology from the federal government , there can be no closure .\nThough Henrietta Wood got money that helped her raise her son at the turn of the century , she never received an apology from the man who re-enslaved her .\nNor did she get an apology for being born into a system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wood \u2019 s abductor tried to deny his crime and even boasted about growing famous for having bought one of the \u201c last slaves \u201d before the end of slavery .\n\u201c He can not escape the law , which will follow him and his property into the remotest nook of the Republic , \u201d the New York Times wrote of Wood \u2019 s captor .\nWhy should

, Derrick Bell held one of the most harrowing jobs in the legal profession .\nFrom 1960 to 1966 , as an attorney with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund , Bell oversaw desegregation lawsuits in the South , trying to make real the integration promised by Brown v.

couldn \u2019 t even find a plaintiff willing to sue a segregated district , because Black families justifiably feared they \u2019 d be targeted by the Ku Klux Klan if their names appeared on a lawsuit .\nBlack civil rights lawyers also risked their lives litigating cases .\nOnce , while he was defending two criminal suspects in Tennessee , future Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall was arrested on false charges and nearly lynched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who died in 2011 , eventually left behind his career as a full-time civil rights lawyer .\nBut the experience of watching the promise of

is never overcome.\n\u201d Bell understood something profound about the United States : The American political system is a rigged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage enslavers and today benefits anti-egalitarian actors with little interest in true racial equality .\nThat fact has led to the constant \u201c erosion of black rights \u201d that Bell chronicled \u2014 something clearly on display one year ago , not long after President Joe Biden had signed legislation marking Juneteenth as a federal holiday .\nIn the president \u2019 s words , the holiday \u201c marks both the long , hard night of slavery and subjugation , and a promise of a brighter morning to come.\n\u201d Two weeks later , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new limits on the Voting Rights Act , which has , since 1965 , forbidden race discrimination in elections .\nThe Court \u2019 s new restrictions on the Voting Rights Act are unlikely to be the last .\nEven as the United States celebrates freedom for African Americans , the political equality that sustains that freedom is slipping away .\nThe pattern in American civil rights history has been brief periods of rapid pro-egalitarian progress \u2014 think the post-Civil War period or the civil rights era \u2014 followed by much longer periods of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of those gains .\nIf the United States is to break its cycle of brief periods of egalitarian triumphs , and longer periods of resentment and retreat , we must have a Constitution that , unlike our current one , fully honors the principle that all people are created equal .\nThe original Constitution \u2014 that is , the document drafted at the Constitutional Convention of 1787 \u2014 was a truly monstrous document .\nIt was , in the words of abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison , \u201c a covenant with death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framers , who included both enslavers and staunch opponents of slavery , produced a document that contains at least four provisions added for the very purpose of protecting slavery .\nSeveral other features of the Constitution , like the Electoral College , for example , may not have been inserted for the purpose of promoting slavery , but they certainly had that effect .\nThough modern-day scholars disagree about whether the Electoral College was , in the words of Harvard historian Jill Lepore , \u201c a compromise over slavery , \u201d it nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that enslaved the most people .\nThat \u2019 s because the Constitution gives each state a number of electoral votes matching the number of seats it controls in Congress , and the Constitution \u2019 s infamous three-fifths clause permitted slave-holding states to count 60 percent of their enslaved population when US House seats were apportioned .\nEven after the Northern population outstripped the South \u2019 s to such a degree that slave states could not dominate the House , another anti-democratic feature of our Constitution ensured that enslavers would wield outsize power .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for enslavers for generations .\nBecause the Constitution gives each state two senators regardless of its population , enslavers could still block anti-slavery legislation so long as they did not permit the total number of free states to exceed the number of slave states , something they did successfully for decades .\nTwo hundred and thirty-five years after the Constitutional Convention , the Constitution remains a profoundly inegalitarian document .\nThe Senate and the Electoral College remain stains on the soul of the nation .\nSimilarly , while three constitutional amendments ratified after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal citizenship rights to all Americans , and promise equal voting rights , these promises were only as valuable as the public officials entrusted with keeping them .\nAs anyone familiar with the history of the Jim Crow South knows , most of these officials didn \u2019 t even begin to keep these promises for nearly a century .\nThe times when those promises were kept at all can be attributed to \u201c interest convergence , \u201d a phenomenon Bell first wrote about more than four decades ago : \u201c The interest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only when that interest converges with the interests of whites in policy-making positions.\n\u201d Bell did not argue that white people \u201c concerned about the immorality of racial inequality \u201d are nonexistent , but he believed that this cohort of white people is insufficient to form a victorious political coalition when it links arms with Black people .\nTo some extent , Bell \u2019 s principle is implicit in the fact that racial minorities are , well , in the minority .\nAnd Black people have historically carried a particular burden because white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the social and political mainstream , in many cases through explicitly segregationist policies .\nThe Constitution \u2019 s pathologies exaggerate this problem .\nBecause of the Electoral College , Senate malapportionment , and quasi-constitutional barriers to legislation such as the filibuster , Black Americans \u2014 and the broader Democratic coalition that most Black voters belong to \u2014 need to win supermajorities in multiple elections to pass legislation protecting their rights , like a law restoring the Voting Rights Act .\nEven if they were to successfully do that , Republicans need only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their fellow partisans on the Supreme Court to strike down that legislation .\nThis is not a new dilemma \u2014 the structural barriers facing Democrats today pale in comparison to the ones facing enslaved Black people in 1860 , or the ones facing civil rights activists in 1960 .\nBut one of the frustrating things about this particular moment in American history is that our Constitution now prevents Black Americans from achieving crucial civil rights victories even when a coalition aligned with their interests controls the Congress and the White House \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority of the nation .\nThat is a potent reminder that , in those rare moments when an egalitarian coalition does wield power , it should emphasize structural reforms that will allow it to achieve future victories and sustain past ones .\nBecause the best way to win a rigged game is to change the rules .\nIn 2022 , the interests of Black people have converged with the nation \u2019 s majority political party , at least on the crucial topic of voting rights .\nThe president of the United States supports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights protections that the Supreme Court stripped away in Shelby County and similar cases .\nSo does the vice president .\nSo do 219 members of the House of Representatives .\nSo does every Democrat in the Senate \u2014 although Sen. Joe Manchin ( D-WV ) backs a weaker version of this legislation than the Democratic leadership initially proposed .\nYet , because of structural barriers such as Senate malapportionment and the filibuster , this convergence of interests is not enough to pass a bill through Congress .\nIn the current Senate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seats , but the Democratic \u201c half \u201d represents 43 million more people than the Republican \u201c half.\n\u201d Black people , and racial minorities generally , bear the brunt of this uneven representation .\nAccording to a 2019 memo by the progressive think tank Data for Progress , Black voters have nearly 20 percent less influence over Senate elections than they would if Senate seats were distributed fairly so that every American \u2019 s vote counted the same .\nIn effect , while the Constitution once treated Black Americans as three-fifths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate treats Black Americans as four-fifths of a person .\nAbsent structural reform , it \u2019 s going to get worse .\nBy 2040 , according to a University of Virginia analysis of census projections , half of the United States will live in eight states .\nAbout 70 percent will live in 16 states \u2014 which means that just over 30 percent of the population will control 68 percent of the Senate .\nThis sorting of most Americans into just a few states has profound implications for Black voters , who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presidential elections , the Democratic candidate received 90 percent or more of the Black vote \u2014 and it may soon be impossible for Democrats to win a majority in the United States Senate .\nOne of the best predictors of partisan voting patterns in the United States is population density \u2014 densely populated areas tend to be Democratic bastions , while sparsely populated areas are typically Republican strongholds .\nIf this pattern holds , Republicans may soon gain a permanent supermajority in the Senate .\nWithout a Senate majority , Democrats not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal legislation , they also won \u2019 t be able to confirm justices to replace the ones who voted to gut the Voting Rights Act .\nIn effect , Black Americans \u2014 as well as non-Black Democrats , urban residents , and liberals generally \u2014 will only be able to achieve policy victories when their interests converge with an overwhelmingly white Republican Party .\nPerhaps that will happen occasionally , especially on symbolic matters ; the vote to make Juneteenth a federal holiday was bipartisan .\nIt \u2019 s also possible that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one-party rule , an increasing number of conservative Black Americans will join the GOP in the hopes of gaining some modicum of political power .\nBut on issues like voting rights , it \u2019 s hard to imagine Black interests converging with Republican interests anytime soon .\nWhy would the GOP protect the voting rights of a cohort that overwhelmingly prefers Democrats ?\nIt \u2019 s not that there isn \u2019 t hope for Black Americans .\nIt \u2019 s easy to design a more just and egalitarian system than the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to make an ideal constitution into a reality .\nThe obvious first step is to abolish the Senate or to , as University of Connecticut historian Manisha Sinha suggested to me , \u201c make our Senate a bit like the House of Lords \u201d \u2014 a largely advisory body that does not have the power to block legislation outright .\nAssuming that the United States retains a system where the chief executive is elected separately from the legislature , the Electoral College also must go .\nIn 2020 , President Joe Biden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 million votes .\nYet he would have lost the presidency if only 43,000 Biden voters in Georgia , Arizona , and Wisconsin had not cast a ballot .\nThat \u2019 s not acceptable in a nation that purports to be a democratic republic .\nThen there \u2019 s the problem of gerrymandering .\nRacial gerrymandering remains a prominent feature of American elections , and the Supreme Court appears determined to keep it that way .\nLast February , for example , the Court voted 5-4 to reinstate an Alabama congressional map that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state \u2019 s U.S. House seats \u2014 even though African Americans make up about 27 percent of the state \u2019 s population .\nThe best solution to the problem of gerrymandering is proportional representation .\nIn a proportional system , the nation would be divided into large electoral districts that would each receive several seats in Congress .\nThese seats would then be allocated according to the total percentage of votes each party receives \u2014 so if the Democratic Party receives 35 percent of the votes in a particular district , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s seats .\nUnder our current system , a district composed of 55 percent white Republicans and 45 percent Black Democrats will send zero Democrats to Congress .\nUnder a proportional system , the Black minority in such a district would receive nearly as much representation as the white majority .\nRealistically , a constitutional amendment is not a viable solution to implement any of these reforms .\nAmendments require three-quarters of the state legislatures to agree .\nAnd it \u2019 s unlikely that states that benefit from the Constitution \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThere may be feasible ways to enact some of these reforms without an amendment .\nThe National Popular Vote Compact , for example , calls for a bloc of states adding up to a majority of the Electoral College \u2019 s electoral votes to agree to give those votes to whichever candidate wins the popular vote .\nIt \u2019 s an ingenious way to nominally leave the Electoral College in place , while simultaneously ensuring that the candidate who wins the popular vote becomes president .\nOther ways around the effectively unamendable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine happening .\nA 2020 proposal in the Harvard Law Review , for example , suggested dividing the ( heavily Democratic ) District of Columbia into more than 100 states and admitting them all into the Union \u2014 and then immediately having these new states approve a raft of pro-democracy amendments to the Constitution .\nThe thing these solutions have in common is that they \u2019 re the sort of fixes that pit the Constitution \u2019 s formalistic rules against its spirit , and they \u2019 d likely trigger a significant backlash \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court that is still controlled by Republicans \u2014 unless they had a truly overwhelming political coalition behind them .\nIf the reforms suggested above are ambitious and difficult to implement , they are also equal in magnitude to the crisis facing American democracy .\nIf nothing changes , an overwhelmingly white , increasingly authoritarian political coalition could soon gain the enduring power to veto any federal law , along with perpetual control of the Supreme Court .\nThat is not a democracy , and it is unworthy of a nation that claims to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are created equal .\nTransforming the United States into an egalitarian democracy will not be easy .\nBut , as Niko Bowie , a professor at Harvard Law School , reminded me when I asked him how to overcome the many structural disadvantages plaguing American egalitarian movements , \u201c the United States has faced such a crisis before \u2026 nevertheless , democracy has emerged.\n\u201d It has emerged thanks to the work of those who retained a clear moral vision in the face of anti-egalitarianism .\nSo let me close by attempting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clarity William Lloyd Garrison offered to the abolitionist movement .\nIt is wrong that our Constitution denies the fundamental equality of all Americans .\nIt is wrong to count some votes more than others .\nIt is wrong to drive families into poverty solely because we count some votes more than others .\nIt is wrong to allow the one unelected branch of government to dismantle our voting rights .\nIt is wrong that our Congress will not restore those rights because a few senators care more about preserving the filibuster than they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an equal voice in our society .\nAnd it is wrong that an authoritarian narcissist , who possesses no aptitude for or interest in governance , was allowed to occupy the White House after receiving nearly 3 million fewer votes than his opponent .\nJuneteenth is an apt time to reflect on these matters .\nIt \u2019 s a reminder of our nation \u2019 s most unforgivable sin .\nBut it is also a celebration of freedom , and of those who overcame unimaginable odds to write equality into our Constitution .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise real , by changing the Constitution , if need be .\nAs Garrison said in 1844 , \u201c it is an insult to the common sense of mankind , to pretend that the Constitution was intended to embrace the entire population of the country under its sheltering wings ; or that the parties to it were actuated by a sense of justice and the spirit of impartial liberty ; or that it needs no alteration.\n\u201d Ian Millhiser is a senior correspondent at Vox , where he focuses on the Supreme Court @ @

"The Juneteenth Flag, Explained", "content": "This story is part of a special Juneteenth project with Vox which explores the ongoing struggle for freedom for Black Americans .\nAs the Juneteenth holiday approaches , you \u2019 ll start to see various symbols of Blackness across the country .\nFront lawns , apartment balconies , and clothing with the pan-African flag , \u201c Black Power \u201d fist , and other celebratory symbols will be everywhere .\nBut did you know there \u2019 s a specific flag for Juneteenth ?\nIn fact , it has a backstory that goes back to the late 1990s .\nCapital B spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s creator , and others to learn more about its history and impact .\nHaith , a community organizer and activist known better as \u201c Boston Ben , \u201d created the flag in 1997 .\nIn an interview with Capital B Atlanta , Haith said once he learned about Juneteenth , he felt passionately it needed representation .\n\u201c I was just doing what God told me , \u201d Haith said .\n\u201c I have somewhat of a marketing background , and I thought Juneteenth , what it represented , needed to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressed with the initial concept , but every Juneteenth holiday he would raise the flag near his son \u2019 s middle school in Roxbury , a majority Black community in Boston .\nAfter getting his inspiration for the flag , he knew which colors and symbols he wanted in the flag \u2014 he just needed to finalize it .\nThat \u2019 s when he met illustrator Lisa Jeanne-Graf , who responded to an ad in a local newspaper and finalized the flag in 2000 .\nJuneteenth is often associated with red , green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pan-African flag .\nHowever , those aren \u2019 t the colors of the Juneteenth flag .\nThe banner shares the colors of the American flag : red , white , and blue .\nIn the past , Haith has said it was a purposeful choice \u2014 a reminder that Black Americans descended from slaves are exactly that : American .\n\u201c For so long , our ancestors weren \u2019 t considered citizens of this country , \u201d Haith said .\n\u201c But realistically , and technically , they were citizens .\nThey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens .\nSo I thought it was important that the colors portray red , white , and blue , which we see in the American flag.\n\u201d Steven Williams , the president of the National Juneteenth Observance Foundation , agreed with the sentiment .\n\u201c We \u2019 re Americans of African descent , \u201d Williams said .\n\u201c [ The National Juneteenth Observance Foundation \u2019 s ] mission statement is to bring all Americans together to join our common bond of freedom.\n\u201d There \u2019 s been some debate about whether the Juneteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the holiday .\nHaith said he understood why people could have some hesitancy around commemorating the freedom of slaves by using a red , white , and blue flag , which some see as a tribute to the oppressors of Black Americans .\n\u201c Some of us were raised to recognize the American flag , we salute the American flag , we pledged allegiance to the American flag , \u201d Haith said when asked of the skepticism around the flag he created .\n\u201c We had relatives who went to war to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot into this country , even when our ancestors were enslaved .\nThey worked to help make this country an economic power in the world.\n\u201d The star in the middle of the flag has a dual meaning .\nOn June 19 , 1865 , Black slaves in Galveston , Texas , were informed of the Emancipation Proclamation , President Abraham Lincoln \u2019 s declaration of the freedom of enslaved people .\nThe star on the Juneteenth flag is meant to represent Texas as the Lone Star state , but also the freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the use of stars in helping slaves escape to freedom .\n\u201c When people were escaping down the Underground Railroad \u2026 they used stars to navigate where they were at , when they were going up and down , \u201d he said .\nWith its dual meaning , it \u2019 s meant to represent the role that Texas plays in the history of Juneteenth , but also as another reminder that Black people are free .\nThe outline around the star and the arch The outline was inspired by a nova , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creates the appearance of a new star .\nIn this instance , it represents both slaves being free and a new beginning for Black Americans , Haith said .\nThe bottom half of the flag is red and shaped in an arch , which has similar meaning to the white outline around the star .\nThe curve is meant to represent a \u201c new horizon.\n\u201d Williams hopes the design reminds people to keep in mind that new beginnings take effort .\n\u201c I tell young people , \u2018 You are free , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have obstacles , you might have hurdles , but you are free .\n\u2026 And you need to exercise that freedom , which is liberty.\n\u201d Juneteenth is now a federal holiday , nearly 200 years after slaves in Texas were informed of their freedom .\nThe change , signed into law by President Joe Biden in 2021 , came at the behest of demands for racial progress following the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis .\nCities across the country were forced to reckon with calls to remove and rename @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past .\nIn Richmond , Virginia , a capital of the former Confederacy , monuments of Confederate generals that were centuries old were dismantled after protester demands across the country .\nIn metro Atlanta , there is an ongoing debate around the removal of Confederate leaders etched on the side of Stone Mountain .\nIt is said to be the largest monument to the Confederacy in the world .\nIn America , the Southern Poverty Law Center estimates that at least 160 Confederate symbols were dismantled in 2020 .\nIndividual states started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior to Biden \u2019 s declaration .\nThe first was Texas in 1980 , and more states followed suit in 2020 .\nTheo Foster , a professor of African American History at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette , noted that symbols celebrating Black pride are important , but they \u2019 re not enough .\n\u201c We tend to just hold on to symbols and let the material go , \u201d he said .\n\u201c That \u2019 s where I \u2019 m hypercritical of progress narratives , and flags , and 1619 projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that point of where the rubber meets the road where the symbols meet the experience of Black boy joy or Black girl magic.\n\u201d Williams recognizes the flag as a larger part of his organization \u2019 s decades-long campaign to make Juneteenth a national holiday .\nThe National Juneteenth Observance Foundation has been on the front lines of the fight to have Juneteenth nationally recognized since its founding in 1997 .\nHaith himself is a member .\nFoster says he sees the Juneteenth flag as an attempt to honor Black Americans \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-Blackness exists .\nHow do we respond to that problem ?\n\u201d he said .\n\u201c I think the Juneteenth flag is an attempt to respond to that harm that is ongoing .\nI think people are right to be critical of it , but also to be in conversation of what \u2019 s useful about it.\n\u201d Haith said he \u2019 s been overwhelmed by the fact that Juneteenth is now a federal holiday , and feels honored when people use the flag .\n\u201c I believe we represent our ancestors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrate , we \u2019 re celebrating for them , and we \u2019 re celebrating for the future of our people .\nThe flag represents the people of the past , it represents us , and it will represent the people in the future .\n\u201d", "author": "Kenya Hunter, Capital B Atlanta", "url": "https://capitalbnews.org/juneteenth-flag-explainer/", "published": "Wed,

Should Everyone Be Celebrating?", "content": "Juneteenth has been celebrated for more than two decades in the small town of Fayette , Missouri .\nStarted by a historic Black church , the annual festivities have grown into a four-day event that includes a fashion show , a feast of pork steak and ribs , and other cultural displays .\nBut while the holiday celebrates the triumph of Black Americans over slavery , event coordinator Timothy Jackman approaches it with an inclusive mindset .\nIn addition to youth ball games and Juneteenth Jeopardy , organizers try to fold in ethnic foods from other cultures , Jackman said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wants to attract neighbors of all races to the celebration .\n\u201c Oddly enough , I heard from a non person of color this year that they didn \u2019 t know Juneteneth was for white people and that it was just for the Black community , \u201d he recalled .\n\u201c It just goes to show you that we still have some work to do.\n\u201d The decades-long effort to make Juneteenth a national holiday reached its goal last year , more than 150 years after freed Black Texans began the tradition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Juneteenth National Independence Day Act in June 2021 , only six states had made it an official paid state holiday \u2014 Texas , Massachusetts , New Jersey , New York , Pennsylvania and Virginia .\nLong before that , Black people such as Texas native Opal Lee , known as the \u201c Grandmother of Juneteenth , \u201d fought to make June 19 a national holiday .\nHistorically , Black churches and segregated parks served as meeting places for Juneteenth festivities , which included soul food , dances , clothing , and praise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized by Black Americans , Juneteenth events were largely held in Black spaces and reflective of Black cultures .\nBut with the adoption of the federal holiday , interest in celebrating Juneteenth has expanded and diversified .\nMany longtime observers of the holiday have encouraged that development .\nFor them Juneteenth is a recognition of American history that should be open to all people .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve always tried to make it an inclusive event and try to bring awareness to those people who are not people of color , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it wasn \u2019 t just all Black people , but there were white folks that were an important part of our history.\n\u201d Others fear that the new popularity of the holiday has led to commercialization and will undermine the cultural significance of June 19 .\nIn recent weeks , many have called out white-led businesses and groups for profiting off of Black culture and history with Juneteenth-themed products and events .\nThey argue that the federal holiday has overshadowed calls for more substantial policies to address systemic racism .\n\u201c I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I feel in many ways that the celebration of Juneteenth has become a way [ for white people ] to silence [ Black ] critics , \u201d said Dwonna Goldstone , associate professor and the director of African American Studies at Texas State University .\n\u201c It seems like it \u2019 s a way to placate black people into accepting \u2014 \u2018 See , we \u2019 re celebrating Juneteenth and we \u2019 re acknowledging what happened \u2019 \u2014 but without any real changes.\n\u201d More than two years after the signing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freed enslaved people in the Confederate states , Union soldiers told Black Americans in Galveston , Texas , that slavery ended .\nThe delayed announcement sparked Juneteenth , celebrations of freedom that spread through Southern Black communities in the years that followed , defined by the sounds , flavors and aesthetics of Black cultures .\nThose early influences are still seen in Juneteenth events across the country , particularly in rural communities where the holiday has been recognized for years , if not decades .\nIn Hugo , Oklahoma \u2014 a predominately white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crawley helped start the first Juneteenth event nearly 15 years ago .\nOrganizers raised about $ 2,000 to host a barbecue in the park , he recalled , with a spread of brisket , cole slaw , baked beans , red hot links , and juice for about 200 people .\nSimilar to the early traditions , Hugo \u2019 s celebration included oral history lessons from elders in the community and a parade , which now offers cash prizes for the best ATVs , motorcycles , animals , automobiles , and floats .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ where residents of all ages compete in a dance contest and play games such as musical chairs and tug of war .\nAt the opening ceremony , a local pastor explains the purpose of Juneteenth and the community joins in to sing \u201c Lift Every Voice and Sing , \u201d the Black National Anthem .\nCrawley , a retired army veteran and mechanic , has handed the reins for this year \u2019 s event to his daughter Katrina Bills , who has served on the town \u2019 s Juneteenth planning committee .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this committee for so long is my love for the community .\nI have a love for the betterment of our community and of our Black people , \u201d Bills said .\n\u201c They don \u2019 t realize what our ancestors went through for us to even be able to celebrate this day .\n\u2026 We want them to understand what it took.\n\u201d In some communities , the federal holiday has reignited interest in observing Juneteenth .\nIn Eatonton , Georgia , Monique Hines decided to revive the celebration in her hometown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing of spirituals and honoring of local World World II veterans and a Tuskegee Airman .\nThe most exciting activity , she added , is the African print-themed fashion and hair show .\nThey will crown a Little Miss and Little Mister Juneteenth and allow school-age children to model in the fashion show .\n\u201c We \u2019 re gon na try to take it back to the old school Bronner [ Bros. ] hair shows where you saw the hairstyles that you \u2019 re not gon na see on the street like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a loctician in nearby Macon .\n\u201c One of the styles that I \u2019 m going to do with the locs is actually turn his locs into a crown .\nIt \u2019 s going to be really fun.\n\u201d But even in this central Georgia town of fewer than 7,000 people , there are questions about how to recognize the holiday \u2014 and whether to celebrate at all .\nFashion designer Shayna McLaren said she didn \u2019 t know Juneteenth existed until a few years ago .\nThis year will be her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only because she was invited to Eatonton \u2019 s fashion show .\nOwner of Kraev Fashions in rural Loganville , Georgia , she is tasked with creating original tribal-inspired fashion pieces such as kente cloths for the event .\nOtherwise , she is unsure if she would be celebrating at all .\n\u201c This is going to sound shallow , but I just don \u2019 t know about it .\nIt just became the trending thing , \u201d McLaren said .\n\u201c Our culture hops on everything that \u2019 s trending and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still skeptical about what Juneteenth \u2019 s rise in popularity means for the authenticity of the holiday .\nIn the run-up to the holiday , there has been backlash to Walmart selling Juneteenth Ice Cream and the Indianapolis Children \u2019 s Museum offering Juneteenth Watermelon Salad .\nBoth organizations have since issued apologies and removed the items from their shelves .\nIn Arkansas , a \u201c leaked \u201d Juneteenth soul food and market festival flyer featured an all-white panel of judges and sparked outrage on social media .\nThat event was canceled .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the need for more discussions on policy changes and for white people to engage in anti-racism work related to economic inequality and housing security during Juneteenth .\n\u201c Malcolm X said in his autobiography that white people need to form their own organizations and do anti- racism work with other white people , \u201d Goldstone said .\n\u201c Until they are willing to put their lives on the line , as they did during the Freedom Rides when white people were getting beaten up like Black people were , I just

Lightsey Manuel \u2019 s efforts to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS through church congregations has gotten a little easier .\nWith growing public interest in racial disparities in health , faith leaders are more open to hearing the HIV facts she brings with her , some allowing her to give out condoms .\n\u201c Something shifted in January , \u201d said Lightsey Manuel , a community liaison for a health nonprofit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk about it , willing to know about it .\nI told my boss that I needed someone just to handle my social calendar because now I \u2019 m getting invited to events.\n\u201d Growing attention to health disparities could create a timely opportunity to raise awareness about sexually transmitted diseases , which saw a concerning increase during the pandemic , according to a recently released CDC report .\nAfter a decline in the first months of the coronavirus pandemic , STD cases rose by the end of 2020 .\nReported cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased by 10 % and 7 % , respectively , since 2019 , the data shows .\nAnd since 2016 , gonorrhea cases have increased by 45 % .\nBlack Americans have the highest rates of each of these STDs across racial groups .\nChlamydia was the only reported infection for which case rates declined , though experts say that is likely due to a decline in screening during the pandemic .\nThe decline was 1 % .\nWhile the report did not include the latest HIV numbers , Lightsey Manuel and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the COVID-19 pandemic .\n\u201c There were moments in 2020 when it felt like the world was standing still , but STDs weren \u2019 t , \u201d said Dr. Jonathan Mermin , director of the CDC \u2019 s National Center for HIV , Viral Hepatitis , STD , and TB Prevention .\n\u201c The unrelenting momentum of the STD epidemic continued even as STD prevention services were disrupted.\n\u201d There was a slight decline in reported cases early in 2020 , likely due to the diversion of public health resources to address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to unemployment , the reduction of in-person routine health visits , and a shortage of STD labs , according to the CDC .\nThose factors complicated STD testing and treatment , which are critical to reducing the spread .\nAnd with a lack of testing early on , the data lags .\nBlack women are the hardest hit by chlamydia cases , and Black men face a disproportionately high rate of gonorrhea and syphilis cases .\nThe chlamydia cases are largely driven by young adults ages 15 to 24 , the data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account for more cases than women .\nLike other health disparities , experts say the inequities in sexual health are driven by factors like access to quality health care and comprehensive sex education .\n\u201c A lot of the time people don \u2019 t have access , \u201d said Shemeka Thorpe , a University of Kentucky researcher who focuses on the sexual well-being of Black women .\n\u201c People don \u2019 t have access to testing .\nPeople don \u2019 t have access to condoms.\n\u201d Access to information is also important , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less likely to have access to comprehensive sex ed , \u201d she said , partially due to their concentration in Southern states , which tend to teach abstinence only .\nPeople are often unaware of how often to get tested for STDs , said Thorpe , or mistakenly believe infections are always visible .\nMyths about the prevalence of STDs are pervasive , she said , such as the belief that syphilis is an \u201c old STI.\n\u201d Yet the rates of syphilis , according to the CDC , are up more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % for cases passed from mother to infant .\nIncreased education , testing , use of barriers methods to STD prevention and open , honest communication between partners are crucial to reducing the spread , said Thorpe .\n\u201c It \u2019 s important to know your partner \u2019 s status , \u201d and understand which infections are treatable , she said .\n\u201c Just because you have an STI doesn \u2019 t mean the world is over.\n\u201d Herpes , for example , is treatable , though not curable .\n\u201c It also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Condoms and dental dams , regardless of sexuality and the sex of your partner , are important to reducing transmission , experts say .\nBut condom negotiation can be difficult , said Rasheeta Chandler , an assistant professor at Emory University \u2019 s School of Nursing .\nAmong the women she \u2019 s engaged with in her research , some have expressed a sense of distrust within their relationships when asking their partner to use a condom .\nIn Thorpe \u2019 s work , she \u2019 s found couples often trust their partner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condoms .\nThe STD rates are \u201c an outcome of people trying to have pleasure , \u201d she said .\nLarger , systemic barriers to testing and treatment are also persistent .\n\u201c Transportation can sometimes be a huge barrier , \u201d said Chandler .\nIn some ways , the COVID-19 pandemic helped expand access to testing in new ways , she said .\n\u201c More health care institutions should consider more innovative ways of meeting people where they are.\n\u201d Engaging communities \u2014 like the work Lightsey Manuel is doing in Florida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that \u2019 s not stigmatizing , particularly for Black communities , said Chandler .\n\u201c We understand sex is a part of life , \u201d said Chandler .\n\u201c We

locking people out of opportunities .\nSo , it \u2019 s a very multifaceted challenge \u201d Capital B national health reporter Margo Snipe was joined by the founder and CEO of K \u2019 ept Health ,

access to the foods and resources necessary to improve health .\nHere \u2019 s a snippet of their conversation .\nMargo Snipe : Something that I \u2019 ve been noticing , the sort of wave of digital technology , whether it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to engage specific communities , or get community specific information .\nHow do you think that will bridge the gap in some of these inequities ?\nEmily Brown : Twenty-four percent , or 1 in 4 Americans , live in what the USDA terms a food desert .\nWe know that healthy food is not always accessible , it may not be in your community .\nIt \u2019 s not just an affordability issue , it \u2019 s just not available to you .\nFor us it \u2019 s getting that food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model that empowers the users .\nTechnology allows us to then get those resources into communities where the physical infrastructure is not available .\nSheena Franklin : Telemedicine has the ability to close these health equity gaps , when it comes to actually receiving care , right ?\nWe have the mindset of , we \u2019 re building upon what the Emilys are out there doing , right ?\nThe access is about whether you \u2019 re in an urban area and you have challenges , in a rural area and you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that telemedicine app , what we \u2019 re trying to do is provide the information .\nHow are we formulating questions ?\nHow are we starting to

This Historian Wants to Change That.", "content": "Saying America has a troubled relationship with the land it seized from Indigenous people would be an understatement .\nColonialism , and the taking of land through force and murder , defined the country \u2019 s borders .\nThe struggle over terrain continues today with the threat of climate change , an increase in internal migration , and the soaring cost of housing .\nJocelyn Imani , a trained historian from Nashville , Tennessee , is tasked with preserving the parts of U.S. land that are of significance to Black American history and culture .\nIn May , she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director of the Trust for Public Land , one of the country \u2019 s largest nonprofit groups focused on creating and maintaining local and national parks and historical districts .\nImani has her work cut out for her .\nSince 1972 , TPL has led more than 5,000 conservation projects , spanning 3 million acres of land in the United States , but Black history has been largely absent from the work of land preservation .\nThe federal government has identified 2 million sites worthy of preservation since the founding of the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , just 2 % of the preserved locations focus on the experiences of Black Americans .\nDue to racial and economic biases , sites exemplifying white history have routinely met the standards for preservation , while Black sites have long been excluded from consideration .\nBlack land preservation sites include Brown Chapel AME Church , the starting point for the Selma to Montgomery marches in 1965 ; Little Rock Central High School , one of the first major battles over school desegregation ; and the Martin Luther King Historic District in Atlanta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designations have been destroyed and actively erased through arson and targeted violence .\nOthers have failed to meet the \u201c architectural significance \u201d criteria outlined by the National Historic Landmarks Program .\nBlack historical communities and buildings have long been excluded because they were too \u201c modest \u201d and lacked the architectural and physical stability to receive landmark status .\nHistoric landmark designations are not just about how and what we remember about our past ; they often work to alter a community \u2019 s future .\nThey signal to all levels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c worthy \u201d of investment .\nOften , landmark designations lead to thousands , if not millions , of dollars being pumped into communities for new streets , improved housing and even increased policing .\nBut these investments can lead to adverse effects in Black and brown communities .\nThere have been dozens of examples across the country of land preservation leading to higher costs of living and the pushing out of long-time residents .\nOn the heels of the 2020 racial justice protest , Imani hopes to save as many Black sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with Imani to understand more about the need to memorialize Blackness today .\nThe interview has been edited for length and clarity .\nCapital B : What drew you to your new role at the Trust for Public Land and the idea of enshrining history at this specific time ?\nJocelyn Imani : I come from a whole family .\nIt \u2019 s important to understand that I have a professional life , but before we get to my professional life , I come from regular working class , churchgoing Black folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family .\nSo at this point , we \u2019 ve spread to about 20-25 states now .\nThat means I \u2019 ve been meaning-making and storytelling within the Black community my whole life .\nComing out of church knowing you got to find out what your gift is \u2014 what \u2019 s your output to make the world better \u2014 starts at an early age .\nI found that all stories matter , history matters , and telling our stories in a way that reflects us back to ourselves in the highest light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world that twists the reflection back at us to the lowest common denominator .\nSo for me , the [ Trust for Public Land ] piece was an opportunity to merge worlds because I come from history , I worked in public lands , I worked in government , and I worked at a museum .\nAll these things , but they \u2019 re always so segmented and bifurcated versus all of them working together .\nI believe there is a difference in people \u2019 s minds when thinking about preserving Black sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe in the last 100 years , like Motown , but when we think of more historical , particularly natural areas , many of those places harbored dark secrets and Black death .\nHow are you reconciling with that and choosing which you want to focus on early on in this position ?\nI think it \u2019 s important to back up , just in terms of the landscape .\nOnly 2 % of the 95,000 sites on the national register are Black stories \u2014 2 % .\nThat \u2019 s it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before we can get to the conversation of the diversity of stories and what stories we are telling , our stories are not there ; they \u2019 re not institutionalized .\nBut then to the next level , once we get on a path , we can figure out what stories are told .\nFor me , the number one driving factor is the self-determination and agency of Black people in Black communities .\nHow do I highlight Black folks who work for themselves ?\nBecause that is the story .\nWe \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ve been doing urban agriculture , rural agriculture .\nWe \u2019 ve been building institutions , teaching , and doing all of these things across the landscape that are now the new hot things like sustainability .\nWe \u2019 ve been doing sustainability .\nBut those stories get lost in the shuffle because nobody \u2019 s telling our stories .\nSo even if we want to tell a dark story , a tragedy , for me , it \u2019 s , \u201c Where \u2019 s the self-determination ?\n\u201d For example , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Memorial Garden and we also worked with the Philando Castile Peace Memorial .\nThose are stories of horrible Black death , but for me , the triumph is in the agency of the communities that rallied around and advocated for themselves .\nIt sounds like community movements are behind your work \u2019 s focus .\nIs it a goal to follow communities that are advocating for themselves ?\nFor [ the Trust for Public Land ] , community is at the heart of everything we do as an organization .\nWe \u2019 re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we \u2019 ve been about land for people and communities for 50 years .\nFun tidbit : When I was interviewing for this job , somebody let it slip casually that we worked with the Black Panther Party , and I said , \u201c Hold up , record scratch.\n\u201d Sure enough , I \u2019 m blessed to have a lot of elders who are original Panthers , and I called one of them out of Oakland .\nAnd I said , \u201c Hey , have you ever heard of the Trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , \u201c Oh , yeah , I remember them , and I remember we did something in Oakland.\n\u201d So , we \u2019 ve been doing this community work .\nIt \u2019 s just a matter of now championing communities to own their own stories and harnessing them in a better way .\nWhen thinking about community , there are many movements around in places like Los Angeles , Houston , and Chicago working to block sites and landmarks from becoming added to the registry because of fears of residents being pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values of communities .\nIs gentrification due to Black land preservation something you are trying to combat ?\nHow do we support communities without being colonial in our impact ?\nThat thread is part of the conversation that we are having with activists .\nTo the point of this fear of preserving and codifying historical sites and that driving gentrification , I think that \u2019 s where two things have to happen .\nOne , there has to be political and communal education .\nThis goes both ways in terms of TPL listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TPL \u2019 s perspective , there must be an understanding of why it is an advantage to make something a historic site versus what real estate would look like if you don \u2019 t make it a historic site .\nThe second piece is that we have to have good faith conversations : honest , ongoing , and engaging conversations about not just about preserving the land but caring about how it impacts the people .\nAre there any sites you \u2019 re working on right now that combine those community-centered approaches ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ is visit Nicodemus , Kansas .\nI think that \u2019 s a story we all should know .\nIt \u2019 s one of the oldest Black towns that was free during the antebellum period .\nWhen folks were fleeing the South , they went to the middle of the state and made this place the oldest continually operating Black town .\nWe \u2019 ll be helping to support their homecoming celebration that has been going on for like 100 years .", "author": "Adam Mahoney", "url":

Search for a New Black Mecca in the South?", "content": "Rhiana Gunn-Wright knows Black life in America is fragile \u2014 by design .\nThe idea of \u201c home \u201d has constantly been threatened : Slavery and segregation legally dictated where Black Americans could live for centuries , and the residual effects of those racist institutions continue to guide where they plant their roots .\nWhen you think about it , Gunn-Wright says , every generation has had to migrate to thrive .\n\u201c Black people are always just trying to do their best , \u201d the 32-year-old Chicago native says .\n\u201c But when we \u2019 re operating under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to do our best , we \u2019 re always going to be forced to run away from something or someplace.\n\u201d Gunn-Wright has experienced that instability herself .\nIt drove her from Chicago in search of a place where she could feel emotionally , economically , and environmentally safe .\nOr as she put it : a place where she wouldn \u2019 t have to miss school because of bouts of asthma and bronchitis brought on by a debilitating mix of urban heat and pollution in her neighborhood .\nShe found some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and less intercommunal violence \u2014 when she attended Yale University and then the University of Oxford on a prestigious Rhodes Scholarship .\nBut survivor \u2019 s guilt followed .\nGunn-Wright felt deeply separated from her community , a feeling that drove her to focus on economic and climate policy as a way to serve her community \u201c in really tangible ways.\n\u201d \u201c I knew it didn \u2019 t have to be this way , \u201d said Gunn-Wright , who recently moved back to her hometown .\n\u201c I wanted to change the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move away from the community that they are from to try to have a better life.\n\u201d Hundreds of thousands of Black Americans are leaving the coasts and parts of the Midwest in search of better jobs , safer communities , and more stability in the South .\nSince 2010 , the three most populated cities in the country \u2014 New York , Los Angeles and Chicago \u2014 each have lost hundreds of thousands of Black residents while the Black populations in the Southern metro areas of Atlanta , Houston , Dallas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift reverses the journey of their great-grandparents , who moved north in search of industrial jobs during the Great Migration of the early- to mid-20th century .\nBut there are consequences to this latest round of Black migration .\nWhile the new environments often offer greater economic stability , they also bring hurricanes and triple-digit temperatures \u2014 extreme weather that can upend people \u2019 s life and create a cycle of housing and economic instability as families run from one refuge to the next .\nGunn-Wright is now the director of climate policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy think tank .\nShe previously interned for Michelle Obama , worked in the Detroit Department of Health , and most famously helped architect the Green New Deal with U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez .\nThe Green New Deal , arguably the country \u2019 s most progressive federal climate policy proposal , includes plans to cut the country \u2019 s greenhouse gas emissions , create jobs to clean up polluted communities , and even offer reparations to Black and brown communities most directly impacted by climate change .\nCapital B caught up with Gunn-Wright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ migration , its impacts on Black culture , and the possible environmental implications .\nThe interview has been edited for length and clarity .\nCapital B : How does your personal experience with migration and climate injustices affect how you approach this work ?\nRhiana Gunn-Wright : I grew up on the South Side of Chicago in Englewood .\nIt \u2019 s a place where people get left behind .\nThere were a lot of things that I saw that made me feel like no one cared about us except each other .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw Englewood , a Great Migration hub itself , as the perfect place for where these issues met .\nWhen I first started , environmental policy was described as just for polar bears and solar panels , essentially for elite white people .\nThen I started to see firsthand how environmental injustice shapes people \u2019 s lives .\nI began to understand why Black people were trapped in a community like mine without access to jobs , overrun with pollution and high asthma rates , and left to fend for ourselves .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity and economic policy .\nThe way that our built environment is designed has real impacts on how Black people , especially low-income Black people , can live .\nBecause when your baby has asthma , they \u2019 re in the hospital , and you \u2019 re working an hourly job , that changes the contours of your life .\nWhen the only place you can afford to live is next to an oil refinery that is not controlling its pollution , and suddenly you \u2019 re having \u2018 mysterious \u2019 cancers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can \u2019 t sell your house because no one else wants to live next to the superhighway , of course , you \u2019 re going to want to escape .\nWe \u2019 re constantly told that climate change will hit Black Americans the hardest , but it is framed as something that will happen in the future .\nWhat are the most significant climate challenges facing Black folks right now ?\nOn an individual level , because of racist economic policies , redlining , and just the history of systemic racism , Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places that will bear the worst brunt of the climate crisis .\nRedlining left us more likely to live next to industrial facilities , areas with higher levels of pollution , and places that are flood zones .\nAnd you know , poor health outcomes come with that .\nIt also means we have fewer means to respond to and recover from disasters and less upfront capital to adapt .\nWhile white people get to cash in on tax credits to weatherize their communities and build out clean energy , Black families are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adaptive advantages .\nSo we \u2019 re already spending more money than white people because of climate disasters while also having less chance to prepare for future disasters .\nYou \u2019 ve hit on essential points , especially the reality around Black people not having the financial means to have agency around disasters , whether in preparing for them , fleeing from them , or rebuilding after them .\nWhat does that mean for the tens of thousands of Black folks rushing to the South towards climate disasters ?\nThis is a really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move is so emotional .\nOne thing that breaks my heart the most about the climate crisis is that some places likely will not exist .\nThink about all the touchstones people have for the areas where they live , so when human-caused climate change takes away the place someone lived , it is not just a physical space .\nYou \u2019 re taking away our community , memory , and our voice .\nFor the entirety of America \u2019 s existence , Black folks have been asked \u2014 and forced \u2014 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverse migration is an example of it again .\nBlack people are squeezed between systems that don \u2019 t serve them .\nMany people are moving South because it \u2019 s cheaper and racism has made it hard to survive elsewhere , but now they \u2019 re just being put in the crosshairs of the climate crisis in ways that are more pronounced and more dangerous than it has ever been .\nAt Capital B , we \u2019 ve been thinking a lot about this because there is a consensus that there will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America .\nStill , for white folks , that means fleeing from climate disasters .\nFor Black folks , however , that will probably mean they \u2019 ll be left to live in the communities that white people have vacated .\nYou \u2019 re totally right .\nIt \u2019 s not as cut and dry as people think .\nOn the optimistic side , we have to hope that with white flight and a larger Black presence in these communities threatened by climate change , Black folks will communicate more political power and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapt before disasters .\nSurviving a disaster comes down to essentially mutual aid and support , and we know majority-Black communities will have a stronger network .\nAt the end of the day , people are moving for a higher quality of life , but the question of constant disasters down the line makes it really thorny because you \u2019 re asking how long will that better quality of life last ?\nTo have a better life , Black people are essentially moving towards the eye of the storm ; it \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the South in the last few years ?\nCapital B wants to hear from you !\nIf you \u2019 re interested in sharing your experience , please fill out this Google Form .",

, growing segregation , and a tight job market had already pushed out more than 200,000 Black residents since 2000 .\nThe pandemic was the last straw for Johnson .\nOnce the smoke cleared and the \u201c mobile morgues \u201d were rolled away , she was gone .\n\u201c I was living in a small one-bedroom apartment with myself , my partner , and our dog , \u201d Johnson said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c I had to leave for the present moment , but also my future .\nIf there is another pandemic-like disaster , I \u2019 d rather be here than be stuck in an apartment.\n\u201d The move offered her more stability in her professional life and the ability to reconnect with her roots , she said .\nThat mindset resonates with many Black Americans who \u2019 ve traded the big-city life of the Northeast , Midwest , and West Coast for booming Southern metropolises .\nBefore the pandemic , there was already a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South , dubbed the \u201c Reverse Great Migration \u201d by historians , but COVID-19 accelerated the shift .\nAcross the country , suburban and rural areas have seen a boom in Black residents who \u2019 ve left urban centers with a desire for communities with more economic investment , accessible education , affordable housing , and a higher concentration of Black residents .\nBut as seen during the Great Migration , leaving one city or neighborhood \u2014 often out of necessity \u2014 does not guarantee access to a better life .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves of Black migration .\nFor the first time in United States history , the white population is declining nationwide and white Americans are leaving the South in droves .\nWith the shuffling of demographics , white population loss throughout the South is being countered by Black growth and the general increase of people of color .\nThese major demographic changes are set to profoundly impact the country \u2019 s environment , economy , politics , and culture .\nHowever , as Black folks move back South in masses to be reconnected with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they \u2019 ve been awakened to troubling \u2014 and potentially life-threatening \u2014 realities : higher temperatures , stronger storms , and longer droughts .\nEach of the three Southern cities with the fastest-growing Black populations \u2013 Dallas , Houston , and Atlanta \u2013 is set to be one of the worst-hit places for future severe weather events .\nHouston , which has the second-fastest-growing Black population in the country , will average 55 extreme heat days a year by the end of the century , compared with just one in 1990 , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government .\nJohnson , who spent her childhood living in the South , is already grappling with the consequences .\n\u201c It \u2019 s hot as shit , \u201d she said plainly about the region reeling from a record-breaking heatwave .\n\u201c And it definitely feels hotter than what I remember.\n\u201d Harris County , where Houston is located , has the country \u2019 s highest hazard risk from disasters , according to the National Centers for Environmental Information .\nIn recent years , the city has suffered from Hurricane Harvey , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damaged 200,000 homes , and a deadly 2021 winter storm which thousands of Houston residents had still not recovered from as of this spring .\nMany of those residents are \u201c climate migrants \u201d themselves , having moved to Houston after Hurricane Katrina altered the lives of an entire generation of Mississippi and Louisiana residents .\nFor Johnson and many other Black folks in her position

I would be able to get a pretty good return in the future.\n\u201d Although , if history is any indicator , Black Americans are least likely to retain housing and wealth in the face of disaster .\nA 2018 study by Rice University found that white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage and received federal aid after a disaster actually saw their wealth rise , while Black residents lost wealth .\nMigrating in search

particularly Black and brown people \u2014 in a state of shock and dismay .\nThe panel of nine justices handed down life-altering rulings that transformed the landscape on reproductive rights , restricted government action on climate change and limited recourse for victims of wrongful convictions .\nWith six Republican-appointed justices on the court , the landmark 2021-2022 session has ended with elected officials calling for impeachment of two jurists , pending bills to end lifetime appointments and renewed calls to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bench .\nIt \u2019 s the culmination of decades of Republican efforts to shift the ideological balance of the court to the right .\nJustice Clarence Thomas , the second Black man appointed to the high court , joined in 1991 amid allegations of sexual harassment and controversial views on issues such as affirmative action .\nIn 2017 , after Republican senators blocked the nomination of Merick Garland in Barack Obama \u2019 s final year as president

Biden signing the bill into law .\nBut , what does that mean for people like Kind , potential victims of drive by shootings ?\nRon Hampton , a retired police officer with the Metropolitan Police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adviser for the National Black Police Association , said that because lawmakers did not deal with the influx of illegal guns on the streets in the past , \u201c we are now seeing our failures

drive-by shooting with an automatic weapon , all you got ta do is hold on the trigger and empty the clip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hampton said .\n\u201c The guns have gotten larger and the results are even more devastating.\n\u201d There was federal action against assault weapons in 1994 when President Bill Clinton enacted a ban , but that did not stop the production of those weapons .\nIn 2000 , there were nearly 1.6 million assault-style weapons manufactured , the ATF reported .\nClinton \u2019 s federal ban was lifted in 2004 , and only seven states \u2014 California , Connecticut , Hawaii , Maryland

many legal and illegal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point where every man , woman , and child can have up to four firearms per person .\n\u201c In cities like New York and in Washington , D.C. , what we have is a problem that guns and weapons were brought into the city from outside the city , because Maryland and Virginia have gun stores so you can buy a gun , \u201d Hampton said .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t believe you can stop the proliferation of illegal handguns .\nIf somebody wants to get an illegal gun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Drive-by shootings have been reported in every state in the country and Washington , D.C. , and in territories such as Puerto Rico , Guam , as well as St. Thomas and St. Croix islands , according to the GVA .\nThey are a pervasive and persistent form of American gun violence .\nSeveral cities \u2014 including Atlanta , Baltimore , Chicago , Dallas , Houston , and New Orleans \u2014 have endured dozens of drive-by shootings since 2013 , according to the GVA .\nWhile drive-bys commonly have been associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c road rage or personal disputes between neighbors , acquaintances , or strangers , \u201d according to a 2007 workbook for

November 2017 , firing 30 shots into an elementary school .\nNeal was killed by police after he murdered four and injured 10 .\nUnfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families of bystanders , solving these cases are often difficult for police .\nInvestigation into drive-by shootings requires cooperation from witnesses and the community , Hampton said .\nThey often include a thorough crime scene evaluation to collect any shell casings left behind , with the aim to trace them back to the weapon , and reviewing video from doorbell cameras , city-installed cameras , and cellphones .\nBut investigators \u201c often receive very limited information from witnesses , \u201d according to the DOJ guide , \u201c because most drive-by shootings occur at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very chaotic , and occur in neighborhoods

take much imagination \u201d on how to do a drive-by shooting because of the prevalence in entertainment , said Hampton , who was on the force for 24 years until 1994 .\nAccording to IMDB , there have

been working in their communities for decades to combat the problem .\nIn June , Brooklyn , New York , District Attorney Eric Gonzalez announced a multimillion-dollar investment into gang violence prevention programs and youth engagement as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evidence Lab , a new Ghost gun Unit and an executive position focusing on gun violence reduction.\n\u201d In Kind \u2019 s death ,

with kid gloves compared to Black people suspected of lesser crimes isn \u2019 t easy .\nCapital B contacted federal agencies tasked with tracking shootings by police , but none identified the race of suspects .\nIt \u2019 s not just their active shooter data \u2014 federal agencies don \u2019 t break down any police shootings down by race .\nThe FBI recently released a report on active shooter incidents that occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were killed by police in 14 of the 61 incidents .\nIn 30 cases , the gunmen were apprehended \u2014 most at another location after the shooting \u2014 and four of those incidents ended when armed and unarmed civilians engaged with the shooter to stop the threat .\nBut when Capital B asked the FBI for the race and ethnicity of the active shooters , a press officer said via email , \u201c We have no additional information to provide other than what was provided within the 2021 Active Shooter Report.\n\u201d The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which only started receiving funding to examine gun-violence as a public health crisis in 2018 , also does not track the race or ethnicity of active shooters .\nHowever , the national agency pointed Capital B to the summary of a federally funded project that analyzed the psychosocial history of public mass shooters from 1966 to 2019 .\nInvestigators found that there have been 172 mass shooters \u2014 based on the FBI \u2019 s mass shooting definition of four or more deaths \u2014 during that period and identified them as : 52.3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8.1 % Latino , 6.4 % Asian , 4.2 % Middle Eastern , and 1.8 % Native American .\nWhile the project revealed that 58.7 % of the shooters died on the scene \u2014 38.4 % dying by suicide and 20.3 % killed by law enforcement officers \u2014 it did not break down those categories by their race .\n\u201c We should research it because we need to know the problem exists so we can address it , \u201d said Keith Taylor , a retired assistant commissioner with the New York City Police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with policy , training , and education.\n\u201d While federal agencies have failed to track how police handle suspects by race , some independent organizations have maintained databases of all police-involved shootings based on news articles , social media posts , university studies , and police reports .\nThose organizations , including The Washington Post and Mapping Police Violence , have concluded that Black people are killed by the police at a higher rate and whites .\nSo far this year , 286 people have been killed by police , according to Mapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some races and ethnicities .\nThe victims include 67 whites , 49 Blacks , 32 Hispanics , 3 Asians , and 2 Native Americans .\nWhile those figures show that more whites were killed , when you factor in that Blacks are less than 13 % of the U.S. population , these numbers show the disparity .\nImproving police tactics and providing implicit bias training could make a difference when officers do encounter a person of color , Taylor said .\n\u201c There are lots of things that police can encounter that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation is more of a threat than it actually is , \u201d he said , noting the history of Black people being treated with harsher consequences than white suspects is in part because of implicit biases of police .\n\u201c We \u2019 re in 2022 and our training has to encompass this history and aspects of policing that no one is proud of .\nBut everyone who \u2019 s wearing that badge has to be aware of that so that they can make better decisions.\n\u201d More than a week after Walker \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera footage from his last moments alive .\nDelayed release of such footage could cause more damage , Taylor said , allowing the public to circulate false

Wade Means for the American Education System", "content": "The national childhood poverty rate reached record lows just before the pandemic .\nThe share of children living below the federal poverty line dropped from 22 % to 14 % over the previous decade , with Black and Hispanic children benefiting most from the decline .\nThe economic downturn in 2020 reversed that trend \u2014 and the overturning of abortion rights could exacerbate it , some experts say , by forcing more people to follow through with pregnancies that they are not financially prepared for .\nChildhood poverty is linked to a wide range of challenges , from poor health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental illness and involvement in the juvenile justice system .\nIt also impacts schooling , with impoverished children experiencing lower academic achievement and higher drop-out rates than other students .\nTest scores already dropped significantly as students shifted to remote schooling during the pandemic , a learning loss that particularly affected Black and Hispanic students .\nAn uptick in child poverty rates could further the racial inequalities that are already rampant in education , said Christopher Nellum , executive director of the Education Trust-West , a nonprofit advocacy for students of color .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor ] kids in schools now , given that decision , \u201d Nellum said .\n\u201c It means we either have a chance to support student \u2019 s growth and learning \u2014 or we have more opportunities to deny Black students access to what they need and deserve in schools .\nHistory tells us that we are probably going to do more of the latter , unfortunately.\n\u201d More than 1 in 4 Black children in the U.S. is living in poverty , one of the highest rates of any racial group .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the early 1980s , largely thanks to government policies like the expansion of food stamps .\nBut Black children are still overrepresented among the 10.5 million American youth in poverty .\nThere are just as many impoverished Black children as there are white children \u2014 even though there are three times as many white children in the U.S. As a result , Nellum points out , \u201c the vast majority of Black students enter schools that are concentrated with high proportions of other students who experience poverty .\n\u2026 So individual students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poverty , and then they enter schools , with more students who experience poverty.\n\u201d Living in a low-income community can affect every aspect of a student \u2019 s time in school .\nBecause public schools are funded in part by local property taxes , those in high poverty areas often have less to spend on teacher salaries and educational resources .\nLow pay and benefits could mean schools struggle to retain qualified educators , and cash-strapped districts can suffer from outdated and tattered textbooks and supplies , as well as subpar school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these students are encountering a lower-quality curriculum that hasn \u2019 t been designed to be aligned with standards in a particular state or with different ways of learning , \u201d Nellum said .\n\u201c There are innovative teaching practices that can reach students where they are \u2014 and that could not be present in a school that is serving low-income Black students , for example.\n\u201d While the racial achievement gap has been gradually decreasing over the past several decades , it \u2019 s still stark .\nIn one assessment by Stanford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test scores between Black and white students in 2019 accounts for almost two years of schooling .\nThe Stanford assessment emphasized that the reasons for that gap extended beyond school walls .\n\u201c A child \u2019 s early experiences \u2014 at home , in child care and preschool , in their neighborhoods , and with their peers \u2014 provide opportunities to develop socioemotional and academic capacities , \u201d the researchers noted .\n\u201c Gaps in average test scores , therefore , represent gaps in educational opportunity.\n\u201d The U.S. Supreme Court decision to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case that established federal abortion rights \u2014 immediately made the procedure illegal in at least 13 states with trigger bans .\nMany are in the South , where the majority of Black Americans live .\nMississippi , which has one of the largest Black populations in the country , shut down its last abortion clinic following the court \u2019 s decision .\nWhile some states continue to allow abortions , those seeking the procedure could now face more out-of-pocket costs .\nThe price for an abortion is rising , and in states with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs to get the procedure elsewhere .\nThis is a particular problem for Black Americans and other racial groups that don \u2019 t have access to as much wealth as their white peers .\n\u201c For Black families who have suffered from multigenerational racism and discrimination , they have not been able to accumulate the same sort of wealth and disposable income , \u201d said Janelle Scott , an education and African American studies professor at the University of California at Berkeley .\n\u201c Their options are just by definition much more limited.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect on Black Americans because of the Supreme Court \u2019 s abortion ruling \u2014 affecting not only the education of the child but also the mother .\nThe birth rate for non-Hispanic Black teens \u2014 25.8 per every 1,000 \u2014 is more than two times the rate for non-Hispanic white teens , according to a 2019 report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .\n\u201c I think we \u2019 re going to start to see increases in teen birth rates , which certainly will contribute to child poverty , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people will get pregnant , and have children , without the means to support them and their ability to complete their schooling in terms of their long-term job and financial well-being.\n\u201d Schools and national leaders should prepare now for the anticipated increase in child poverty , experts say .\nThey can provide low-income school districts with more funding to hire qualified teachers , and educators can find creative ways to teach without the resources of higher-income schools .\n\u201c States need to make decisions right now about taking a close look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that disproportionately harm Black students , \u201d Nellum said .\n\u201c Education systems , no matter where you \u2019 re born in this country , place an undue burden and harm on Black students , \u201d he added .\n\u201c And until we get serious about undoing that , I \u2019 m not sure that Black students anywhere in the country are going to experience the schools that they deserve .\n\u201d",

Black \u2014 has been halted , the result of a lawsuit filed by white farmers who say that the relief is discriminatory .\nFor Gary Grant , a farmer from North Carolina , it \u2019 s the latest sign

\u201d Grant said .\nConducted every five years by the USDA \u2019 s National Agricultural Statistics Service , the Agriculture Census captures farmer and producer demographics , land ownership , income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count of all farms in the United States .\nThe national nonresponse rate for the 2017 Census of Agriculture was nearly 14 % , according to data from the USDA .\nBy comparison , 31

maintains lists to make sure as many farmers receive it as possible , whether they signed up or not .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a response deadline of February 2023 .\nThe data is slated to be released by the summer of 2024 .\nSome Black farmers worry that , in addition to the effects of historical inequities , the lack of information about Black businesses could result in less funding opportunities for them .\nSome \u201c don \u2019 t want to fill out the census form .\nThey don \u2019 t want to put their names down on it because it brings attention to them and their farms , \u201d said JohnElla

because of the low participation rate by farmers of color .\nAware of the tension , building trust with Black farmers is a priority for the Agriculture Department , said statistician Virginia Harris , noting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black farmers are counted for the upcoming census .\n\u201c We know that some farmers , including Black farmers , have had a very uneasy relationship with the USDA over time , \u201d Harris said .\n\u201c The department is committed to serving all farmers .\nAnd one of the things that the Census data allows it to do is to measure how well it is serving all farmers.\n\u201d The USDA \u2019 s $ 4 billion federal loan forgiveness program , adopted under the American Rescue Plan in 2021 , has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , freezing distribution of the debt relief payments to farmers of color .\nThe lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas in April 2021 by Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller and four other white farmers .\nThey sued Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack , arguing that , because the federal aid focuses on socially disadvantaged farmers or ranchers \u2014 excluding white farmers \u2014 the USDA was violating equal

Government action that tears at that fabric and divides its pieces \u2014 rather than reinforcing that fabric \u2019 s unifying and binding ties \u2014 disrupts our common progress toward becoming a more perfect union.\n\u201d In June 2021 , the farmers upped the ante by filing a motion to proceed as a class action lawsuit .\nThe plaintiffs also filed a preliminary injunction that prevented the USDA from proceeding with the program , saying white farmers will \u201c suffer irreparable harm \u201d because the funds will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money .\nAlthough the program is in limbo , the USDA Farm Service Agency still sends notifications to borrowers about their pending loan payments .\nSimilar lawsuits have since been filed against the USDA in Florida , Illinois , Tennessee , and

forgiveness program .\nHolmes recalled at least 58 farmers who applied for it \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgiveness before the lawsuits ensued , she said .\n\u201c That showed us right there that there

Massachusetts .\nThe white-washing of slavery in textbooks dates back to the post-Civil War era , when The United Daughters of the Confederacy advocated for lessons that portrayed of slavery as a largely benevolent institution .\nThe vestige of that effort lives on in some textbooks today , even in Northern classrooms .\nA group of Massachusetts parents were in an uproar in 2014 after discovering a fifth-grade textbook downplayed slavery , stating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in being fair and kind to their slaves.\n\u201d Recently , dozens of states have passed legislation that either limits or expands how race is talked about in the classroom .\nLawmakers in at least 36 states have introduced bills to restrict education on systemic racism , racial bias , and other related topics .\nSeventeen states have proposed legislation that would expand the curriculum on this material , such as providing anti-racial bias training and adding lessons about prominent Black or Asian American

\u2013 have the capacity to recognize those basic truths about slavery : a harsh institution that was problematic for how it treated certain folks.\n\u201d For Rogers , that can be enough of a lesson

some classrooms .\nIt \u2019 s clear that some change is needed : The education that students , receive about slavery is paltry across all grade levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Learning for Justice , an educational resource organization founded by the Southern Poverty Law Center .\nAbout two thirds of surveyed high school students did not know that it took a constitutional amendment to end slavery in the U.S. , and just 8 % of these students could identify slavery as one of the causes of the civil war , according to the analysis .\nAnd because each state \u2019 s board of education is responsible

the end of a two-year payment freeze on student loan repayment .\nSince March 2020 , when the pandemic first thrust the nation into economic uncertainty , Americans with outstanding student loans have been able to bypass their monthly payments without accruing interest or late fees .\nFor Black borrowers , who owe a disproportionate amount of the $ 1.7 trillion in national student loan debt , the end of the pay break will be disastrous .\nDuring his campaign , President Joe Biden pledged to forgive $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many held onto amid the rising costs of goods , job insecurity and a plummeting economy .\nBut whether Biden will follow through on his pledge is uncertain .\nAnd no one is quite sure whether the loan payment freeze will actually end in August .\nThe Biden administration could decide to extend the deadline , as it has done before .\nThe student loan crisis for Black Americans is compounded by a history of economic policies that have targeted them \u2014 from sharecropping , in which white landowners took the bulk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to subprime mortgages and loans that left Black homeowners with astronomically high interest rates .\nIn recent years , for-profit schools have reportedly targeted Black Americans , saddling them with even more debt .\nIn one recent study , which surveyed nearly 1,300 Black borrowers , 64 % said their mental health had been significantly affected by their student loans .\nJalil B. Mustaffa was lead researcher on that study and an author of the related report , \u201c Jim Crow Debt : How Black Borrowers Experience Student Loans , \u201d published by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mustaffa , co-founder of the Equity Research Cooperative consultancy .\nThe conversation below was lightly edited for clarity and length .\nCapital B : For the National Black Student Debt Study , you and your fellow researchers surveyed nearly 1,300 Black borrowers and conducted in-depth interviews with 100 .\nCan you summarize what respondents told you ?\nHow did this debt affect them ?\nJalil B. Mustaffa : When we launched a study and started to hear from Black borrowers , what was clear was that there was this national policy narrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually they \u2019 re good debt .\nAnd one of the big things that Black borrowers pushed back against was this idea of student loans being good debt .\nStudent loans were often described as a debt trap , as predatory .\nOne borrower describes it as absurd to have to take on student loans after knowing this history of Black people being excluded from higher ed .\nThere also was a lot of pushback against what is kind of the No .\n1 reform around student loans : income-driven repayment plans .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt sentences where , yes , they were making payments , but the payments that they could afford were so small that they weren \u2019 t making enough to cover both the principal and their interest .\nThey are still watching their student loans grow over time .\nThe third finding was around the policy conversation of student debt cancellation .\nSo , sometimes , it \u2019 s argued that it shouldn \u2019 t go to those who have graduate degrees .\nIt shouldn \u2019 t go to those who have student debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrowers push back against that , because again , the reality of their experience was that they made all the right choices , but they had to take on the student loans in order to access higher ed .\nIt wasn \u2019 t from being reckless or irresponsible , but the reality was to live and go to school , they had to take on student debt .\nIn this study , you point out that \u201c Black students are more likely to borrow , borrow more , and are more likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can you explain why we \u2019 re seeing this trend ?\nWe have a long history of ongoing practices where the history of U.S. policymaking has really dismantled and extracted the wealth base of Black people .\nHigher education is really sitting right on top of that history of ongoing practices of extracting and dismantling the Black economic and wealth space .\nWhen we create a policy , like student loans , where we offer all groups , across communities and racial groups , the same loan terms , and the same type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience student loans very differently because they are coming from a history of ongoing practices of racism and discrimination .\nEven if we borrow loans on the same terms , we have to borrow more .\nWe have to borrow more to go to institutions that often are more underfunded and lower performing .\nAnd then , when we do manage to graduate , we \u2019 re often entering labor markets to find out that we \u2019 re being underpaid or underemployed .\nSo then , we go get more credentials with really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a buffer against the wage and employment discrimination that we \u2019 re facing .\nIn my opinion , the heart of how you get into a Black student debt crisis is you continue to offer a policy that doesn \u2019 t match the reality or the history of college access , mobility , or the Black experience in our country .\nLet \u2019 s talk about the financial toll : Your study states that Black borrowers owe an average of $ 55,532 in graduate loans , compared to just $ 27,962 for white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sizable chunk of change .\nAre you surprised to see it be that high ?\nWe know that a typical college graduate coming out of a four-year institution is already borrowing around $ 30,000 .\nBut we also know that , when we use words like typical , we often are really talking about an average white student .\nThey may be borrowing $ 30,000 , but they may have a little bit more family income to help pay for higher education .\nWe know that a Black college student is not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they \u2019 re more likely to actually send money back home rather than receive money for higher education .\nThat big growth that we saw , to $ 50,000 , is also because they know that realizing that a bachelor \u2019 s for us is just not enough to get that high quality , well-paying job that we were promised , you know , after we worked hard .\nAnd we know that enrollment in graduate school for black borrowers often is at for-profit institutions , which are more expensive , with lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things come together to create kind of this entanglement of crisis because we \u2019 re navigating a stratified higher ed system , in a stratified labor market .\nSo before we ever sign off for a student loan , we \u2019 re already in this reality , where we \u2019 re going to have to borrow more , and have a much higher hill to climb when it comes to repayment .\nYour study also notes that Black workers need a professional degree to outearn white workers with a bachelor \u2019 s degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black Americans are being put in this position where they \u2019 re stuck between a rock and a hard place .\nI describe it as a \u201c damned if you do , damned if you don \u2019 t \u201d situation .\nYou \u2019 re understanding that there \u2019 s all these different aspects of just the Black experience that will bring you into collision with discrimination , with marginalized opportunity .\nBut you also understand that if you want to have mobility , if you want to have financial stability , that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these things .\nAnd that \u2019 s why we sometimes see Black borrowers going back to graduate school or going to a for-profit school to try to get a quicker credential because they \u2019 re trying to figure out , \u201c How do I navigate economic insecurity or precarity ?\n\u201d And that requires sometimes to just really have to take gambles on higher ed opportunities because that \u2019 s how it \u2019 s been structured .\nSo , of course , many students and many people would prefer to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re going to get their return on their degree when they invest all this money through student debt .\nBut that \u2019 s not the reality where that type of confidence is there , particularly for Black borrowers who are more likely to have for-profit institutions in their communities , they \u2019 re more likely to be intentionally targeted by the institutions .\nAnd then they \u2019 re more likely to enter a labor market where , again , their credentials aren \u2019 t translated in the same way as their white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are already 20 % more likely than white people to experience serious psychological distress due to racism , economic distress , and a host of other societal factors .\nAnd now we \u2019 ve got the mental health toll from this enormous debt .\nHow does that add to that mental health toll ?\nWe should definitely understand student loans , and a larger conversation of mental health , and just larger economic anxieties that are taking place , particularly right now in a moment where we \u2019 re still in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just in the last three years of this pandemic , the amount of stress that someone is under where you enter a pandemic , you \u2019 re not sure if you \u2019 re going to have your job , you \u2019 re not sure if you \u2019 re going to have your health , but you \u2019 re still having this payment being extracted .\nThen the payment is paused .\nAnd every six , eight months , the administration is telling us the loans are coming back .\nSo now you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to figure out how to work this payment back into my budget because things are getting more expensive , increased child care costs .\nAnd people are having to make choices between taking care of themselves , and paying student debt .\nAnd that \u2019 s a really stressful place to be in .\nMany borrowers are experiencing suicidal ideation because of having to make the choices between the student debt that I took on that was supposed to actually benefit me .\nBut now it \u2019 s caused me to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and everyday life planning .\nAnd that is a real mental health toll that I always emphasize : having to carry this weight of not knowing how you will ever pay off this debt .\nSome recommendations your study suggests for helping with the Black student loan debt crisis includes total broad-based debt cancellation and making improvements to income-driven repayment plans .\nHowever , we aren \u2019 t really sure if we \u2019 ll see any of these policies happen .\nWhat do you foresee happening to Black Americans if the payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This has been something that \u2019 s been on the table several times now throughout the pandemic .\nAnd one thing I like to emphasize is that any wins or changes that we have seen with student loans , at least in the last four years , has been really because of a very strong student debt movement where borrowers and advocates have really worked hard to make it clear that student borrowers need relief and that turning on student loans will have serious consequences .\nSo it \u2019 s very possible that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without that extension , I think you \u2019 re dealing with a situation where Black borrowers are going to really face some of the worst consequences of student loans .\nThat \u2019 s what we \u2019 re facing : Back borrowers are going to see that they \u2019 re not able to make this payment .\nThat it \u2019 s not in their budget anymore , because again , everything \u2019 s gotten so much more expensive since we turned these loans off .\nAnd it \u2019 s something that many people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning on because they also have been promised , at the same time , that some debt cancellation is coming .\nSo we have a Biden administration that promised , on the campaign trail , that at least $ 10,000 is gon na be canceled .\nThat hasn \u2019 t happened .\nSo there has been multiple messaging , both from Biden as president-elect and the Biden administration .\nMany people were really counting on the debt cancellation to be a part of their financial planning .\nAnd to turn student loans back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is something that we can \u2019 t really blame the borrower for not being prepared for .\nSo hopefully student loans continue to be paused , and that we continue to advocate and push the Biden administration to understand what consequences , particularly for Black borrowers , could take place if the student loans are turned back on in the middle of a pandemic , and in the middle of higher inflation .", "author":

once-majority Black area \u2014 the epicenter of the 1965 Watts Rebellion and the 1992 uprising following the police beating of Rodney King \u2014 have advocated for investments in Black life for more than 60 years .\nDespite a lack of affordable housing and jobs in Watts , Lee has felt the most peace in his life while living there \u2014 even though he lives in a tent .\nHe is one 50,000 unhoused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all I have , \u201d said Lee , 44 , of his make-shift tent community nestled between an empty lot and one of California \u2019 s most-traveled freeways .\n\u201c This is where I feel at peace , like I \u2019 m most a part of society and a community.\n\u201d ( When asked , Capital B omitted the last names of two unhoused people who are quoted in this story . )\nBut that peace faces an existential threat .\nLee \u2019 s open-air home , divided into a living room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area where it soon may be illegal to sleep in public .\nIt falls into the city \u2019 s newest proposed \u201c anti-camping \u201d jurisdictions , according to a map produced by Kenneth Mejia , a candidate for LA city controller .\nMonths after Los Angeles enshrined its first anti-camping ordinance last fall \u2014 designating 100 areas as off limits to homeless camps \u2014 the City Council is considering expanding the ban to more than 3,000 zones across the expansive metropolis .\nThe law enforcement approach to homelessness has divided the city , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation \u2019 s worst housing crises .\nLos Angeles \u2019 s anti-camping ordinance mirrors others across the country , part of a national movement that \u2019 s targeting public homelessness .\nAt least nine bills have been introduced in six states creating restrictions on homeless encampments with fines , fees , and incarceration for those that do not comply .\nThe Los Angeles ordinance first passed in 1963 as an anti-loitering law before it was amended to become an anti-camping law last year with the support of all but two of the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change , supporters say , was passed in the name of pedestrian safety and cleaning up the city \u2019 s streets .\nBut opponents say the ordinance is meant to \u201c disappear \u201d the homelessness crisis and will push unhoused people deeper into poverty and social instability .\nLos Angeles has already spent $ 2 million to implement its anti-camping zones .\nThe new amendment would make it illegal for people to \u201c sit , lie , or sleep \u201d in areas totaling 90 square miles , or roughly 20 % of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas within 500 feet of all schools ; 2 feet of all fire hydrants ; 5 feet of all \u201c operational \u201d entrances and exits of buildings ; and within 10 feet of driveways .\nThe City Council was slated to vote on expanding the ordinance , known as 41.18 , on Wednesday \u2014 but the vote was delayed .\nDozens of protesters stood outside the chambers chanting \u201c let us in !\n\u201d and many carried signs reading \u201c 41.18=Death.\n\u201d Police were called in to control the situation .\nThe vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle underscores a growing battle over the country \u2019 s public spaces .\nAs housing prices across the country have soared , California serves as ground zero for the homelessness crisis .\nIn Los Angeles , 95 % of voters view homelessness as the city \u2019 s biggest problem .\nPublic policy experts and advocates for the unhoused say the new amendment doubles down on failed policies and overlooks the roots of these crises .\nRace has been largely absent from the conversation , despite being one of the most jarring determinants of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of California \u2019 s Black communities through housing instability and community violence has made Black residents 14 times as likely to be unhoused as white , Latino , and Asian residents combined , according to a Capital B analysis of U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development data .\nAccording to California \u2019 s last expansive homelessness count before the COVID-19 pandemic , the state had roughly 160,000 people living on the streets on any given day .\nIn Los Angeles County alone , there were more than 65,000 people .\nDespite representing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s population , in 2019 , Black people comprised 40 % of the state \u2019 s unhoused population .\nIn Los Angeles County , the number has neared 45 % .\n\u201c Ironically , a state that boasts itself as being progressive is unable to address this reality , \u201d said Marques Vestal , an assistant professor of urban planning at the University of California , Los Angeles , who recently co-authored the report , \u201c The Making Of A Crisis : A History Of Homelessness In Los Angeles.\n\u201d In the report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the policy of policing the homelessness crisis has \u201c unduly \u201d burdened Black unhoused people for decades , sticking them \u201c with fines and ineradicable criminal records.\n\u201d A large part of that burden is physical violence .\nAccording to a 2019 Los Angeles Police Department report , roughly one-third of use-of-force incidents were against unhoused residents , incidents that some fear will become more common if the anti-camping rule is expanded .\nIn Austin , Texas , which passed a similar law in April 2021 , tents have become less common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports .\nBut there also has been a rise in homelessness .\nMore than 250 people have been issued fines and a handful of unhoused people have been arrested , with at least one unhoused woman suing the city for police brutality .\n\u201c The through line of the crises that keep leaving Black folks dispossessed is four centuries of caging people and finding ways to extract their wealth , \u201d said Vestal , a South Central chapter of the Los Angeles Tenants Union member , referring to Los Angeles \u2019 anti-camping ordinance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to homelessness are varied \u2014 incarceration-induced poverty , drug addiction , or being priced out of homes \u2014 many encounter the same challenges in accessing government services .\nBecause the city does not have the manpower to reach every encampment , many never learn about available services .\nFor others , services feel like empty promises .\nA recent Los Angeles Times investigation found that less than 6 % of federally backed housing vouchers given to the city last year to help get people off the streets were actually used .\nWithout addressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s homelessness issue and a simultaneous investment into supportive services , such as affordable housing , health care , and job training , the anti-camping ordinances will continue to meet pushback and fall flat , unhoused residents say .\nIn the Los Angeles neighborhood of Harbor City last week , a Los Angeles County sheriff \u2019 s deputy told Michael S. , an unhoused Black man , that he had two hours to pack up his teal tarp and haul his 99 Cents Only Stores shopping cart away .\nMichael said the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potentially detained if he didn \u2019 t comply , but offered no supportive housing options .\n\u201c They treat me like I \u2019 m the number one suspect , like I did something wrong , \u201d he told Capital B from his tent located in a formerly redlined community , across the street from a polluting oil well .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not a criminal .\nI just found myself in a bad situation.\n\u201d Black Californians have been put in bad situations for generations , Vestal \u2019 s research shows .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Migration , the dream of a fruitful life for Black folks was oversold .\nIn Los Angeles and across the country , discriminatory housing policies \u2014 redlining , exclusionary zoning , and subprime mortgages \u2014 only widened the racial wealth gap and limited any opportunities for housing .\nBlack folks were relegated to environmentally toxic and underdeveloped neighborhoods and excluded from the postwar housing and economic boom afforded to white people .\nAs the Black population in Los Angeles grew tenfold , access to housing did not keep up .\nBy the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angeles already facing a massive housing shortage , unchecked employment discrimination , and economic inequality , the war on drugs dealt a deadly blow .\nSeemingly overnight , the massive increase in policing and lack of access to health care pushed thousands of Black people onto the streets .\nA recent UCLA study suggests that , as the city \u2019 s homeless population grew in the 1990s , there was a \u201c conscious decision \u201d to highlight the white Americans living on the streets \u201c to gain favorable public attention \u201d from residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision helped hide how structural racism was driving the crisis amongst Black residents .\n\u201c To address that relationship between race , property , and wealth inequality , it requires an acknowledgment that inequality is among the founding tenets of American democracy , \u201d he said .\nAs some Black families began to rise above the destruction of redlining and the war on drugs , the 2008 housing crisis emerged .\nA discriminatory home loan process , which made Black families more vulnerable to foreclosure , left Black Californians twice as likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The constant churn of Black Californians building wealth and then losing it is a trademark of the country \u2019 s housing system , Vestal argues .\n\u201c The housing system has created an institutional process that makes us more vulnerable to getting money taken away from us and more vulnerable to violence , \u201d he said .\nIt also has stunted the state \u2019 s Black population .\nSince the war on drugs began , California \u2019 s Black population has been the slowest growing group .\nIn Los Angeles , the share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % to 8 % since 1980 .\nBut the racial discrepancies in the state \u2019 s unhoused population never wavered .\nFor Damien Wilson , an unhoused resident of Los Angeles \u2019 Avalon Gardens neighborhood , the racial disparity in the state \u2019 s homeless population is reminiscent of his time in prison .\nWilson , who has been chronically unhoused since 2017 after 23 years of incarceration , was able to maintain a job cleaning parking lots at local shopping centers for two years until he lost his job during the COVID-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his five years of homelessness , he says no public or private institution has approached him about supportive housing options .\nWhen interviewed by Capital B last week during a heatwave that saw temperatures reach 93 degrees , Wilson lamented the lack of shelters to provide residents reprieve from the heat .\n\u201c We need places where people can wash their hands , take showers , and have somewhere safe to be when it gets this bad , \u201d he said .\n( Following the first COVID-19-related shutdown in Los Angeles , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up 500 hygiene and sanitation stations for unhoused residents , as Wilson suggests , but the units were abandoned , according to a 2021 investigation by the independent digital magazine LA Taco . )\nFor Lee , the lack of supportive options and increased criminalization of homelessness show that elected officials are using an old playbook to tackle the crisis .\nLast year , he abandoned his \u201c permanent supportive housing \u201d unit made available through the nonprofit housing organization Housing Works , because his neighbors \u201c bullied \u201d and \u201c discriminated \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience showed him that the state \u2019 s growing unhoused population \u201c is about more than just being unable to give people housing.\n\u201d \u201c It \u2019 s one thing for the government to say they \u2019 re going to get the housing , \u201d he said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s another thing to help people keep it when it feels like everything in the world is working against them.\n\u201d Standing at the entryway to his tent \u2019 s living room area , equipped with a leather couch , table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee explained some of his experiences resulting from the state \u2019 s massive racial discrepancies in homelessness , incarceration , environmental injustices , mental illness , and addiction .\nHe mentioned fears about air and dust pollution if he is to spend many more months living outside in Watts .\nWhile he has curbed his drug addiction , he now worries about relapsing if he is displaced or , even worse , incarcerated because of the city \u2019 s ordinance .\n\u201c It \u2019 s funny because I don \u2019 t really have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be picky and choosy with my next living environment , \u201d he said .\n\u201c I need to be around people that believe in me , that believe in being friends with your neighbors , \u201d he added .\n\u201c No one cares about community .\n\u201d", "author": "Adam Mahoney", "url": "https://capitalbnews.org/anti-camping-ordinance-california-homeless-racism/",

thinking about how to evacuate with her elderly parents in the middle of a pandemic , a task made more difficult because of unsafe conditions at public emergency shelters and price-gouging at hotels with limited availability .\nUltimately , she stayed and watched the storm eviscerate her community .\nThe destruction never seemed to stop \u2014 just over a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by yet another major hurricane , Delta .\nHundreds of homes and businesses around Guidry ceased to exist .\nThe retired couple next door is living in a trailer outside of their storm-damaged house .\nMore than 700 days since Hurricane Laura , they \u2019 re still waiting for their insurance company to pay out their policy .\nGuidry \u2019 s own home survived Laura well enough to safely live in it , but the structure has sustained tens of thousands of dollars worth of damage in floods since then .\nPrivate insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Guidry says , and it \u2019 s unclear when funds from the state-run program Restore Louisiana will be made available to her .\nIf another storm hits the community before she can repair her home , she questions how she will be able to stay in her home of 43 years .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve thought about if I have to evacuate again for a storm , that I may not come back , \u201d she said .\nThe experience pushed Guidry to use her expertise as a lawyer to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private insurance process .\nThe effort revealed to her a critical inadequacy of these systems to address the growing threats of climate change .\nThere are many \u201c holes and gaps , \u201d she said , that leave people like herself under-protected by federal support and private insurance .\n\u201c While natural disasters do not ever discriminate , recovery always does , \u201d Guidry said from her home , which has sustained an estimated $ 80,000 in storm damages .\n\u201c This happens in every city across the nation ; it doesn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes to recovering , everybody \u2019 s traumatized \u2014 we \u2019 re all going through the same thing , but recovery will always come first to the areas where the higher tax base is.\n\u201d Hurricane Laura \u2014 and the two years \u2019 worth of major weather events that have struck Louisiana since then \u2014 has highlighted a hurricane-sized hole in the country \u2019 s ability to keep its residents housed .\nGovernment agencies have fallen short in supporting evacuations during storms , often failing to open up enough shelters , offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform warning system .\nBut even after the immediate crisis ends , another begins , as weather-battered communities try to rebuild .\nThe private home insurance industry in Louisiana is crumbling as multiple companies have gone bankrupt or stopped insuring homes in the state \u2019 s most destruction-prone regions .\nAnd funding for housing repairs has failed to keep up with growing demand in coastal communities hit with multiple disasters per year , creating an imbalance in housing supply and demand .\nThe burden of the crisis has fallen on low-income people and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies relegated Black and brown residents to areas most likely to be hit by extreme weather events .\nWhen those disasters strike , renters are ineligible for most supportive funding options and find themselves at the mercy of their landlords .\nAnd the extensive \u2014 sometimes yearslong \u2014 process to receive government support for damaged property has often left Black homeowners behind .\n\u201c As storms hit Louisiana , the government failed to provide adequate assistance for low-income renters , failed to get homeowners the support they needed , and now we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andreanecia Morris , executive director of the housing advocacy nonprofit HousingNOLA .\n\u201c The safety net of \u2018 housing for all \u2019 to protect families during the pandemic is gone.\n\u201d Following a weather disaster , Americans \u2019 support options fall into a few categories : federal support provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Housing and Urban Development ; state support through institutions like the Louisiana Department of Insurance ; and private support from insurance companies like State Farm .\nFederal and state options often favor wealthier residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wade through the long and complicated reimbursement process .\nSimilarly , private insurers can be expensive , pricing out renters and lower-income homeowners .\nResearch has shown that FEMA \u2019 s funding also supports white disaster victims more than people of color , regardless of the damage a family faces .\nEven when Black residents receive aid , white people who receive the same amount of federal assistance see their wealth rise , while Black residents see their wealth decline following disaster , a recent study by Rice University found .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts and Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi introduced the FEMA Equity Act to address these discrepancies , but a divided Congress has stalled it .\nIn Louisiana , Morris , the New Orleans-based housing advocate , outlined several ways FEMA has failed along racial lines .\nMost shockingly , she says , the government continues to \u201c struggle in getting trailers deployed to rural Black communities \u201d for hurricanes Laura and Delta , which hit nearly two years ago .\nSince last October , HUD has made about $ 2.3 billion available to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 500 million earmarked for Lake Charles .\n( According to Louisiana Gov .\nJohn Bel Edwards , that still leaves the state needing roughly $ 1 billion for repairs . )\nBut , as the New York Times reports , HUD and FEMA often work against each other .\nFEMA typically limits temporary housing options for residents to a mere 18 months , but HUD generally takes two to four years to dish out money to residents for their home repairs .\nWhile federal funds have been hard to come by , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have lost their private home insurance .\nThis year , six insurance companies discontinued their Louisiana services before fully paying out their insurance policies to residents , while 50 more limited their services in the state \u2019 s hardest-hit regions .\nEarlier this month , a state judge ruled that the insurance companies are not responsible for paying out certain expenses owed to residents .\nIn the aftermath , those fortunate enough to still have a private insurance plan have reported that their yearly rates have tripled .\nThat gap in federal assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left some Louisiana communities with more residents than available housing .\nAs a result , apartments and houses have become increasingly expensive in a tight housing market .\nMany families have been left in a challenging situation where it is too expensive to repair their current home and too costly to find a new one .\nSince 2020 , an estimated 25,000 homes in the state have been destroyed by storms .\nThat , combined with general inflation , has raised the state \u2019 s average price to buy a home by 22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumped 18 % .\nThe Bayou State is not an anomaly .\nAs housing prices reach all-time highs , roughly one-third of the nation \u2019 s housing stock is at high risk for disasters .\nIn an interview last year with Grist , Morris said , \u201c Climate change is also a housing crisis.\n\u201d The housing shortage and rising prices have prompted migration out of the region .\nSince 2020 , Lake Charles \u2014 which is 50 % Black and surrounded by oil refineries \u2014 has lost a greater share of residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMost residents , however , are not leaving the state , but moving north to Louisiana communities where housing is more accessible .\nAn uptick in deaths from COVID-19 and work-from-home policies also have played a role in the population decline , but Guidry argues that population loss was largely driven by the region \u2019 s \u201c unfathomable \u201d amount of disasters .\n\u201c One thing people don \u2019 t understand is after a storm , the best thing that you could do is go somewhere where you don \u2019 t have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for funds to rebuild , \u201d Guidry explained .\n\u201c This is not a luxury for most people , however , because most people live paycheck to paycheck , and recovery funds aren \u2019 t guaranteed .\nSo you \u2019 re forced to pack up and move with whatever little money you have and try to rebuild a life , most often , in poverty.\n\u201d Guidry \u2019 s work has included pushing landlords to rebuild and repair their rental properties while retaining the same tenants .\nAfter hurricanes , it is common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guise of remodeling and rebuilding battered units before driving up their rents to attract wealthier lessees .\nThe situation in Lake Charles , which has garnered attention from President Joe Biden , exemplifies the country \u2019 s inability to adapt to climate change , said Morris .\n\u201c When COVID first started , there was this big focus on keeping people in their homes , \u201d she said .\n\u201c But it \u2019 s obvious we had blinders on facing climate change \u2019 s role in accessing housing .\n\u201d", "author": "Adam Mahoney", "url": "https://capitalbnews.org/louisiana-fema-private-insurance-housing-crisis-hurricane-season/", "published": "Wed, 03 Aug 2022 11:00:00 +0000", "published_utc": 1659538800, "collection_utc": 1659527601}, {"id": "capitalbnews--2022-08-05--Meet Maxwell Frost.

Madison Cawthorn ( R-N.C. ) as the youngest member of Congress .\nFrost \u2019 s race is crowded .\nHe faces nine other Democrats .\nBut his campaign has raised more than $ 1.2 million \u2014 more than all of his August primary opponents combined .\nHis Democratic opponents include Florida state Sen. Randolph Bracy , the Rev .\nTerence Gray , and attorney Natalie Jackson .\nAnd his campaign has snagged endorsements from U.S. Sen. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson , and Florida state Rep. Anna Eskamani .\nThe primary election will take place Aug. 23 .\nFrost spoke to Capital B about why his campaign is so deeply rooted in health advocacy and how his past work in activism and organizing influences his politics .\nThe interview is edited for clarity and length .\nCapital B : You \u2019 re the minimum age to serve in the U.S. House , what about being part of Generation Z sparked your candidacy ?\nMaxwell Frost : Me being a member of Gen Z @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role in me deciding to win , but it \u2019 s obviously a big part of the story and something that I think about quite often , especially , potentially being the first of my generation in the institution .\nWe \u2019 re moving into a place where the voices of young people are respected and are accepted .\nDemocrats need to do a much better job of accepting young voices .\nRepublicans have more young people proportionately in leadership positions .\nOnly 7 % of House Democrats are under the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just talking about a 20-year-old .\nI \u2019 m talking about under 40 .\nThere \u2019 s a lot of work that needs to be done .\nYour campaign is pretty health-focused .\nA lot of what you \u2019 re campaigning on is health-related .\nWhy is health important to you at this moment ?\nWe take a very holistic approach to policy .\nThat means not viewing issues in silos or accepting the division of issues .\nWhen you think about health care , gun violence , climate change , crime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place .\nOur opposition wants us to believe in that because , if we divide the issues , it means we \u2019 re also divided in organizing and power building .\nAll of these issues are interconnected .\nIn the campaign , we don \u2019 t go up to people and say , \u201c I \u2019 m for Medicare For All.\n\u201d A lot of times , I \u2019 ll ask , \u201c Do you believe in the human right to be healthy ?\n\u201d Most people say yes .\nBy virtue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy .\nThat means preventative care .\nThat means reactive care .\nThat means mental care .\n\u201c Do you believe that we still deserve that regardless of employment status ?\n\u201d Most people say yes .\n\u201c Do you believe that we deserve that regardless of how much money we have in our bank ?\n\u201d Most people say yes .\nWhen we pass something like Medicare For All , we \u2019 ll see more money in people \u2019 s pockets , as well as our population healthier and cared for .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence go down .\nYou \u2019 ll see things like crime go down .\nYou \u2019 ll see the ability to really hone in on existential issues , like climate change , go up .\nGun violence is an issue that \u2019 s been close to you .\nHow is your own personal perspective intertwined with gun violence , and how does that relate to this conversation of community health ?\nGun violence is what got me involved in this work .\nTen years ago , the Sandy Hook shooting happened , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThat changed my life .\nThree years later , I would be caught in the middle of gun violence as well , and it would hit home for me again when the Pulse nightclub shooting happened here in Orlando .\nWe lose 100 people a day in this country due to gun violence .\nWhen you really take a step back , and you don \u2019 t let yourself be desensitized to the news , then you understand that behind every number there \u2019 s a person \u2014 and that person has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it really hits home .\nAnd in some ways , the moment of your candidacy has come full circle with the Uvalde and Buffalo shootings earlier this summer .\nHow does that feel for you ?\nIt \u2019 s a morbid irony , right ?\nThe thing that got me involved with this work was a school shooting at an elementary school with a kid with an AR-15 .\nI \u2019 m running for Congress 10 years later and , in the middle of my campaign , a kid goes into elementary school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids .\nThis was predictable because it already happened .\nIt was preventable because we have commonsense gun reform that could be passed .\nIt is a policy failure .\nEach Black and brown boy or girl that \u2019 s killed because of drive-by shootings in their neighborhood where they live , every person who takes a gun and kills themselves , these are all policy failures .\nMass shootings tear families apart , and it \u2019 s horrible .\nIt \u2019 s also 1 % of gun violence .\nI say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play up the whole issue .\nYour roots are in activism and organizing .\nHow do you feel like that bleeds into your journey as a candidate , and also , Washington , if you \u2019 re elected ?\nI \u2019 ll be going into office as someone who \u2019 s always been on the other side of the wall , always working to hold people accountable .\nI \u2019 m not naive \u2014 I know that a lot of times , folks on the outside will say , \u201c I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited to have one of the most accessible congressional offices in the country .\nWe \u2019 re going to knock on doors year round , not to get me elected , but to connect people with resources in the community .\nIs there anything I didn \u2019 t ask that you think is really important , or that you want to make sure we talk about ?\nA big part of this campaign is to redefine what it means to be a politician .\nI \u2019 ll always ask people , \u201c What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you hear the word politician ?\n\u201d Corrupt .\nJail .\nOut of touch .\nWe laugh about it , and then we \u2019 ll sit in silence .\nIt \u2019 s funny , but it \u2019 s sad .\nWe \u2019 re talking about people who make decisions that impact our life .\nWhen you think about your representative , you should smile .\nYou should think of someone who you not only respect , but someone that you love , and someone that loves you .\nWe \u2019 re always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody , you want them to have health care .\nIf you love somebody , you want them to live in a community free of gun violence .\nIf you love somebody , you want them to have affordable housing , and when that love transforms into kind of a righteous anger , you take that anger everywhere you go .\nTo Congress .\nTo protests .\nIt gives you motivation .\nThat \u2019 s a new type of politics , different from what we see now .\nWhen I say new generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young people .\nThere \u2019 s a lot of older folks who are not in power right now who carry that same torch .\nHonestly , I feel like that answer is right along the lines of how organizing influences your work .\nLove is something that an organizer turned politician would emulate .\n100 % .\nThese things are really complicated .\nNo matter if you \u2019 re Republican or Democrat , progressive or not , you connect with love , and you understand what that means .\nWe need some more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to leave with my constituents knowing that they deserve the best .\nThey deserve it all because they \u2019 re human .\nThat \u2019 s it .", "author": "Margo Snipe", "url":

Fenton Jr. , who was recently announced as the White House national monkeypox response coordinator .\nIn response to a request for comment from Capital B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CDC said in a statement that , \u201c while anyone can get monkeypox , available data indicate that monkeypox has disproportionately affected sexually active gay and bisexual men and racial and ethnic minority groups .\nThese communities must be empowered with information to make informed decisions about their health \u2014 not stigmatized.\n\u201d When asked why these disparities were not discussed or mentioned in Thursday \u2019 s call , Kristen Nordlund , a CDC representative , said the agency \u201c has released data like this previously , as late as last week in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the public and that media can attend.\n\u201d Read more : Everything You Need to Know About Monkeypox The wide variation in racial and ethnic disparities of monkeypox from place to place is likely a result of structural racism and institutional barriers , said Dr. Sabrina Assoumou , an infectious disease physician at Boston Medical Center .\nThat includes local policy decisions such as Medicaid expansion .\n\u201c Infectious diseases tend to exploit existing structural issues and impact communities that have been historically excluded , \u201d she said .\n\u201c To address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy solutions.\n\u201d Some experts fear the racial disparities in monkeypox cases could be even greater than the data shows , given race and ethnicity haven \u2019 t been recorded for a significant number of cases .\nIt \u2019 s likely that some monkeypox infections are going undiagnosed , said Blackstock , especially within communities with high rates of poverty , lack of health insurance , and other structural barriers to care .\nThose barriers can prompt lower rates of testing and treatment due to fear of racism or homophobia from clinicians .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ it actually helps everyone .\nEveryone wins in the end , \u201d she said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s unfortunate that there hasn \u2019 t been an explicit discussion of how the response is taking equity , and in particular racial equity , into account.\n\u201d The monkeypox disparities appear to be similar to those from the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic , when it became clear Black folks were catching the virus and dying at alarming rates .\nIt was a trend that shocked some Americans who , following the murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2020 , were paying attention to how racism affects health outcomes .\nNow , in the third year of the coronavirus pandemic , the conversation surrounding racial equity in public health response has dwindled .\n\u201c Monkeypox was really our opportunity to show what we learned from COVID , \u201d said Dr. Stella Safo , a New York City-based primary care physician .\n\u201c We \u2019 re failing in our public health and our federal and local responses.\n\u201d On his first day in office , President Joe Biden signed an executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. , including within the health care system .\nLess than a month later , with clear data showing the coronavirus was devastating Black communities , his administration announced a COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force .\nThe individuals selected came from a range of racial and ethnic backgrounds .\nThe monkeypox outbreak has prompted a far less robust response to racial health inequities .\nIn the announcement of leadership for the national monkeypox response team , which was released in early August , there was no mention of the racial disparities in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustrated that there wasn \u2019 t a Black or Latino queer man or person on the leadership , \u201d said Blackstock .\n\u201c That struck me immediately.\n\u201d While the virus is spreading most rapidly within the Black , Latino , and LGBTQ communities , anyone can get it and everyone should be alert , experts said .\nThe country is facing a \u201c critical inflection point \u201d that requires a more aggressive response , said FDA Commissioner Robert Califf in Thursday \u2019 s briefing .\nOfficials from the CDC , Department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House were also on the call .\nMonkeypox , unlike COVID-19 , does not spread easily and remains relatively rare .\nAnd while it is not exclusively a sexually transmitted infection , it

Breonna Taylor \u2019 s death in Louisville , Kentucky , in 2020 involved a no-knock warrant .\nThe City Council later banned such warrants , and as part of the settlement negotiations in her family \u2019 s wrongful death lawsuit , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that included a requirement for commanders to review search warrants before seeking a judge \u2019 s approval .\nThe Justice Department announced indictments on Aug. 4 against four current and former officers for federal civil rights violations , conspiring to cover up the creation of a false affidavit to obtain a search warrant for Taylor \u2019 s home , and other charges .\nData is critical for reform efforts , but withholding it allows room for plausible deniability that discrimination in policing exists , said Joshua Byrd , a criminal law professor at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to \u201c have a level of control in society .\n\u2026 So it \u2019 s not going to be to their advantage to sort of put out data that might have some sort of negative connotations , or ideas about racism , sexism , or any other -ism , \u201d said Byrd , who also serves as committee chair for the Anti-Gun Violence Committee of the 100 Black Men of Atlanta .\n\u201c One smart way to keep control is to not provide the right data.\n\u201d Recent legislative efforts to improve tracking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent organizations have taken up the effort , relying on news accounts and police reports to compile their own databases of fatal encounters with law enforcement .\nThe Washington Post has been logging fatal shootings since 2015 , and found that Black Americans are killed by police at twice the rate of white Americans .\nA separate database , Mapping Police Violence , went a step further , seeking to compile all deadly police encounters .\nThe project by Campaign Zero , a police reform activist group , determined that Black people were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed by law enforcement than white Americans .\nThe FBI database goes beyond fatal incidents to encompass a broader array of police violence , including tasers and physical restraint , even when the encounters don \u2019 t turn deadly .\nBut still , the federal data is often incomplete and messy .\n\u201c It is extremely important for data to be as transparent and accessible as possible , and that means that it has to be collected in a way that will be able to be analyzed , to understand trends , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how police engage individuals who are accused of certain types of incidents , \u201d said Sakira Cook , the co-interim vice president of campaigns for Color of Change , a nonprofit civil rights advocacy organization .\nA 2021 FBI report looked at a subset of extreme cases \u2014 active shootings \u2014 and analyzed how often they ended in the arrest , suicide , or killing of the suspect .\nBut the report excluded certain categories of common gun violence , such as domestic and gang-related incidents .\nIt also did not report the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the absence of racial data in the report , Capital B used public records , news reports , and mugshots to identify the races of 53 of the 61 suspects in the FBI \u2019 s active shooter report .\nAmong those identified , Black suspects were nearly three times as likely to be killed by police as white suspects , though white suspects were significantly more likely to die by suicide during an active shooting incident .\nBut even this federal data is questionable .\nCapital B found several active shooting incidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t included in the FBI \u2019 s report .\nAnd some of the 61 incidents it included didn \u2019 t fit the report \u2019 s definition of an active shooter : \u201c one or more individuals actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill in a populated area.\n\u201d For instance , one incident included in the report was about a 12-year-old girl who was detained by a teacher until police arrived after she allegedly shot three people at school .\nCapital B asked the FBI why that case was characterized as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declined to respond .\nThough there \u2019 s limited data on racial disparities in law enforcement \u2019 s use of force , there is some understanding of what contributes to the disparities .\nByrd , a former deputy sheriff for the DeKalb County Sheriff \u2019 s Office , said officers are given a wide range of discretion when it comes to using force .\nIf they feel that their life \u2014 or another person \u2019 s life \u2014 is in danger , use of deadly force is legally viewed as justified .\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers are shooting and killing individuals \u2014 especially Black people \u2014 \u201c because of how they feel \u201d instead of the reality of the threat .\nBecause of racial stereotypes and media portrayals of Black people as violent , police \u201c already feel like they \u2019 re threatened , they already feel like they are dangerous , \u201d Byrd said , \u201c and now they are acting on what they call their subconscious or implicit bias.\n\u201d Implicit bias training sessions are offered to law enforcement officers , including prosecutors , across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this training , says law enforcement officers often don \u2019 t want to acknowledge the idea of having an implicit bias against Black people that might prompt them to shoot first and ask questions later .\nA related dynamic could play a role in active shooter situations , as well .\nData in the FBI report suggests that white shooters more frequently commit suicide , while Black shooters are more often killed by police \u2014 a possible disparity that could be influenced by cultural differences , said Rheeda Walker , a licensed clinical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least most Black folks in the U.S. , know that interactions with the police could be lethal , \u201d Walker said , which could lead to desperate attempts of the theory of \u201c suicide by cop \u201d as an alternative to taking one \u2019 s own life .\n\u201c Culture is how you make sense of things , and if how you make sense of things is , \u2018 I can \u2019 t take my own life , but I am a struggling individual who sees no hope for the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me to do this act of violence and for someone else to end my life than for me to do that , \u201d Walker said .\nBut because of the lack of data and psychological autopsies conducted , particularly on Black people , Walker cautioned that she can \u2019 t definitively conclude whether \u201c suicide by cop \u201d explains the potential racial disparities in active shooter cases .\nFor years , civil rights advocates have urged improvements in public reporting of demographics of civilians who encounter police officers , whether they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying that it \u2019 s important to expose any unjust patterns and practices within a department .\nColor of Change is among the organizations that have championed the call for mandatory collection of law enforcement data .\n\u201c The number one thing is to press the FBI to collect data publicly , analyze the data on an annual basis and to make recommendations not only to the agency , but to Congress about how to address some of the disparities that exist in what the data tells us , \u201d Cook said .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ with respect to who didn \u2019 t get taken into custody.\n\u201d In 2020 , U.S. Rep. Karen Bass of California introduced the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act that included several police reforms and accountability measures , including a national database that would track police misconduct .\nThe bill would have required law enforcement agencies to provide a demographic breakdown to the attorney general of incidents in which use-of-force and other police practices , such as traffic-violation stops , occurred .\nThat information would have gone into a national police misconduct database @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a DOJ-hosted website .\nThe bill collapsed last fall when Democratic and Republican senators couldn \u2019 t reach an agreement on some elements of the legislation .\nThough congressional efforts to address the data have died , activists have continued the fight .\n\u201c It is critically important that the data exists , the data is public , in order for us to put forth solutions and structural changes that will improve the ways in which Black people , specifically , experience the criminal legal system in this country , \u201d Cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s inequitable .\nWe know it is racist .\n\u201d", "author": "Christina Carrega", "url":

Everyone\u2019: How Two Formerly Incarcerated Firefighters Are Building a Movement", "content": "On the heels of the largest wildfire season in California \u2019 s modern history , Royal Ramey traded in his work on the scorched mountainsides for an office desk in San Bernardino .\nHe had been battling wildfires for a decade , among the thousands of incarcerated Californians who were trained by the correctional system and paid well below minimum wage to help contain the state \u2019 s increasingly deadly blazes .\nNow , as temperatures in Southern California reach triple digits , Ramey says his air-conditioned office at the bottom of the parched San Bernardino National Forest is markedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once spent nearly 24 hours a day .\nNot only does he go home to his family after work , he also helps people use the skills they gained in prison to build full-time \u2014 and fully paid \u2014 wildland firefighting careers .\nLooking down at a set of pristinely clean firefighting tools on his office floor , Ramey said , \u201c I got a desire and love for fire , but also love and desire to help people.\n\u201d Ramey has helped more than 170 formerly incarcerated people join the ranks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through his nonprofit organization , the Forestry and Fire Recruitment Program .\nCo-founded in 2015 with Brandon Smith , who trained with Ramey at the Bautista Adult Conservation Fire Camp in Riverside County , the program provides training and job connections for people who worked in California prison fire camps .\nRamey said his program fills many crucial needs : combatting the more frequent impacts of climate disasters , while helping formerly incarcerated people re-enter the workforce .\nIt also reminds the world that no person should be defined by their greatest mistake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fulfill your purpose , and when we think about the environment , climate change , and building community , we need better examples of how to do so , \u201d said Ramey .\n\u201c We \u2019 re out here building structural support for people to be successful and make a difference in this world despite barriers put in front of them.\n\u201d More than 5,000 wildfires have ravaged California this year .\nThat number could increase by about 20 % in the next two decades , according to a 2021 study , requiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovery and making homes and power grids more climate resilient .\nThrough his own work combatting the impacts of climate change , Ramey said he \u2019 s learned that it is \u201c very imperative that we become stewards of the land we \u2019 re on.\n\u201d It also has revealed a deep connection between human-caused climate change , the country \u2019 s use of the prison system , and racial inequality .\n\u201c In Black and Latino communities we \u2019 re told our lives are disposable , \u201d he said , \u201c just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between disposability and climate change has made using incarcerated people to fight fires even more complicated .\nFor decades , California has relied on fire crews of quickly trained inmates \u2014 mostly Black or Latino \u2014 to perform some of the most backbreaking work in firefighting : plowing and cutting through brush in suffocating temperatures to create perimeters to contain the flames .\nImprisoned people make up roughly one-third of California \u2019 s wildland firefighting workforce .\nThe United States has a history of using its Black citizens to do the dirty work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II , as the Japanese army used \u201c balloon bombs \u201d in attempts to destroy America \u2019 s western forests , an all-Black U.S. Army paratrooper group known as \u201c smokejumpers \u201d spent months \u201c saving the American West \u201d and fighting fires .\nBut there are benefits to California \u2019 s prison fire camps , Ramey says .\nWhile incarcerated , he and Smith fell in love with fighting fire and the feeling of being needed .\n\u201c We need firefighters , and to be doing a job that is needed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d he said .\n\u201c Purpose is something they take from you in prison ; this gives it back.\n\u201d Firefighting is among the highest-paid jobs for state prisoners : Fire camp detainees earn around $ 5 a day , with an additional $ 1- $ 2 an hour when assigned to active fires .\nThe conditions at the camp are also better than the average state-run facility .\nNamely , participants can be out in the \u201c real world \u201d rather than in a cell all day .\n\u201c It works in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ours , \u201d Ramey said .\n\u201c As an incarcerated person , you \u2019 re already of the mindset , \u2018 I \u2019 m already in prison .\nI \u2019 m already in an environment where there \u2019 s threats each and every day , so I might be better taking a chance on this threat [ of firefighting ] .\n\u201d But many advocates argue that incarcerated laborers should receive a living wage , contending that the pay does not match the dangers of the job .\nSeveral prisoners in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died in the field over the last decade .\nThe program has also opened up conversations around race and privilege within the wildland firefighting field .\nWhile incarcerated laborers are primarily Black or Latino , the professional firefighters who work the same fires are almost exclusively white .\nUsing prison labor saves the state roughly $ 100 million annually in comparison to what professional firefighters are paid .\nSeeing the racial disparities in the field , Ramey and Smith knew that they wanted to continue fighting fire after they were released .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Once released from prison , there was no roadmap for incarcerated laborers to make a career out of the skills they learned .\nOne of the biggest barriers , Ramey explained , is a California law that bars those with felony convictions from earning the emergency medical certification that most municipal fire departments require .\nIt was \u201c egregious , \u201d Smith said in a 2020 interview with KQED News .\n\u201c You have this labor pool of people that are just sitting here and underutilized only because [ of ] an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and experience in the field , Smith and Ramey had to start at square one to build a career in wildland firefighting after being released .\nIt would take them roughly three years to climb back to a position equal to their role while incarcerated .\nAfter being denied from a handful of crews , it wouldn \u2019 t be until the summer of 2015 when a state emergency declaration opened up an easier pathway for hundreds of people , including themselves , to join the professional ranks .\nNeeding more bodies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record-breaking fire season , the hiring process was temporarily made much easier .\nThroughout the ordeal , the pair prioritized going to prison fire camps and talking to incarcerated people about finding jobs in the Forest Service once they were released .\nThey saw a need to put their \u201c work on paper \u201d and institutionalize a program connecting recently released prisoners with professional firefighting posts .\nThrough their nonprofit , they partner with local governments to give on-the-job training for formerly incarcerated people , help people with state firefighting applications , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navigating the difficult process .\nIn less than six months , participants in the FFRP program receive the same training they would get in a yearslong state firefighting academy \u2014 and they \u2019 re paid at least $ 15 an hour .\nTraining includes field work , hiking , practicing plowing and cutting down fields , and equipment training in their new San Bernardino office .\nIn addition to the paid transitional work in fire prevention , the program provides formerly incarcerated people access to social workers who help ease their reentry process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to housing and mental health care .\nIn 2020 , Ramey and Smith were influential in getting California Gov .\nGavin Newsom to sign a law that made it easier for prison camp fire crews to have their records expunged in hopes of removing a significant barrier to seeking a job as a firefighter .\nIn April , the pair received a $ 250,000 private foundation grant to expand the program to other parts of the state beyond Southern California .\n\u201c I think that the world is finally accepting that we \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex folks , to address the situations we created and have tried to keep quiet , \u201d said Ramey .\n\u201c We got to acknowledge our weaknesses and mistakes and say that it is OK to work on them as individuals because we need everyone to combat the world \u2019 s issues.\n\u201d That kind of community rehabilitation , he says , will help quell and contain more fires than just the ones ripping through California .\n\u201c What are we doing if not trying to make this world a better place ?\n@", "author": "Adam Mahoney", "url":

The Unequal Burden of the Student Debt Crisis", "content": "The pause on student loan payments is scheduled to end Aug. 31 , and millions of Americans are contending with the prospect of another burdensome monthly expense .\nDozens of Democratic lawmakers have publicly called for a seventh extension on the payment freeze , and many experts believe that the Biden administration will oblige .\nBut for Black Americans , who owe a disproportionate amount of the $ 1.7 trillion in national student loan debt , the student debt crisis is more complex .\nIt is compounded by a history of oppressive economic policies \u2014 from sharecropping to subprime mortgages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a financial weight on Black Americans well before the pandemic era .\nThat \u2019 s one reason why conversations about the loan crisis have moved beyond the freeze to more sweeping policies that cancel debts .\nThe NAACP , along with some Democratic leaders , support canceling as much as $ 50,000 in loans per borrower , a level that the civil rights organization says would \u201c fuel upward mobility in the Black community and equitable efforts to close the racial wealth gap.\n\u201d \u201c We have to do something about the student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a research professor and chief economist at Georgetown University .\n\u201c It \u2019 s unacceptable .\nIt \u2019 s untenable .\nAnd it \u2019 s really too burdensome on American adults.\n\u201d Here \u2019 s what you need to know about the student loan debt crisis .\nIs there a significant difference in how many student loans Black and white borrowers take out ?\nWhy ?\nOne analysis of federal data found that nearly 87 % of Black college students borrowed federal loans to attend a four-year college , compared to less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just one year after graduation , Black borrowers owed an estimated $ 39,043 one year after graduation \u2013 compared to just $ 28,661 borrowed by white students , according to a recent study from the Education Trust .\nBy the 12-year mark , the average white borrower has successfully paid off 35 % of their debt , while the Black borrower isn \u2019 t even close : They typically end up owing 13 % more than what they originally borrowed .\nMost experts point to one major issue behind this disparity : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn to student loans because their parents can \u2019 t foot the bill for their higher education .\n\u201c Parental wealth was a primary explanatory variable for differences in debt accumulation between white and Black borrowers , \u201d explains Fenaba R. Addo , an associate professor of public policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill .\nThey \u201c have to turn to credit markets , financial aid , or loan-based financial aid to make up the difference.\n\u201d Why were student loan payments paused ?\nWill people have to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergence of the coronavirus hit the economy and caused many Americans to lose or leave their jobs , the Trump administration started a loan forbearance program that let Americans avoid paying off student loans without accruing interest .\nThe Biden administration has extended the payment freeze four times , with the latest extension set to end Aug. 31 .\nNo one is entirely sure whether the administration will extend it again .\nBut many are hopeful .\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that the Department of Education told student loan servicers to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c We need to think about the context in which the payment freeze came , because of the COVID pandemic , and I think we \u2019 ve kept postponing it because of the surges and new variants , \u201d Addo said .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a lot of talk now about a recession \u2014 so it may get postponed , again , due to factors that are creating uncertainty in the labor market and the economy.\n\u201d How would the end of the payment freeze impact Black Americans ?\nIt depends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back .\nBut with concerns about a possible recession , it could create significant financial hardships for many .\n\u201c I think we \u2019 re gon na see a lot of people not paying their loans because of their own financial hardships and ability to do so , \u201d Addo said .\nThis loan delinquency , according to Addo , will \u201c disproportionately fall along racial lines.\n\u201d Many Americans have recovered from the economic calamity that came with the pandemic , when unemployment and poverty rates jumped .\nBut it left some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c To just flip a switch and say , \u2018 OK , now we \u2019 re over .\nWe have to get back to normal \u2019 \u2014 but it is not normal now , \u201d Addo said .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s going to be hard for a lot of people.\n\u201d Smith added that even if a borrower is able to make their monthly payments , it could still wreak havoc on their lives \u2014 and the broader economy .\n\u201c This is something that cuts into your disposable income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on a macro level , it really reduces the extent of [ gross domestic product ] creation , GDP formation , consumption spending \u2014 all of that is on the decline if you don \u2019 t have that much money to buy cars , or homes , or engage in that aspect of the economy.\n\u201d Besides extending the payment freeze , what else can be done to relieve the weight of the student debt crisis ?\nThe Biden administration has been considering other policies to address the debt crisis , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that borrowers took out .\nEducation Department officials are reportedly developing plans to cancel $ 10,000 of student loan debt for millions of Americans , according to recent reporting from Politico .\nThe process would involve an online application for eligible borrowers .\nThat amount falls far short of the $ 50,000 that advocates and civil rights groups , like the NAACP , have called for .\nBut policy experts have said that forgiving large amounts of debt could come with economic consequences such as inflation \u2014 which already is burdening many Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that Biden and his administration \u201c haven \u2019 t made a decision yet \u201d on student loan cancellation , but plan to do so within the next couple of weeks .\nSmith also refers to the gainful employment initiative started by the Obama administration and later repealed during President Donald Trump \u2019 s term .\nThe program incentivized for-profit colleges to ensure its students were educated for employment afterward , according to the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities .\n\u201c Am I gainfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I take the student loan out , can I get a job that pays off the student loan ?\nSo it \u2019 s good debt if you follow a good degree , get a good occupation.\n\u201d For Addo , the best solution is a policy change that will get rid of loans altogether .\n\u201c I think what the last few years have done is increased that glimmer of hope that something can be done about it , \u201d she said .\nDo experts think Black Americans should avoid loans altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the $ 1.7 trillion student loan debt , and the particular way it affects most Black Americans , experts still think taking out loans for school is worthwhile .\n\u201c It \u2019 s still the only way for you to pay for college , \u201d Smith said .\n\u201c The question for me remains : Now you have to ask yourself real questions about making sure that once you enter , you exit .\nYou can \u2019 t not graduate .\nYou have to get into school .\nYou have to graduate from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that you take a degree of value , so you get a good job .\n\u201d", "author": "Giulia Heyward", "url":

clean energy efforts .\nBut while the sweeping measure takes historic steps to address climate issues , some environmental experts have called out its failure to address generations of discrimination against Black farmers .\nAfter Congress promised last year to help right some historical wrongs with a $ 4 billion loan forgiveness program that targeted Black farmers , among others , the Inflation Reduction Act replaces it with a new iteration that offers assistance to a broader group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lawsuit filed by white farmers that argues that the original program is discriminatory , which halted the relief to Black farmers .\nBlack farmers have experienced a \u201c well-documented history of race-based discrimination from the USDA , \u201d said D\u00e3nia Davy , director of land retention and advocacy for the Federation of Southern Cooperatives , an East Point , Georgia-based nonprofit of Black farmers , landowners , and cooperatives .\nBy using \u201c race neutral \u201d language , Congress \u201c kind of walked back from the commitment to racial equity.\n\u201d \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black farmers in the ways that programs were made available to white farmers throughout our nation \u2019 s history , there \u2019 s generally push back , \u201d Davy said .\n\u201c I think that Congress kind of yielded to that.\n\u201d Lawmakers \u2019 unwillingness to target race in the Inflation Reduction Act continues to negate the promise made to Black farmers .\nWhile speaking to the House Committee on Agriculture in March 2021 , Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack acknowledged the mistreatment and discrimination against Black farmers .\nHe noted the federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem , but said more should be done , including creating more equitable opportunities for Black farmers and producers .\nThat same month , the Biden administration passed the American Rescue Plan , which included the $ 4 billion debt forgiveness program for socially disadvantaged farmers .\nAfter a federal judge issued a restraining order to pause the payments , the Department of Agriculture promised to \u201c forcefully defend \u201d the relief owed to Black farmers .\nBut , the assurances made by the Biden Administration never came to fruition .\nUSDA officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment before publication .\nThe Inflation Reduction Act alludes to the additional needs of Black farmers without specifying race .\nIt provides $ 125 million for technical assistance regarding food , agriculture , and agricultural credit to underserved farmers , ranchers , or forest landowners , including those living in high poverty areas .\nAnother program provides $ 2.2 billion for farmers who have experienced discrimination prior to January 2021 by the Department of Agriculture \u2019 s farm lending programs .\nRecipients can receive up to $ 500,000 .\nDavy is concerned Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBecause some were told that their debt had been temporarily suspended while awaiting forgiveness from the original debt relief program , Davy worries they will now be labeled as in default , potentially making them ineligible for the new relief .\nThe Inflation Reduction Act grants nearly $ 38 billion for agricultural conservation , renewable energy , and forestry to help farmers and ranchers tackle the climate crisis .\nMore than $ 18 billion will be allocated toward four existing voluntary conservation and environmental quality-related programs that provide financial and technical assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the programs , administered by the USDA \u2019 s Natural Resources Conservation Service , help improve air quality , soil health , and land for better agricultural production and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions .\nWith this huge investment , it \u2019 s important to \u201c level the playing field \u201d for Black folks , said Gregory Jenkins , professor of Meteorology and Atmospheric Science , Geography , and African Studies at Penn State University .\nIf not addressed , climate change will continue to perpetuate the poverty , unemployment , and food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities , he said .\nIt is unclear how the funds will be dispersed or to whom , Jenkins said .\nMeanwhile , while the full effects of climate change on Black farmers aren \u2019 t easily predicted , Jenkins suspects heavy rains and extreme heat will continue to disproportionately impact their health and well-being .\nMore than 385,000 agriculture-related jobs will come from this legislation , according to an August study by the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst .\nFor Jenkins , this means encouraging young Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farming , including technology and conservation strategies , to help farmers who are already stretched thin .\n\u201c Black farmers will be extremely vulnerable .\nThey can not adapt to what is coming , \u201d said Jenkins .\n\u201c We need to protect the farmers , but we certainly need to deal with the fact that Black farmers do not have the same level of resources or assets to deal with a climate crisis.\n\u201d As Black farmers have struggled to protect their

racial wealth gap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] decision on student debt can not become the latest example of a policy that has left Black people , especially Black women , behind , \u201d NAACP President Derrick Johnson tweeted ahead of the official announcement .\n\u201c This is not how you treat Black voters who turned out in record numbers and provided 90 percent of their vote to once again save democracy in 2020.\n\u201d The student debt crisis is particularly challenging for Black Americans , who borrow more on average than their white peers and often struggle to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an average of $ 55,532 in graduate loans , compared to just $ 27,962 for white borrowers , according to one study from the Education Trust .\nBlack students who pursue a graduate degree often end up earning the same amount as their white co-workers with a lesser degree .\nA college degree has become increasingly costly as more Black Americans have pursued higher education .\nThe average annual cost of college is more than 10 times higher today than it was in the 1980s , according to data from the National Center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual tuition and fees cost an average of $ 1,289 .\nToday , that figure has skyrocketed to more than $ 13,000 .\nDuring that time , college enrollment also has diversified .\nAbout 40 % of young Black adults are enrolled in college today \u2014 more than double the rate of college participation in 1980 .\nEven beyond those systemic inequities , Black students have been disproportionately victimized by predatory for-profit colleges that charged high rates while failing to deliver the lucrative careers they promised .\nBlack students make up 21 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are just 13 % of the student population at public colleges , according to one 2019 study .\nFor Black Americans , student loan debt is \u2014 according to some experts \u2014 the latest in a history of ongoing practices that contribute to the racial wealth gap , intensifying the lingering impacts of sharecropping , subprime mortgages , and predatory for-profit colleges .\n\u201c I think the movement to cancel student loan debt , and to understand how it \u2019 s disproportionately affecting Black borrowers , is a racial justice issue , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor of public policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill .\nPrior to Biden \u2019 s announcement , Addo said she anticipated either another extension on the payment freeze for student loans , or a cancellation of roughly $ 10,000 in federal student loan debt , as Biden pledged on the campaign trail .\n\u201c I

the investment and that it would pay itself off.\n\u201d Though Tatum excelled in journalism , the field didn \u2019 t provide enough to pay off the debt he accrued , which cost him about $ 450 per month .\nHe ultimately made a career switch , becoming a business analyst .\nHe moved back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work toward paying off his debts .\nThe student loan crisis has become a defining issue for young Americans like Tatum , defining the economic struggles of the most educated generation in the nation \u2019 s history .\nIt has sparked an activist movement that advocated for federal action , pressuring the Biden administration to make fundamental changes to college affordability .\n\u201c What we know , time and time again , is that today \u2019 s millennials and Gen Z are not as financially stable as generations before us , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young Invincibles , a national nonprofit that serves to amplify the interests of young voters in politics and public policy .\n\u201c Student debt is one of the contributing factors to that.\n\u201d McGuire points to several noteworthy actions on student debt during Biden \u2019 s term .\nHis administration has instituted regulations on for-profit colleges , which penalized institutions that leave graduating students with obscene amounts of debt .\nIt also created a public service loan forgiveness waiver , which broadened the pool of people who are eligible for debt forgiveness .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ activists are 100 percent responsible for student debt being an issue that is on the front lines of the conversations we \u2019 re having right now , \u201d she said .\n\u201c We also have young people who are more vocal than they \u2019 ve ever been on the issues that impact them.\n\u201d At the same time , McGuire wants to make it clear that student loan debt remains \u201c a multigenerational issue , \u201d particularly for students of color and those who are low income .\n\u201c Student debt creates barriers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c When we send our first-generation college students to school for the first time , the family is accepting that debt .\nAnd we do know that these [ Black ] families borrow more , and have a more difficult time repaying those loans.\n\u201d When Kevon Chisolm first went to college in 1987 , he had about $ 100 in his pocket .\nBy the time he finished his

Jimmy Harris received a text alert : A brewing storm heading toward his New Orleans district had prompted a flood advisory .\nMoments later , the state \u2019 s all-male bond commission voted 7-6 to temporarily block a $ 39 million loan that New Orleans planned to use for a power station to operate drainage pumps that protect against flooding .\nThe commission \u2019 s goal : pressure the city \u2019 s leaders to impose Louisiana \u2019 s strict abortion ban , which the mayor , City Council , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehemently vowed not to enforce .\nThe vote is the latest political strong-arm move in \u201c post-Roe \u201d America .\nThis one poses a dual threat to Black Louisianans , who suffer disproportionately from the devastating consequences of flooding and power outages as well as the health implications of limited access to reproductive health care .\nBlack Louisianans receive abortions at a rate five times higher than white people , according to data from the state \u2019 s Department of Health .\n\u201c It is evident that the rollback of Roe has little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has more to do with control , \u201d said Andrea Boyles , an associate professor of sociology & Africana studies at Tulane University .\n\u201c White men , particularly who are socially , economically , and politically privileged , are making decisions that will ultimately have the greatest impact and will be most devastating for Black women.\n\u201d Harris , who holds a temporary position on the commission and is its only non-white member , said that the loan would help protect nearly 400,000 people \u2014 many of whom were ravaged by hurricanes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects that the storm-battered area faces .\nYet , at the insistence of the state \u2019 s Republican Attorney General Jeff Landry , seven of the commission \u2019 s 13 members leveraged their political power to withhold funding for flood protection from the city , which is expected to be the second-worst hit by floods in the country over the next three decades .\nFollowing the bond commission \u2019 s vote on August 18 , Landry took to Facebook to praise the decision , calling it a \u201c step toward \u201d ensuring all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s abortion ban , which is among the strictest in the country .\nIt outlaws all abortion procedures , including those for victims of rape and incest , unless the pregnant person \u2019 s life is in danger .\nNew Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell , a Black woman , said in a statement that she is \u201c disappointed , but not surprised , by the manufactured crisis of the attorney general , who has once again delayed critical infrastructure funding in the middle of hurricane season.\n\u201d Across the South and Midwest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities over enforcement of abortion bans .\nProsecutors in cities , including Indianapolis and Atlanta , have committed to not chasing abortion providers .\nAfter the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion this summer , New Orleans leaders pledged not to enforce the state \u2019 s ban .\nTara Wicker , the state director of Louisiana Black Advocates For Life , said the city \u2019 s failure to impose the restrictions left state leaders little choice but to leverage their power to enforce the abortion restrictions .\n\u201c I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and respect and honor the voices of Louisiana citizens and do what \u2019 s right and let \u2019 s make sure that all the resources are there \u2014 the flood resources are there , the resources are there for moms to take care of their babies , \u201d she said .\nWicker added : \u201c It \u2019 s a matter of life ; pro-life in its entirety.\n\u201d The inequities in access to health care and protections from environmental disaster \u2014 connected through a history of racist social , economic , and housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders can wield power to disproportionately harm Black Americans .\nBoyles pointed to the long legacy of medical racism in the United States , including the forced sterilization of Black women , as an example of the \u201c catastrophic fallout of white men \u2019 s decisions \u201d about Black Americans \u2019 bodies .\nIn the 1800s , Marion Sims \u2014 once known as the \u201c father of modern gynecology \u201d \u2014 conducted experiments on enslaved women without anesthesia .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a historic undertone , a very racist and classist undertone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to restrict flood funding , Boyles said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a vicious cycle .\nIt \u2019 s become more brazen and more overt and apparent as time goes by.\n\u201d Louisiana \u2019 s state Senate is 76 % white , compared to the total state population , which is 57 % white .\nLess than 15 % of the state \u2019 s senators are women , with only two of the state senators being Black women .\nThe commission , which is predominantly made up of state senators and representatives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved in September , the funding will be made available to update power for pumps that ensure safe drinking water and sewer drainage in New Orleans .\nCity officials hope that the project will be completed by 2024 .\nLast year , as Hurricane Ida wrecked poor Black and Native communities along the Gulf Coast , including New Orleans , more than 600,000 people in Louisiana lost access to clean water for more than a week .\nThe biggest culprit behind the water woes was that water systems could not get the electricity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe city \u2019 s current Sewerage & Water Board facility is more than 100 years old .\nOnly two of five turbines are in working order at the facility responsible for providing drinking water to thousands of homes and pumping out rain during storms .\nThe move by the state \u2019 s bond commission aligns with a history of neglect when New Orleans is in the face of imminent disaster , said Arthur Johnson , chief executive of Sustain the Nine , a nonprofit organization that supports the city \u2019 s predominately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re already concerned .\nWe \u2019 re still impacted by Hurricane Ida and the city always gets on edge around the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina , \u201d said Johnson , whose nonprofit was formed after Hurricane Katrina to revitalize the badly damaged Lower 9th Ward .\n\u201c When political issues are used in an objective to withhold funding that will be beneficial and necessary to protect communities , it should be a crime.\n\u201d It says a lot about race in Louisiana , said Johnson .\n\u201c This is a majority Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen how all the resources we need have been withheld from us.\n\u201d Following the local , state , and federal government \u2019 s failed response to Hurricane Katrina , leaders were accused of \u201c racial discrimination and ethnic cleansing \u201d as an estimated 1,000 Black people lost their lives and 100,000 Black folks in Louisiana were displaced .\nJohnson co-founded Sustain the Nine with the late Pam Dashiell , a New Orleans native and activist on climate , health , and women rights who was one of the most notable voices in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aftermath of Hurricane Katrina .\nBeyond advocating to rebuild the physical infrastructure of the neighborhood , the group focuses on rebuilding community relationships .\nTo Johnson , community \u2014 and teaching residents how to conserve the environment they occupy \u2014 is a climate solution .\nThe emphasis on rebuilding community connections has become hugely important as the region \u2019 s Black communities continue to reel from the especially traumatic 2020 and 2021 storm seasons .\nDiscriminatory practices in disaster recovery programs have stifled recovery attempts in majority-Black areas .\nThe vote to delay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the other , you \u2019 re going to be punished , \u201d said Boyles , the Tulane professor .\n\u201c There seems to be no bottom or no low to how far people are willing to go in order to maintain

Reeves provided a long-awaited response to the crisis on Tuesday , declaring a state of emergency that allowed the state health department and Mississippi Emergency Management Agency to oversee

Jackson has often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and life-threatening challenges for infants and the elderly .\nThe problem has been made worse during severe weather events that are becoming more common in the South

aggressive shutoff and lien policies , which disproportionately impact poor Black residents .\nDuring last year \u2019 s water crisis , Reeves publicly declared that the city should first look @ @ @ @

water failures have been chalked up to general divestment in the city , exacerbated by a shrinking population and tax base .\nWhile much of that exodus was driven by white flight to surrounding

think about Black women , \u201d said Janet Garcia-Hallett , assistant professor of criminal justice at the University of New Haven .\n\u201c When we start speaking about mass shootings or shooting in an airport or things of that nature , we often see that in the media with a white person .\nSo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , we wonder what is going on.\n\u201d Black women were the offenders in 5.8 % of homicides in which race and sex were known , according to the FBI \u2019 s 2019 crime report .\nThat figure rose slightly in 2020 to 7.4 % .\nBy comparison , Black women constitute 6.8 % of the U.S. population .\nIn federal prisons , less than 1 % of Black women are incarcerated for homicide or aggravated assault , compared to nearly 3 % of all incarcerated men , according to federal data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the norm when we look at percentages , \u201d Gracia-Hallett said of Black women \u2019 s involvement in high-profile homicides .\n\u201c It is really a small percentage compared to what women often are incarcerated for or are in the justice system for.\n\u201d Women in the criminal justice system often have a history of trauma that was never addressed , Garcia-Hallett said , contributing to mental health issues that exacerbated over time .\nFollowing the Dallas airport shooting last month , a 37-year-old Black woman was charged with first-degree felony aggravated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously had been found incompetent to stand trial , and her mother told a court that she had been given medication for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder , the Dallas Morning News reported .\nIn the case of another 37-year-old Black woman , who has been charged with six counts of murder for the crash in California , prosecutors said she had been involuntarily committed for psychiatric issues multiple times , according to the Los Angeles Times , and her mental health had been in decline .\nIt \u2019 s unknown if mental health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nA 34-year-old Black woman had filed lawsuits against her employer , co-workers , homeowners association , and neighbors alleging that they conspired to burglarize her home .\nVictims Wesley Freeman , 41 , and Michael Shinners , 60 , are listed among the defendants .\nAbout 69 % of women in state prisons and 52 % of women in federal prisons have a history of mental health problems , according to 2016 data reported by the Bureau of Justice Statistics .\nBy comparison , 41 % of men in state prisons and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have such a history .\nBut some believe the problem among incarcerated women could be even greater .\nA 2008 report by the Prison Policy Initiative estimated that \u201c as many as 80 % of incarcerated women meet the criteria for at least one lifetime psychiatric disorder.\n\u201d Compared to the general population , \u201c incarcerated women have a significantly higher incidence of mental health disorders including schizophrenia , major depression , substance use disorders , psychosexual dysfunction , and antisocial personality disorder.\n\u201d While the BJS report found higher rates of documented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted particularly low rates among Black people .\nJust 33 % of Black people in state prisons and 17 % of those in federal prisons have a history of mental health issues , the report noted , compared to 53 % and 44 % of incarcerated white people , respectively .\nExperts have noted that Black people are often underdiagnosed because of stigmas that make them hesitant to seek help and a lack of mental health resources in their communities .\nSome , they say , don \u2019 t learn they have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c As Black people , we are well aware that society doesn \u2019 t give us the same room for error as it gives other people .\nSo , of course , we want to distance ourselves from things that are stigmatized or behaviors that get people in trouble , \u201d said forensic psychiatrist Dr. Sarah Vinson .\n\u201c Mental illness has been stigmatized \u2026 so there \u2019 s a desire , I think , from the self-preservation standpoint , to disassociate yourself from people who are falling into those categories , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being Black in a racist society against you.\n\u201d During the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic , some people have developed new or more severe mental health symptoms , said Vinson , interim chair of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Morehouse School of Medicine .\nThose stressors , coupled with being Black and a woman in the U.S. , can manifest into an event with \u201c potential negative implications for their mental health and , in turn , their behavior , \u201d she said .\nBecause media images of schizophrenia and other mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , people dealing with crises can be criminalized instead of receiving the psychiatric help they need , Vinson said .\n\u201c If the narrative is that people with schizophrenia are dangerous , then the natural response to people with that diagnosis is for them to be in jail , \u201d said Vinson .\n\u201d If the narrative is that schizophrenia is a chronic illness that is treatable , that people can live in recovery and still have the appropriate responses , then the narrative should be that these people should get help and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in jail.\n\u201d Because of a lack of mental health services in many Black communities , there are limited opportunities to intervene before people with psychiatric issues end up in the criminal justice system .\nFor help , Black families often have turned to religion or publicly funded programs \u2014 which sometimes get cut from local and state budgets \u2014 because of financial barriers that may make it difficult to afford quality care .\n\u201c We should be providing those services in the community to prevent them from getting behind bars in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having an episode , to prevent them from responding a certain way , to prevent them from committing a robbery out of financial difficulties , \u201d said Garcia-Hallett .\n\u201c There should be enough [ resources ] in the community to prevent the engagement and those activities to begin with .\n\u201d", "author": "Christina

pattern of distrust when Black patients seek help with pain , especially Black women .\nBlack patients are significantly less likely to receive adequate pain treatment across a wide range of diagnoses compared to other patients .\nIn the emergency room , Black patients with bone fractures are less likely to receive pain medication .\nAnd among children with appendicitis , Black kids are significantly less likely to be administered painkillers , including opioids .\nAcknowledgement of pain \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backaches \u2014 requires physicians to rely on their judgment more heavily than when there are visible scars and tangible test results .\nThat causes racial disparities to rise .\nPain is a combination of physical sensation , deeply felt emotion , and a traumatic memory , explained Dr. Haider Warraich , an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School .\nIt \u2019 s a universal warning that something \u2019 s wrong , beginning with nerve endings feeling a sensation , then relaying information to the central nervous system and , eventually , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might well be the most complex phenomenon that we ever experience , \u201d Warraich said .\n\u201c Because of its subjective nature , pain is very , very sensitive to some of our deepest prejudices as clinicians .\nIt requires clinicians to be much more open , much more trusting of their

.\nShe has since found community as a part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we talk about racial disparities in pain and pain management , what we \u2019 re really talking about are those disparities in how some

Humanities and Ethic at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston .\nThe disparities intensify for Black women as racial discrimination melds with gender bias .\nHigher wealth , social class , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these women .\nThe racial bias persists .\nBlack women are less likely than white women to be diagnosed with endometriosis when they were experiencing pelvic pain .\nAnd according to a report published this year , more than 70 % of Black women ages 18 to 49 said they \u2019 ve experienced at least one negative interaction with care providers , including dismissal of

.\nThe \u201c strong Black woman \u201d trope , which characterizes Black women as naturally resilient , self-sacrificing , and independent , encourages physicians to view Black women as more willing

according to a 2016 study on false beliefs regarding biological differences between races .\nAnd students who believed Black patients were less sensitive to pain were less likely to treat pain appropriately .\n\u201c Clinicians don \u2019 t trust Black people to narrate their pain , \u201d Ray said .\n\u201c Clinicians don \u2019 t trust Black women to narrate their pain.\n\u201d Doctors

get a second chance at normal lives if Gov .\nGavin Newsom signs an historic bill that seals their criminal convictions from the eyes of potential employers , landlords , and licensing agencies .\nThe legislation , which eliminates certain felony convictions from background checks , could be revolutionary for California \u2019 s Black communities , which have a disproportionate number of previously incarcerated residents , contributing to high rates of unemployment and homelessness .\nNationwide , about 1 in 3 Black men have a felony conviction , affecting their access to jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote and serve on juries .\nThose \u201c collateral consequences \u201d disproportionately affect people of color and low-income folks in ways that can follow them for their entire lives , said Jay Jordan , who spearheaded the push for the landmark legislation .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a huge epidemic right now of formerly incarcerated men dying from cardiac arrest and other health problems \u2014 high stress \u2014 because of this mountain of barriers , \u201d said Jordan , who was incarcerated for robbery 18 years ago .\nToday he is CEO of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides free resources for individuals with past arrests and convictions .\n\u201c We \u2019 re suffering in silence because we did harm in our community , and so we take and take and take all the punishment until the day we die.\n\u201d The legislation , passed by the California Senate in August , would shield certain records for those who have not re-entered the criminal justice system within four years of completing their sentences , parole , or probation .\nThe bill does not automatically seal murder or other high-level felony convictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are mandated to update their location to law enforcement and the national sex offender registry .\nUnder this bill , a background check would still reveal an applicant \u2019 s criminal history to agencies connected to education , government , and law enforcement .\nBut other agencies , such as the housing industry , would be barred from seeing those sealed convictions , though it wouldn \u2019 t prohibit them from asking an applicant about their criminal history upfront .\nThe policy would make California the first state to provide such a sweeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of individuals with felony convictions .\nSome states have enacted versions of \u201c Clean Slate \u201d laws \u2014 including Arizona , Michigan and New York \u2014 but their expungement programs are more limited in scope , focusing on low-level and nonviolent convictions .\nAdvocates for the California bill , SB 731 , say they \u2019 re confident that Newsom will sign it because of his track record on criminal justice reform .\nIn September 2020 , for instance , Newsom signed a bill that allows trained incarcerated firefighters to expunge their criminal records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , SB 731 would take effect in July 2023 .\nBut the bill has faced criticism .\nOpponents say that preventing potential employers and landlords from accessing applicants \u2019 criminal histories is a dangerous move .\nLaw enforcement groups have been particularly vocal , raising concerns that the bill will encourage more repeat offenders .\n\u201c By expanding the relief of penalties for all felonies , we are placing our communities at risk , \u201d the Peace Officers Research Association of California said in a statement , according to The Associated Press .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street , with their record dismissed , they will have less deterrent to commit another crime.\n\u201d Advocates argue that the legislation would reduce recidivism , giving formerly incarcerated people more opportunities to succeed through legal means .\nIngrid Archie , who works with Jordan as organizing director for TimeDone , says her own story is an example of how the current system fuels a cycle of crime .\nAs an adolescent in California \u2019 s foster care system , Archie was taken into custody for skipping school , she says \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would include gun possession , theft , and gang-related charges .\nArchie struggled to find employment and housing in a safe neighborhood because of her felony charges .\nShe fell into debt while also being ineligible for financial government assistance because of her record .\n\u201c I stayed unemployed for a very long time .\nI worked in call centers for years because that was the only job I could get , \u201d said Archie , 41 .\nA year after she disclosed her felony record on an application for a major telecom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said .\n\u201c They decided they didn \u2019 t want to employ those with a felony record anymore , \u201d she said .\nDesperate to provide for her child , she ended up back in jail on theft and drug sale charges .\nArchie compares this system to The Black Codes , laws that limited the freedom of formerly enslaved Black Americans in the decades following the Civil War .\nFor example , she noted that employment is often a requirement of probation \u2014 similar to the work requirement for formerly enslaved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to jail .\n\u201c We face all of these collateral consequences for having a conviction , and it \u2019 s just another way to keep a collective crowd of people from being able to really re-enter into society for the rest of your life , \u201d Archie said .\n\u201c Some of these barriers are lifelong.\n\u201d Jordan had a similar experience .\nWhile serving more than seven years in prison , he dreamed up a plan to start a nonprofit \u201c to teach the kids about the system \u201d through school assemblies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to do the first assembly , the school district said I couldn \u2019 t do it because I have a felony .\nI had to tell 70 parents this wasn \u2019 t going to happen , \u201d said Jordan , adding , \u201c That was the first time I cried.\n\u201d The ghost of Jordan \u2019 s felony conviction continued to haunt him whenever he applied for housing or inquired about obtaining a professional license .\nBackground checks conducted by employers and licensing agencies show every contact an individual has had with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notation of how the cases were resolved .\nThis failure to report the outcomes of charges \u2014 from felonies to traffic infractions \u2014 has caused millions of Californians to lose out on opportunities such as housing , employment , health care and other essentials to be a productive citizen , said Jordan .\nArrests and charges can turn up in background checks even when they don \u2019 t result in a conviction or when a case is dismissed or pardoned by the governor .\nEven more concerning , a wrongful conviction \u2013 which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and women in the state since 1989 , according to the National Registry of Exonerations \u2014 can also remain on the record books .\nTo address this issue , Jordan says he got the attention of lawmakers including then-Assemblyman Rob Bonta , who authored a bill that created a program that ensures the outcome of a case is recorded on an individual \u2019 s record and reported to the state \u2019 s Department of Justice .\nThat bill , AB 1331 , passed in 2019 .\nNow California \u2019 s attorney general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to people who have completed sentences for misdemeanor convictions and to those who were arrested but not convicted of a crime .\nGoing back to Jan. 1 , 1973 , \u201c we reviewed approximately 12.6 million subject records with roughly 55 million case records .\nOf those 55 million case records , about 11 million were granted relief and , of that , 3.8 million records were also provided directly to the courts , \u201d according to the attorney general \u2019 s spokesperson .\nEnsuring that the outcomes of these cases are properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is critical to ensuring that SB 731 is effective , Jordan said .\nIf state records aren \u2019 t updated , people who are eligible to have their record sealed might be overlooked .\n\u201c If you look at other Clean Slate policies that automate the process like in Michigan , there was a very slim group of people that were eligible , because they didn \u2019 t fix the actual system , \u201d Jordan

by a group of white farmers alleging that a federal debt relief program racially discriminated against them has been dismissed .\nFive white farmers sued the U.S. agriculture secretary last year to challenge the constitutionality of a $ 4 billion debt forgiveness program that targeted socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers , including Black farmers .\nThe lawsuit has halted the debt relief

, activists , lawmakers , and political insiders whom you should know .\nVoting apathy is real for America \u2019 s youngest demographic , especially Black adults who have come of age during the Trump

from climate-focused charitable organizations , Banks said , and he plans to redistribute the funds to grassroots climate groups in 13 states before the November election .\nBlack people , who have experienced an outsized share of the climate crisis from hurricanes to water contamination to industrial pollution , are a major target for climate disinformation .\nOil , coal , and utility companies have targeted Black communities , co-opting community leaders and organizations while praising \u201c false solutions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to the report , fossil fuel companies have funded and

refinery , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cleveland , was his company \u2019 s flagship .\nFast forward nearly a century to the early 2000s , the site , now an industrial waste recycling plant , was once again

bring the site up to environmental , health , and safety standards .\nToday , the site is home to a shipping container storage yard and elevated levels of diesel pollution .\nGiven its current

.\nCleveland \u2019 s environmental health impacts are wide-reaching .\nAlthough millions of dollars have been allocated to address lead exposure , children living in Cuyahoga County continue to have

to figure out who it was because the rest of the monarchs around in Europe were either getting their heads cut off or were told to leave .\nThe monarch was smart , through a monarchical lens , in which they realized they had to figure out a way to make themselves more current and more modern .\nYou see Queen Elizabeth over time trying to do these types of engagements in the commonwealth to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with and to support the British crown because the monarchy \u2019 s only purpose is to uphold old ways .\nThis nostalgia of the past attached to the British nation-state is being cracked , because that story was always false .\nWe \u2019 re seeing people having to face the reality of what they were told who their queen was , what they were told their nation state was , or what they were told are the basic foundations of who they are .\nIt was showing that around the world , people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut there was never any space .\nSo they made the space and by making the space , the shock to me is that people are gon na have to take a step back and ask themselves , \u201c Is everything I was told about being English , or British , or a part of the British crown [ true ] .\nIf that was all false , what else is false ?\nWho am I and what am I loyal to ?\n\u201d Can you explain how and why somebody , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another country in 2022 ?\nThe minute the Europeans came off that shore and started to colonize the world \u2014 it \u2019 s not just the British , you got the Spanish , the French , the Portuguese , the Dutch \u2014 that created another kind of global economy that was heavily tied to oppressive , now capitalistic systems .\nSo you still see that in the present day .\nWhen you have countries , especially in the Caribbean , who most of the time colonization took resources from resource-rich areas , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it means to be a colonialist or an imperialist .\nYou don \u2019 t know how to feed people ; you just know how to take from them .\nNow you

really .\nMany times I \u2019 ve seen a lot of older folks in the diaspora who really love the queen .\nWell , you have to ask yourself who taught them how to love that queen ?\nMalcolm [ X ] says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hate yourself ?\n\u201d And he was spot on because if you look at the education systems , a lot of former colonies were usually either run by English-speaking entities or the church .\nSo you are being taught from the beginning that you need somebody else \u2014 whether it be white Jesus up top , or white colonizers over in Europe to help you manage your own affairs .\nOver time , you get folks realizing , quite frankly , this is some bullshit .\nWhen you ask for freedom and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my shit back , \u201d there will be repercussions .\nSo I think it \u2019 s actually smart to do it in a multifaceted way to have numbers of countries saying , \u201c No , we \u2019 re going to pull out now , \u201d because there is strength in numbers when you have been the head of

rid of these majestic titles and move forward ?\nI would say , a cautionary , yes .\nThis is why I \u2019 m really excited and happy that there is more understanding of different histories coming into the conversation , because we have to learn from what people did in the past .\nWhat we learned a lot of times , depending upon the country , is that you can \u2019 t just replace one king with another .\nYou can \u2019 t just replace one oppressor with another , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems that operate in the country will dictate whether that country will actually be more free , or will it just reproduce to another colonial mechanism ?\nI think there \u2019 s gon na be a lot of Black folks around the world and countries asking themselves what it is they \u2019 re actually trying to do ?\nWhat is it they \u2019 re actually trying to do that \u2019 s sustainable for the population ?\nAnd I think that this is a time where we have to understand that our struggles are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these struggles are tied together .\nI know that they \u2019 re talking about creating a Latin American conglomerate like the EU .\nI think we \u2019 re gon na start to see a rise of those types of engagements .\nThere \u2019 s been talk about different African countries coming together for a kind of conglomerate .\nI think we \u2019 re going to start seeing the countries doing more collaborating like the EU did .\nDo you think that this may be the moment that Black folks get together and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we come together , we end up with a Black Wall Street [ massacre ] or the [ 1985 MOVE ] bombing in Philadelphia .\nCan this moment finally happen where we can come together around the world and show our strength in numbers ?\nAnd do you think we will see change during our lifetime ?\nI really do think it \u2019 s a possibility , and that \u2019 s where I do get excited .\nWe \u2019 ve also seen a resurgence of a lot of Black folks around the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practices , community practices \u2014 because it \u2019 s a way for us to tap back into what community means outside of a white capitalistic patriarchal framework .\nI don \u2019 t necessarily think

Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in November created hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long-awaited fix for the nation \u2019 s crumbling pipes , bridges , and roads .\nBut government funding often has bypassed smaller and rural communities , said Pablo Ortiz , climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists .\nBecause only a small number of families are affected in these communities , they are deemed \u201c too expensive \u201d and don \u2019 t create \u201c a necessary pressure for the government to help , \u201d he said .\nLike Jackson , these areas suffer from poor air quality , lower tax bases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are hard hit by climate change , which exacerbates the water issues , Ortiz explained .\nThe neglect has forced the communities to create piecemeal solutions in rural and impoverished regions of California \u2019 s Central Valley .\nJust a few hundred miles away in Orange County , one of the wealthiest and whitest regions in the state , water systems recently received $ 310 million in upgrades to combat the state \u2019 s drought .\nThe advancements will allow the county to satisfy 75 % of its drinking water needs by combining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s groundwater .\nRead more : Residents : Mississippi Water Crisis Is \u2018 Racism to the Umpteenth Degree.\n\u2019 Ortiz wanted to focus on community-based solutions in the Central Valley , which has struggled with water contamination , excessive drought , and waning surface water availability for years .\nWhile working with grassroots organizations , Ortiz found grant funding to launch a pilot project installing free water infiltration systems in impacted homes .\nThe first filter was installed in Mendota , California , a rural community that is 96 % Hispanic .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ woes , community organizers and government officials must work in tandem , Ortiz said .\nFor example , the major issue of aquifer pollution from agriculture in rural places throughout California , the Midwest , and along the Mississippi River has not received much attention in the latest round of federal funding .\nOn top of that , air pollution and contaminated water from fertilizer and pesticides still exist , he said .\nAnd even with infrastructure improvements , severe weather , climate change , and pollution will continue to exacerbate water issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t do enough to target the source of the air pollution and contaminated water , he said .\n\u201c There are millions of dollars going to solve this problem , which is great , but it lacks [ a ] long-term solution , \u201d Ortiz said .\n\u201c Most of these policies or regulations are not looking at the source of the problem.\n\u201d Some communities of color are already enacting solutions that could help close the water gap , experts say .\nIn Milwaukee , Chicago , New York City , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhoods are using natural infrastructure to improve water quality and water-use efficiency through green roofs and \u201c rain gardens , \u201d which capture rainwater and water runoff .\nThese systems help naturally and immediately replenish the groundwater supply and take pressure off outdated sewage and water treatment infrastructure .\nThese solutions also save communities millions of dollars in the long run .\nA recent EPA study found that every $ 1 spent on natural water infrastructure saved $ 27 in future contamination cleanup costs .\nGloria Gray , the first Black chairwoman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the largest water district in the country , says centering community voices in combating the country \u2019 s water issues is \u201c absolutely essential.\n\u201d \u201c There has to be people at the table that have had the lived experiences or some knowledge when we discuss any kind of decision that we \u2019 re going to make , whether it \u2019 s water conservation or infrastructure , \u201d she said .\nHowever , Gray \u2019 s district has shown that having a seat at the table only goes so far when money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this month , as students at Jordan High School in the historic Black district of Watts in Los Angeles experienced water contamination and shut-offs during the region \u2019 s longest-ever heatwave , celebrities in Los Angeles such as Kim Kardashian and Kevin Hart were using millions of gallons of water in a single month .\nTurner Keller has seen this kind of betrayal regularly in spite of the rise of community water activism , but she would rather continue fighting .\nIt is about bringing resources to Black folks across the country and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health crises in Black neighborhoods .\n\u201c They \u2019 re saying , \u2018 Oh , well , [ the water in Jackson ] is going to be back to normal.\n\u2019 But it \u2019 s not normal for you to turn your water on and there is none .\nIt \u2019 s not normal for you to pay your water bill , and you \u2019 re still being charged , but you have no service .\nOr if the water does come out of the faucet , it \u2019 s so brown that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d she said .\n\u201c I can \u2019 t afford to be quiet because I was always told that silence proves content , \u201d she added .\n\u201c The only thing that brings about

Board of Education", "content": "When the U.S. Supreme Court deemed segregated schooling unconstitutional in 1954 , the landmark decision become a symbol of racial progress .\nBut the ruling came with a hidden cost : the dismissal of tens of thousands of Black teachers and principals as white school staff poured into previously all-Black schools and were promoted into leadership roles over their Black colleagues .\nThe fallout from the loss of a generation of Black educators continues today .\nFewer than 1 in 10 teachers in U.S. public schools are Black , according to the Pew Research Center .\nAnd while the share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marginalized backgrounds has increased in recent decades , their proportion isn \u2019 t keeping up with the nation \u2019 s rapidly diversifying population of school-aged children .\nIn the recently published book , Jim Crow \u2019 s Pink Slip : The Untold Story of Black Principal and Teacher Leadership , Leslie T. Fenwick details how the Supreme Court decision affected Black educators and what the ramifications are today .\nFenwick , an education professor at Howard University who served as dean of the department for over a decade , spoke to Capital B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how it can help people understand the policy issues that persist in education .\nThe conversation was lightly edited for clarity and length .\nCapital B : Let \u2019 s start at the beginning .\nWhere did the inspiration for writing this book come from ?\nLeslie T. Fenwick : The inspiration for that came from my own family history : My parents and my grandparents , on both sides of my family , attended racially segregated schools , all-Black schools .\nAnd , as I was growing up , my parents would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their credentials .\nGrowing up , my understanding about the caliber of teachers in all-Black schools ran counter to the narrative that we hear about Brown [ v. Board of Education ] .\nMy parents , and their friends , did not support segregation and segregation policies .\nThey did , however , hold great pride in the teachers who taught them in the schools that they attended .\nWhen people look at Brown v. Board of Education , they see it as this national success that we as a country were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what your book does pokes at that idea .\nIt shows what we actually lost as a result of the integration that took place in schools .\nHow have people generally received this when they either read your book or you tell them what the premise is ?\nThe response has been really interesting .\nIt falls into two categories : All audiences have said , \u201c Wow , I didn \u2019 t know that , \u201d and they \u2019 re really shocked that they didn \u2019 t know that .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black individuals , have said , \u201c Wow , that \u2019 s my family history.\n\u201d But mainly , the response is , \u201c How could I not have known that ?\n\u201d So when you say Brown v. Board of Education was a miraculous legal decision , there \u2019 s no doubt about that .\nIt ended legally enforced racial segregation in public schools , and even American society more broadly .\nAnd I believe the decision was an intellectual and moral accomplishment by these NAACP lawyers , prime among them Thurgood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we never implemented Brown the way it was intended to be implemented .\nBrown never meant close all the Black schools and fire all the Black educators , principals , and teachers , and then take the Black students and put them in previously segregated all-white schools .\nIt never said that , but that was what was orchestrated to happen .\nI make it really clear when I speak , the [ Supreme Court ] decision should be held harmless .\nThe decision was miraculous .\nIt was an intellectual and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decision \u2014 massive resistance \u2014 is what caused us to misimplement , if that \u2019 s a word , the decision .\nI want to take a moment to discuss the impact that the purging of black educators after Brown v. Board has had on black students .\nDiversity and representation within classrooms is still something that a lot of school systems struggle with today .\nHow do you think this exodus of Black educators affected Black students over the last several decades ?\nWe live in a democracy .\nWe live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a representative democracy , a pluralistic democracy , and yet , the models of intellectual authority and leadership authority in schools are almost exclusively white .\nAnd so , the workforce does not reflect the student population , which is now majority students of color .\nAnd , in fact , also a majority of students come from families experiencing poverty .\nSo students are missing out on several things : They \u2019 re missing out on the model of intellectual authority , the model of leadership authority , in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they \u2019 re exposed to is almost exclusively white in imagery , in content , and authorship .\nAnd we know from at least 30 to 40 years of research , that there are benefits that accrue academic and social benefits to Black , Hispanic , and Latinx students , especially when they \u2019 re in schools that are diversely staffed .\nThose students are less likely to be suspended or expelled .\nThey \u2019 re less likely to be misplaced in special ed .\nThey \u2019 re more likely to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re more likely to graduate high school in four years .\nAnd they \u2019 re more likely to apply for and be accepted to and matriculate in college .\nSo when you ask , \u201c What are they missing out on ?\n\u201d \u2014 they \u2019 re missing out on a lot .\nWhat I think is also really interesting about your book is that it is centered in the past , with Brown v. Board .\nHow do you think it fits into the narrative of all of these conversations that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in schools ?\nOne of the central thesis of my book is that this history is not good .\nWe \u2019 re continuing to live with this history .\nIt \u2019 s part of a continuum .\nSo when Black educators were purged from the system , we lost the nation \u2019 s most credentialed educators .\nAnd I kind of chronicle how that occurred , and what it meant .\nThe end of the book is a series of policy recommendations to reverse the trend of this history .\nAnd part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never acknowledged this history .\nWe \u2019 ve never acknowledged the truth about why we have lots of conversations , as you well know , about educator workforce diversity .\nAnd the myth is kind of sad \u2014 I always say it in a poetry voice : \u2018 With Brown , Blacks pursued other professions unavailable to them prior to desegregation.\n\u2019 And that \u2019 s a lie .\nIt \u2019 s an outright lie .\nThis historical record doesn \u2019 t support that .\nThe truth is that white resistance to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown , nearly decimated the black educator pipeline , and here , I \u2019 m talking almost exclusively about teachers and principals , and we \u2019 re living with the fallout of that history .\nWe haven \u2019 t escaped it yet .", "author": "Giulia Heyward", "url":

73 % of Black voters said that their lives haven \u2019 t improved since Biden became president , according to the NAACP and HIT Strategies research .\nAlmost 30 % of younger Black voters said their

people of the importance .\n\u201c So many young people didn \u2019 t really care about voting , and that \u2019 s what made me want to influence them to at least register or learn about it , \u201d Bolton said while driving through the predominantly Black town of nearly 5,500 .\n\u201c You oughta see them young people \u2026 \u2018 That stuff ain \u2019 t going to benefit me , \u2019 \u201d he

Black Georgians have participated and the participation rates , tracking along with other states in the South , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and these laws have made it more difficult for people to cast ballots , \u201d Slaughter said .\n\u201c In 2021 and even in 2018 , when Stacey Abrams was up against Brian Kemp for governor , we did see increased participation , but it just isn \u2019 t enough given how

down the ballot , another battle is brewing .\nIn school board elections , contentious matters of race and identity have become defining issues in many local campaigns .\nConservative groups have been funneling money into school board races and backing candidates who support \u201c parental rights \u201d in instituting book bans , restricting curriculum , and limiting classroom discussions about systemic racism and gender identity .\nThe growing influence of these groups , such as Moms for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school board candidates who now are pushing back .\nThe ideological war over public education has made school board races particularly contentious .\nIn San Diego , both conservative and union-backed candidates are raking up six-figures in donations as all five school board seats are up for grabs .\nIn Boise , Idaho , an 18-year-old climate activist won his race against an incumbent last month by taking a stance against book bans , which have targeted literature related to race , gender , and sexuality .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve all in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing up at the ballot box and not even thinking about school board races , \u201d said Verjeana McCotter-Jacobs , deputy executive director of the National School Boards Association , which represents 90,000 school board members across the nation .\n\u201c I think what we \u2019 re seeing is people started waking up \u2026 and recognizing that school boards have an enormous amount of authority and power , quite frankly , in the policies.\n\u201d Nationally , school boards are less diverse than the public school students they serve .\nA 2018 survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of respondents were white and 10 % percent were Black .\nMeanwhile , less than half of public school students are white , and 15 % are Black .\nThe disparity could be fueled in part by who is casting ballots .\nA 2020 study found that the majority of voters in school board races are affluent and white , even when the school district serves more students of color .\nThe inclusion of just one school board member of color has been shown to increase a district \u2019 s investment in Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report from Education Week .\nWhile local school board races happen throughout the year , it \u2019 s common to see many clustered around a midterm or presidential election , McCotter-Jacobs said .\nAnd while school board races have been contentious in

largest district in the state .\nThe former high school special education teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lack of respect that I not only felt from our elected officials in the [ North Carolina ] General

that cites the North Carolina state standards for teaching history .\nHe believes that schools should trust that teachers are capable of teaching the nation \u2019 s history , without restrictions from state lawmakers on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexuality .\nAs in many states , North Carolina politicians have debated how issues of race are discussed in classrooms .\nLast year , the state \u2019 s Republican-led legislature passed a bill banning the teaching of critical race theory in classrooms across the state , but Democratic Gov .\nRoy Cooper swiftly vetoed it .\nStill , several school districts have instituted local bans on critical race theory , an advanced study of systemic racism that has been misappropriated to criticize classroom discussions of race .\n\u201c Over the past two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacks on educators and classroom professionals being accused of things that do not take place in the classroom , \u201d Swanson said .\n\u201c As a former teacher , I felt that it was my duty and responsibility to lend my voice in support of my colleagues across the district.\n\u201d Swanson said his support of educators has been met by pushback , including those who say that he is promoting critical race theory .\n\u201c And so I raised the question , where is the critical race theory ?\nI want you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instruction [ website ] and provide me with an example of the critical race theory that you believe is in schools , \u201d he said .\n\u201c And oftentimes , those folks can \u2019 t find it.\n\u201d Swanson , who now works for a local nonprofit , knows he \u2019 s facing a particular challenge against the incumbent , Michele Morrow , who reportedly participated in the Jan. 6 insurrection , according to local news reports .\n\u201c Oftentimes , we see that folks are making policy decisions regarding the profession without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seat at the table , \u201d Swanson said .\n\u201c I decided to throw my hat in because I felt that this district needed a true champion and a true advocate that will center the needs of all of our students , teachers , and families at the board table , making decisions for what \u2019 s best for all of our students.\n\u201d Some school districts have already started making efforts to ease conversations about race and identity in classrooms .\nLast year , the California education department created a

Nigerian immigrant , garnered 16 % of the vote in a City Council district where 82 % of residents are non-white .\nFor him , the racist comments in the audio recording were not surprising .\n\u201c I really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I grew up here .\nI \u2019 m from the hood .\nI know what that racial animosity looks like , \u201d Odega said .\n\u201c The first Spanish words I heard and learned were derogatory terms for Black folks.\n\u201d On Tuesday , President Joe Biden became the latest official to call for the immediate resignation of the three council members .\nMartinez had stepped down from her position as council president and had taken a leave of absence from the council prior to her resignation .\nCedillo and de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but have not tendered a resignation .\nWhile anti-Blackness has permeated Latino communities for generations , in Los Angeles it has been exacerbated by racial tensions born out of rapidly changing neighborhoods .\nSince 1970 , South Los Angeles , which was once 80 % Black and home to upwards of 75 % of all the Black folks in Los Angeles , has become more than two-thirds Latino .\nThe shift , driven by racist housing and policing policies , exacerbated the city \u2019 s homelessness problem .\nAs Latinos immigrated to Los @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , South LA was the most affordable area .\nSince 1980 , the Latino homeownership rate in Los Angeles has risen by 77 % as Black homeownership declined by 15 % .\nA 2016 report by researchers at the University of Southern California found that \u201c newly arrived Latinos \u201d perspectives on Black people are \u201c heavily influenced by anti-black stereotypes , \u201d leading to a \u201c maintained distance from their African-American neighbors.\n\u201d The report outlined that Latino residents tend to hold negative beliefs about Black Angelenos because of the city \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and excessive policing concentrated in Black communities .\nBlack and Latino people in Los Angeles often experience the same elements of economic divestment , environmental pollution , and lack of access to health care .\nBut the recorded conversation highlights the \u201c intoxicating \u201d ways that white supremacy divides America \u2019 s growing communities of color , said Marne Campbell , an African American studies professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles .\n\u201c White supremacy is always around , and anyone in this country can buy into it for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Campbell , the author of Making Black Los Angeles .\n\u201c But we \u2019 ve never been in a political arena like we are in now , where racism comes out as overtly as it has .\nPeople of color are more aggressive about making sure that they hold on to the block that they have , which is often a small part of the structure.\n\u201d Advocates have called for direct civic engagement in the redistricting process to bypass partisan and racially motivated tendencies .\nIn Los Angeles specifically , this includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council from its current 15 .\nThe city \u2019 s population has grown from 1 million to 4 million since the last time local political representation was increased in 1925 .\nCurrently , Los Angeles council members represent 265,000 people on average , the largest amount in the country .\nThe expansion is expected to be included on the city \u2019 s 2024 ballot .\nAcross the country , the leaked conversation has emphasized the deeply entrenched ways that anti-Blackness presents itself in politics , Odega says , but the city \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomena much earlier .\n\u201c These are the same people that just voted to criminalize homelessness that disproportionately impacts displaced Black folks , \u201d explained Odega .\n\u201c While they \u2019 re claiming Black people are overrepresented in the city \u2019 s positions of power , in reality we \u2019 re overrepresented in extreme poverty , the prison system , and homelessness.\n\u201d \u201c It is only since 2020 \u2014 since we used our voices to push for change \u2014 that people noticed our power and feel like we have too much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recoil from the country \u2019 s recent strong Black political movement is to be expected , Campbell says , even from other marginalized groups .\nIt has been amplified by feelings of scarcity brought about by inflation and economic insecurity since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic .\n\u201c Coalition building in this country ebbs and flows , and I think we see [ anti-Blackness ] more when the economy is worse off than when it is really good , \u201d she explained .\n\u201c We \u2019 re convinced that resources are really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it really difficult when people of color have to compete for not just resources , but the proper amount of political representation .\n\u201d", "author": "Adam Mahoney", "url": "https://capitalbnews.org/los-angeles-city-council-redistricting/", "published": "Wed, 12 Oct 2022

Angeles Mid-City Neighborhood Council representative , approached the microphone .\nUnder his breath , he lamented about missing the beginning of his golf game to attend this meeting , a gathering of California \u2019 s reparations task force for descendants of American slavery .\nThe task force is the first of its kind , enshrined by Gov .\nGavin Newsom in 2020 to propose potential reparations for Black families harmed by \u201c debilitating economic , educational , and health hardships.\n\u201d An interim report this summer listed dozens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health care , reducing the scope of law enforcement , raising the minimum wage , and cleaning up environmental pollution , among others .\nBut it \u2019 s the possibility of cash reparations that has created the most tension .\n\u201c I want to say that I have concerns , \u201d Hall , a Black combat veteran , said during the Sept. 23 meeting .\n\u201c I \u2019 m afraid that if you give checks to folks , the average person is going to go to the liquor store , they \u2019 re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we \u2019 re going to lose equity in our neighborhoods.\n\u201d The room was full of mostly Black Angelenos , some rocking African print clothing and shirts adorned with the faces of Rosa Parks and other Black civil rights leaders .\nThey responded to Hall \u2019 s comment with dead stares and an avalanche of ridicule and vigorous debate .\nAttendees bumped heads on who among their neighbors is worthy of redemption and support , exposing deep-seated self-judgments that have seeped through Black communities .\n\u201c Black folks have a right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director of the California Black Power Network , said about the growing tensions during the debate .\n\u201c What we should not do , however , is try to decide who is worthy and who is not .\nReparations are meant to be a unifying force.\n\u201d The nine-member task force made a two-day stop in Los Angeles last month to invite public comment on a potential pathway for reparations .\nThe panel \u2014 consisting of elected officials , doctors , lawyers , and activists \u2014 has eight Black members and one Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliver specific policy recommendations to the governor \u2019 s office and state legislature next summer .\nBut public comments at the Los Angeles meeting highlighted a growing tension among advocates and opponents of reparations for Black Americans : Would a cash infusion alone reverse centuries of targeted violence against Black neighborhoods ?\nHow can Black folks address the ways that racism has created internal divisions among the Black community ?\nThe state \u2019 s exploration of reparations could set a national precedent as discussions about repairing the damage of slavery and systemic discrimination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee advanced legislation that would create a national commission to study reparations , similar to California \u2019 s task force \u2014 but that bill has stagnated .\nThe California Department of Justice said creation of the state \u2019 s task force acknowledges how state and local governments have profited from practices that brutalize Black Americans and \u201c exclude them from meaningful participation in society.\n\u201d In the Los Angeles metropolitan area , the more than 720,000 Black residents have battled decades of housing discrimination , mass incarceration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugs .\nDuring the crack cocaine epidemic in the 1980s and \u2019 90s , Black Californians were incarcerated at a rate five times higher than their share of the population .\nDecades later , the fallout of the epidemic is still palpable .\n\u201c You don \u2019 t have to give no money to no crackhead , \u201d said Zachariah McGee , who said he supports cash reparations in other instances .\n\u201c Why would you do that ?\n\u201d Shortly after McGee , Mylandro Jones , a single father and undergraduate student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angeles , approached the microphone .\n\u201c I want to speak on the people talking about crackheads shouldn \u2019 t get any money , \u201d he said .\n\u201c My stepmom was a crackhead ; she was still a Black woman .\nShe deserves money just like anybody else does .\nShe \u2019 s still a human being.\n\u201d Jones went on to explain how the vestige of slavery has impacted his life , from the flooding of drugs in his community to being regularly targeted by police and spending time shuffling between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation , anchored by a notoriously high cost of living and decades of discriminatory housing policies , is one of the state \u2019 s most distinct markers for racism .\nA recent Capital B News analysis found that California \u2019 s Black residents experience homelessness at a rate 14 times higher than white , Latino , and Asian residents combined .\nFor Woodson , the bigger concern is that direct cash payments alone would cause more money to trickle to white business and landowners .\n\u201c How do we make sure that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just get transferred to the very people who have profited from oppressing and enslaving us ?\n\u201d he said .\n\u201c We need to figure out a way to get cash payments , while also funding programs and services.\n\u201d Task force member Steven Bradford , a Democratic state senator representing South Los Angeles , asked the audience not to allow the debate around reparations to cause more division within the state \u2019 s already splintered and segregated Black community .\n\u201c We need to stay unified ; we need to be together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aren \u2019 t always going to agree , but we have to put forth a unified front.\n\u201d For decades , academic researchers have studied how slavery has negatively impacted Black Americans \u2019 self-view .\nOne of the most widely accepted theories , Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome , outlines how slavery left Black Americans with a distorted self-perception , allowing racist institutions to escape accountability by describing racial inequality as Black folks causing their own \u201c self-destruction.\n\u201d Taiwo Kujichagulia-Seitu , an Oakland-based historian and artist , said reparative acts should address this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payments to Black communities , but also diminishing the effects of European beauty standards and the emphasis on the Western way of living .\n\u201c The root word of reparations is repair , \u201d she said .\n\u201c For any reparations plan to be feasible , it must repair the harm done to people of African descent across every area of society.\n\u201d An estimated 80 % of the state \u2019 s 2.6 million Black residents would be eligible for reparations , according to the task force outlines .\nEligible people are described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chattel enslaved person or the descendant of a free Black person living in the U.S. prior to the end of the 19th century.\n\u201d Earlier this year , the task force confirmed that Black Americans descended from those who immigrated after 1900 will not be eligible for reparations .\nHow Black folks will be expected to prove their lineage has not been determined .\nAt the meeting , the panel outlined specific government wrongdoings that necessitated financial reparations for Black Californians , including the state \u2019 s disproportionate use of eminent domain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Black communities ; medical racism ; and the defunding of schools in Black neighborhoods .\nHowever , the task force said it would be nearly impossible to correctly calculate specific amounts of monetary compensation for many of these factors .\nState economic consultants have argued that Black Californians can be compensated based on the health impacts of racism .\nIn California , Black people have the highest death rates from cancer due to environmental racism , food insecurity , and health care discrimination .\nThis , coupled with the many other causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaves Black folks expected to live roughly eight years less than white Californians .\nThe consultants concluded that the gap in life expectancy for Black Californians is worth upward of $ 125,000 per year , or nearly $ 1 million .\nBradford urged the audience at the meeting to tailor their expectations about the likelihood of the state passing reparations .\n\u201c For a state that didn \u2019 t have slavery , don \u2019 t think they \u2019 re going to be quick to vote on this final product of this task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment is expressed by Kujichagulia-Seitu , who argues that task forces like California \u2019 s have historically been used to stifle political movements by delaying any ability for swift and meaningful change .\nTask forces can deliberate for years without providing any tangible results , which allows political energy to dwindle .\n\u201c Putting a task force together implies that there is not already a body of knowledge in existence , \u201d she said

inclusive to all , not just a select group of Iowans .\nShe covered a wide range of topics , including rural revitalization , mass incarceration , and why the \u201c state has to compete with the streets \u201d in providing economic opportunities for young people .\nA few key takeaways from the conversation : Education : If elected , DeJear would work to increase the number of child care providers in the state , extend the hours of early childhood education , and increase funding to public schools to improve reading scores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maternal health : Improving maternal health is a personal issue for DeJear , and she \u2019 s particularly concerned about the lack of access in rural areas .\nShe wants to employ more health care professionals and make health care more affordable

building is key to achieving common goals .\nYou can watch DeJear \u2019 s entire interview here .\nBelow is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edited for clarity .\nCapital B : Iowa Gov .\nKim Reynolds supports private school voucher programs , while you support increasing more funding for public schools .\nGiven the limited amount of funding for public schools , what do you see as the most critical financial need

want to increase access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positively impact those third-grade reading scores .\nWe lost nearly 40 % of our child care providers in this state over the last two years .\nAgain , negatively impacting communities of color and the working poor and not-working people in this day .\nI want to have at least 30 hours of early childhood education .\nAnd again , not only will that give them an

happening in our state is , while the current governor wants to restrict access to abortion , she and this crusade is not only limiting access to abortion , it \u2019 s limiting access to routine reproductive health care in our state and is disproportionately impacting rural Iowans .\nWe \u2019 ve got 99 counties , and in more than 80 of our counties , mamas can not go to an OB-GYN in their county .\nThat is a problem .\nI spoke with a Black mother probably about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in February .\nShe was five months pregnant at that time and had yet gotten in to see an OB-GYN .\nThat is

nurses , we need more doctors , we need more practitioners .\nAll of these people who can help this system work .\nCurrently , the Republican Party controls the state \u2019 s House and Senate , and

era .\nIn Alabama , Louisiana , Oregon , Tennessee , and Vermont , voters will decide next month whether to close the \u201c slavery loophole \u201d in their state constitutions .\nWhile the U.S. Constitution \u2019 s 13th Amendment is widely credited with ending slavery in 1865 , the wording outlawed the practice \u201c except as a punishment for crime.\n\u201d Rhode Island is the only state that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution , and 19 states still have the slavery loophole on their books .\nThe loophole enabled the Black Codes and Jim Crow Laws , which strictly regulated Black Americans

of slavery in our constitution.\n\u201d In a 2021 poll , Worth Rises found that nearly 70 % of Americans did not know that there is an exception clause in the 13th Amendment .\nAmong the Black respondents , more than 58 % were not aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , and nearly 25 % said they didn \u2019 t know if they supported or opposed the exception .\nRead more : The Push to Expand Voting Access for Incarcerated People Awareness of the slavery loophole grew following the murder of George Floyd in May 2020 , which prompted many white Americans to see in real time how Black people are systemically treated by law enforcement .\nThat year , social justice uprisings prompted Confederate monuments to be toppled , schools named after Civil War leaders to be renamed , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holiday to reignite .\nVoters in Nebraska and Utah also moved to eliminate the slavery loophole from their constitutions that year .\nFederal lawmakers introduced the Abolition Amendment , which calls to ban slavery as a criminal punishment in the U.S. Constitution \u2019 s 13th Amendment .\nThe federal bill has gained support from 175 Democrats and 10 Republicans .\nTylek , who has been lobbying for the legislation , said that educating voters and lawmakers that the exception clause exists and is active in jails and prisons nationwide is a major part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistant counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund , said limited awareness of the loophole is an example of the hurdles that activists have encountered in trying to right the wrongs of slavery and

legacy on our current mass incarceration practices.\n\u201d In states that eliminate their slavery loophole , there \u2019 s rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , after Nebraska changed its constitution , at least one jail in Lancaster County that did not pay incarcerated people for work started enforcing a salary of up to $ 30 a week , the Lincoln Journal Star reported .\nIn more cases , advocates are taking states to court in hopes of convincing a judge that the labor practices are unconstitutional under the new amendment .\nThat can be a challenge when incarcerated people have limited ability to

the vote sparked little change until COVID-19 seeped into the walls of correctional facilities , said Valerie Collins , an attorney for the Colorado-based nonprofit law firm Towards Justice

of Corrections forced labor and threatened disciplinary actions against those who declined to work .\nRead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Convictions for Many Californians Andrew Mark Lamar , an incarcerated person who filed one of those lawsuits , argued that the state \u2019 s inmate work program illegally required him to work in food service under the threat of solitary confinement or losing visitation privileges .\nA state court of appeals judge ruled against Lamar , saying the amendment didn \u2019 t view the prison labor program as involuntary servitude because the program provides skills that

have an immediate effect on the incarceration system , eliminating slavery loopholes galvanizes support and raises awareness about what goes on inside correctional facilities , Ingram said .\n\u201c

because I was considered something beneath a regular human being without the rights of a regular human being , \u201d said Davis , who was released in 2016 and wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Apartheid in America .\n\u201c Human beings are suffering in the United States of America .\nWe \u2019 re losing the moral high ground , and slavery is still real.\n\u201d Next month , Louisiana \u2019 s voters

radio show addresses the intersections of racial justice and hip-hop , are forced to face the fallout of owning one of the most recognizable racist phrases in contemporary culture .\nThe phrase first picked up steam after the birth of the Black Lives Matter movement against police brutality and anti-Black racism in the mid-2010s .\nAccording to the Southern Poverty Law Center , the phrase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full-fledged hate group in the past few years .\nThe group describes itself as \u201c dedicated to the promotion of the white race \u201d and condemns the \u201c laws and immoral orders \u201d that are \u201c targeting everything the white way of life holds dear.\n\u201d The radio hosts are no strangers to addressing racism head on : Their show was created after Ja left a popular Phoenix station after being told by executives that his show was \u201c too Black.\n\u201d Capital B News caught up with Ja to learn about Civic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pair by the phrase \u201c White Lives Matter , \u201d and what they plan to do with the trademark going forward .\nCapital B : Civic Cipher didn \u2019 t register the trademark , so how did you and your co-host come into ownership of it ?\nRamses Ja : Our radio show was born out of the protests of 2020 .\nWe were both DJs and hip-hop radio broadcasters based in Phoenix .\nArizona , so we got the idea to create a political , social justice type of show that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSo we have a listener who decided they wanted to own the right to create , produce , and sell shirts that say \u201c White Lives Matter.\n\u201d This individual didn \u2019 t want to produce those shirts , but rather it \u2019 s my understanding that they were doing it to ensure that the right people benefited from it .\nThis person procured it but didn \u2019 t really love owning it , so they approached us to ensure that the right people benefit from it and that people aren \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were in a much more public position to use it to the advantage of Black folks .\nIt \u2019 s a racist , white supremacist phrase used in our society to hurt Black folks .\nWhat does that feel like to have legal ownership of the phrase ?\nHow have you been able to sit with that heaviness ?\nWhere \u200b\u200bwe land on it is that somebody will own that trademark because it has fully entered into our popular vernacular .\nSo someone will own the right to produce and sell clothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would rather live in a world where the profits from those sales go back to help offset the pain it causes rather than live in a world where I have nothing to do with that .\nI recognize that one of two things could happen .\nSomeone could come to our lawyer or us and say , \u201c Hey , you have the exclusive right to make and sell those clothes in the United States of America .\nI would like to buy the trademark for millions of dollars.\n\u201d If we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of money , we could donate that money to causes that we feel would benefit Black people , like the NAACP or Black Lives Matter organizations .\nBecause , realistically , we can not stop the shirts from being made right now .\nWe can write cease and desist to people

Compton , California .\nI was the president of the Black Student Union in college .\nI \u2019 ve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time .\nI know who I am , and my co-host definitely knows who he is .\nWe created our show to allow the leadership from the streets to come on and uplift our struggles , explain what defunding the police means , and explicitly say that Breonna Taylor \u2019 s killing was unjust .\nWe know that phrases like \u201c White Lives Matter , \u201d \u201c All Lives Matter , \u201d and \u201c Blue Lives Matter \u201d continue to cause harm and to dilute the narrative that was intended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those phrases are all piggybacking off of Black people \u2019 s creativity and efforts , so we \u2019 re all for helping to use this as a measure to allow Black people to retain a little bit of ownership .\nHow have you processed the last month of Kanye West \u2019 s actions as someone who \u2019 s deeply entrenched in that hip-hop community and Black life ?\nIt \u2019

Johnson , senior advisor at New America : I think so .\nTwo folks [ Lawson and Dunn ] that ran in [ Florida ] , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same district .\nThen , the Republican one won .\nSo , it mattered in a few races .\nAnd the biggest thing is that gerrymandering is probably going to be the reason Republicans win the House .\nThis year , they underperformed most of everyone \u2019 s expectations \u2014 certainly what the polls suggested .\nFor a while it looked like control of the House was going to come down to a couple of seats in New York .\nThe New York redistricting plan \u2026 made it easier for Republicans to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there \u2019 s no question that gerrymandering across the state is going to determine who wins the House this year , and it favors Republicans .\nThat \u2019 s without question .\nAs to whether or not gerrymandering in particular hurt Black candidates more ?\nI think you can find a couple of examples , but we also have to remember that a lot of Black folks in Congress are in Congress because they \u2019 re in gerrymandered districts .\nThe famous one is in North Carolina .\nU.S. Rep. Alma Adams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole bunch of Black folks into her district .\nI think the vast majority of Black members in the House represent districts that are majority Black , or at least plurality Black districts .\nThere are some Black representatives like [ Illinois Democratic U.S. Rep. ] Lauren Underwood , for example , who is representing a district that \u2019 s heavily minority , and it \u2019 s a purple district , and she won this cycle .\nSo gerrymandering cuts both ways .\nI \u2019 ve seen on social media folks calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to prevent Republicans from being the only party that practices and therefore winning not just more seats in Congress , but also in the state assemblies across the country .\nJamil Scott , assistant professor for Georgetown University \u2019 s government department : I think that folks are seeing that some of these key House races were a lot closer than we thought they would be or that we thought they should be .\nU.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes [ from Connecticut ] as an example .\nShe has been wonderful as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like she was on the verge of losing , and that \u2019 s largely due to what her districts look like .\nHer opponent , Republican George Logan , got a lot closer than you would think , given her status as an incumbent .\nYou have to think about how the shifting of districts matters \u2014 with someone who won the nomination handily , and then they \u2019 re having these problems winning it later on .\nEmmitt Riley III , associate professor of Political Science and Africana Studies at DePauw University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state legislature level over the last 10 years .\nThere \u2019 s been a lot of talk about how well [ incumbent Republican Gov . ]\nRon DeSantis did in Florida , and also Republican Sen.

Reno , the 1993 Supreme Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power in descriptive representation .\nIt would make sense to challenge the shape of districts , but I think that perhaps the sentiment might be , what is the court going to do , especially when we \u2019 re rehearing cases on issues that we felt was settled .\n\u2026 We \u2019 ve always known that the court is political , whether there was any doubt in people \u2019 s minds that the court is political .\nIf an organization , if an interest group is thinking about bringing a case like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Court , it may not bode as well .\nIt may lead to regression and not to the court being the progressive policymakers that we \u2019 ve seen it be in the past .\nCapital B : If gerrymandering disproportionately affects Black voters , what \u2019 s the solution , especially if the courts don \u2019 t get involved ?\nCan the redistricting process be done fairly ?\nJohnson : I think the right way ahead is the independent commissions where maybe you have three Republicans , three Democrats and three nonpartisan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , get together and redraw the districts in the state and then come to an agreement that makes every district competitive .\nThere \u2019 s a body of research out there that tries to determine when a district is no longer competitive .\nAnd one of the ones I \u2019 m most familiar with is called the efficiency gap .\nThey basically have a formula to calculate when a district is competitive and when it is no longer competitive .\nAnd so I think combining independent commissions with something like the efficiency gap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , which ideally would result in more fair elections .\nWhat happens when a commission can \u2019 t come to an agreement ?\nNot only do you need a commission , not only do you need statistical formulas to determine how to keep this competitive , but you need a conflict resolution to disputes for these commissions that don \u2019 t involve state legislators or politicized courts .\nAnd pulling all three of those things together is incredibly difficult to do .\nBut if we want a competitive Congress , if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote in the district , then to me , that seems like the right way forward .\nScott : Local politics .\nFor so long , I don \u2019 t think there \u2019 s been enough attention to what \u2019 s happening at the local level , and it \u2019 s still the case that politics is so nationalized .\nIf there \u2019 s going to be real change in state legislatures , there \u2019 s going to have to be a push like what we \u2019 re seeing in other states , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some of these candidates who \u2019 ve been well-established for a long time in state legislatures , and really considering the possibility of implementing nonpartisan redistricting processes in the future .\nRiley : There needs to be an immediate restoration of the Voting Rights Act , restoring section five [ requiring states with a history of discriminatory election practices to receive federal approval to change voting laws ] .\nWe just can \u2019 t stop there .\nWe \u2019 ve got to think about legislation that calls for the fair apportionment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within congressional districts , and where possible , allowing people \u2014 in particular people of color \u2014 to be placed in districts where they \u2019 re getting a fair set of representation .\nSo the accountability piece has to come from Congress writing legislation , and also holding elected officials accountable that when they have majorities , they are thinking about more fair and equitable ways to construct congressional districts .\nWhichever party is empowered to draw the maps typically draw maps that are more favorable to their political interests .\nWhat we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have these independent commissions that will engage in drawing maps , but also think the federal law needs to be clear about what constitutes a fair and equitable district where people are

carried out , how justice is rendered , and what legislation is prioritized in their states .\nIn several cases , the candidates elected to these roles \u2014 secretary of state , attorney general , and lieutenant governor \u2014 will be the first Black officials to hold those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general , Anthony Brown in Maryland and Andrea Campbell in Massachusetts , will become their states \u2019 chief lawyers , responsible for upholding federal laws and initiating civil suits when the state or its residents have been wronged by corporations .\nAttorneys general defend people whose civil

George Floyd \u2019 s murder .\nEllison , the first Black and first Muslim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this week .\nThe role of secretary of state is more important than ever , responsible for protecting the election process amid the rise of election denialism and attacks on voting rights .\nWhile the secretary of state has typically been an administrative position , Stephanie Thomas in Connecticut is entering the role in a highly politicized moment and Shirley Weber in California has been paving the way in her position since last year when California Gov .\nGavin Newsom appointed her .\nOfficials in this position have the power to expand voting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballots , or to suppress it by closing precincts or advocating for restrictions like voter ID laws .\nWhen it comes to lieutenant governors , while the role doesn \u2019 t have the power to sign bills into law , it is an influential position that could serve as a pipeline to the governor \u2019 s seat , said Melba Pearson , past president of The National Black Prosecutors Association .\nIn Pennsylvania , Austin Davis made history as the first Black person elected to the role in the battleground state , giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice , energy , and climate that could set national precedents .\n\u201c If we have more Black , brown , female lieutenant governors , that \u2019 s more amazing candidates to have in the pool to be able to run for governor .\nIn our 300-year history of this country , to only have had three Black governors is pretty disturbing when Black people are a significant population of the country , \u201d Pearson said .\n\u201c I think more Black lieutenant governors are going to be important .\n\u2026 They \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the governor \u2019 s mansion for the benefit of an entire state.\n\u201d Here \u2019 s what we can expect from the freshmen class of Black politicians who are joining state leadership : In Maryland , U.S. Rep. Anthony Brown \u2019 s campaign for attorney general focused on enforcing the laws that he has voted on during his term in Congress .\nThose laws include the Raise the Age Act , which increased the required age to purchase a semi-automatic rifle from 18 to 21 , and the BIAS Act , which funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bias training programs in conjunction with local police departments.\n\u201d The Democrat sponsored more than 150 pieces of legislation since 2019 , including the Robert E. Lee Statue Removal Act that would remove the confederate leader \u2019 s statue from the Antietam National Battlefield in Sharpsburg , Maryland .\nThe legislation has stalled in the Senate .\nBrown , who previously served as lieutenant governor under former Maryland Gov .\nMartin O \u2019 Malley , also prioritized criminal justice reform and reproductive and voting rights in his campaign .\nAttorneys general have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their state \u2019 s governor may try to implement that could cause harm to a protected class of citizens , noted Pearson .\nWhile Brown will serve with a Democratic governor with whom he aligns , Wes Moore , that power can be important for other attorneys general as rights for women and people of color come under attack .\n\u201c You can have a situation where you have a Republican governor who is anti-choice , and you have an attorney general that \u2019 s pro-choice , if that governor decides to implement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person \u2019 s right to choose , that attorney general can basically get in its way to support and pushback for the right to choose , \u201d Pearson said .\nIn Massachusetts , Andrea Campbell will be the second historic person to hold the position , replacing Attorney General Maura Healey , the country \u2019 s first openly queer attorney general .\nHealy won the state \u2019 s gubernatorial race this week .\nCampbell \u2019 s campaign framed the attorney general \u2019 s office as \u201c the people \u2019 s lawyer.\n\u201d A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providers who offer abortion and gender-affirming services , holding educational institutions accountable for serving students despite citizenship or socioeconomic status , and advocating for elderly people who are targets of fraud and scams .\nCampbell \u2019 s family has personal experience with the criminal justice system : Her twin brother died in jail while awaiting trial , and her other brother is incarcerated on allegations of sexual assault .\nAs a member of Boston \u2019 s City Council , Campbell created a police oversight division and said she would continue her efforts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the justice system .\nThe attorney general role has an \u201c authoritative position that can have a significant impact and influence on the way a state enforces law on African Americans , \u201d said Jeremy I. Levitt , professor of international law at Florida A & M University .\nFollowing the 2020 presidential election , the role of secretary of state became more apparent to everyday voters than ever .\nOn a secretly taped phone call in January 2021 , then-President Donald Trump allegedly threatened Georgia \u2019 s secretary of state to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would change the outcome of the election \u2014 having Trump win .\nThe Republican Party \u201c is realizing the importance of being able to play these games with the ballot box , \u201d Pearson said .\n\u201c They have been strategically targeting secretaries of state races across the country to be able to put more sympathetic people in power to be able to potentially squash future elections .\nSo that \u2019 s why it \u2019 s incredibly important.\n\u201d Since 2020 , dozens of states have implemented stricter voting laws and requirements that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ballot , especially in communities of color .\nAs a member of Connecticut \u2019 s House of Representatives , Stephanie Thomas \u2014 now the secretary of state-elect \u2014 sponsored bills that allowed for automatic voter registration , early voting , and no-excuse absentee ballot voting , according to her campaign website .\nShirley Weber was appointed California \u2019 s secretary of state in 2020 and won her first full term this week .\nThe secretary of state oversees the recall system , which nearly cost Newsom his position last year .\nWeber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told CalMatters.org that , if the governor gets recalled , she favors allowing the lieutenant governor to step in until a special election is held \u2014 instead of selecting a new governor on the same ballot .\nWeber \u2019 s other priorities include beefing up cybersecurity efforts and expanding access to the ballot , including voting rights to the formerly incarcerated and those on parole .\nDepending on the state , the lieutenant governor \u2019 s role is similar to the U.S. vice president , presiding over their state \u2019 s Senate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influencing the governor \u2019 s agenda .\n\u201c They can be very consequential because it is still a position of significant influence .\nThey \u2019 re at the table for all of the major decisions , \u201d Levitt said .\n\u201c They carry out the executive function for the governor \u2019 s office .\nThey have the ability to shape laws and policy and to implement them.\n\u201d Austin Davis was elected lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania , where he will serve alongside Gov.-elect Josh Shapiro .\nAs a state representative since 2018 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year \u2019 s session , and has pushed for increases to the minimum wage and expanding broadband access .\nHe will replace John Fetterman , the current lieutenant governor who won a high-profile U.S. Senate race against Mehmet Oz .\nAs lieutenant governor , Davis will also become the first Black chair of the state \u2019 s Board of Pardons , where he said he plans to continue Fetterman \u2019 s work as a champion for clemency .\n\u201c I think Lt.

tens of millions of borrowers .\nNow , the U.S. Department of Justice is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse the judge \u2019 s ruling and allow Biden \u2019 s debt forgiveness program to move forward .\nThe relief would be particularly helpful for Black borrowers , who owe a disproportionate amount of the $ 1.7 trillion in national student loan debt .\nBut as often happens with policies that benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slew of legal challenges .\nMost have been backed by conservative groups and Republican-led states , alleging racial discrimination , financial harm , or an overreach of presidential powers .\nMeanwhile , millions of Americans remain in financial limbo , uncertain when their next student-loan payment will come due and how much they will owe .\nWhen Biden announced the loan forgiveness plan in August , he also extended the freeze on loan payments until the end of the year .\nUnless there \u2019 s another extension , payments will be due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounding the debt relief has caused anxiety and confusion for borrowers , said Stanley Tate , student loan attorney with Tate Law .\n\u201c There \u2019 s an emotional [ toll ] of \u2018 I want to move on with my

the lawsuit against student debt relief about ?\nUnder Biden \u2019 s plan , borrowers who make $ 125,000 annually or less would see $ 10,000 in federal student loan debt wiped clean .\nPell Grant recipients \u2014 usually students who display extreme financial need \u2014 would get $ 20,000 .\nThose with undergraduate loans would also be able to cap their payments to 5 % of their monthly income .\nBiden justified his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003 .\nThe HEROES Act allows the Secretary of Education to waive or grant relief of student financial aid programs to people who have suffered economic hardship in response to military or national emergencies .\nTexas U.S. District Court Judge Mark Pittman , an appointee of former President Donald Trump , ruled on Nov. 10 that Biden \u2019 s program is \u201c unlawful \u201d because it circumvents congressional power .\nIn his ruling , Pittman said that the HEROES Act doesn \u2019 t give the executive branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 400 billion student loan forgiveness program .\nThe order introduced past examples of federal officials attempting to forgive loans through legislation or through executive action .\nSimilar to Biden , the Trump administration used the HEROES Act as a reason to forgive student loans because of the effects from the pandemic .\nThe Department of Education found that the request lacked such authority under the act .\n\u201c There are legitimate concerns about whether or not this is a proper exercise of use of authority by the president when he \u2019 s saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are related to the [ effects from the ] pandemic to provide cancellation benefits , \u201d Tate said .\nYou mentioned that there \u2019 s a slew of other lawsuits .\nWhat \u2019 s going on with those

injunction preventing the government from relieving any debt .\nThat order came in response to a lawsuit brought by six Republican-led states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Missouri , Nebraska , and South Carolina .\nThat lawsuit alleges Biden overstepped his authority and that loan cancellation could cause the states to lose tax revenue in the future .\nMissouri , one of the states in the case , further argued that the debt cancellation could allow its quasi-state loan servicer to suffer financial losses .\nA lower court dismissed the case in late October because the plaintiffs failed to show how anyone would be imminently harmed .\nBut an appeals court reversed that decision after determining that the Missouri loan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At least four other lawsuits have been filed .\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has rejected two lawsuits for a lack of legal standing .\nOne filed in Indiana was dismissed because a judge ruled that the plaintiff could not be irreparably harmed by the plan .\nAnother case in Wisconsin , filed on behalf of a group of taxpayers , argued that Biden \u2019 s plan has an \u201c improper racial motive \u201d because it would help Black borrowers and violates the constitutional rights of equal protection .\nSo race plays a role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawsuit , the Brown County Taxpayers Association alleged that the cost of the loan-relief program would force them to pay higher taxes .\nThe association also argued that the one-time relief was created to \u201c advance racial equity , meaning the purpose is to narrow the racial wealth gap by helping Black students , Black borrowers , and other borrowers of color , \u201d the lawsuit said .\nU.S. District Court Judge William Griesbach dismissed the lawsuit in early October .\nAfterward , the Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty , the conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency petition to the U.S. Supreme Court to block the program .\nThe request was denied .\nThere are several recent examples of white people taking legal action against federal agencies whose policies help Black folks .\nLast year , a group of white farmers filed a class-action lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Agriculture , arguing that a $ 4 billion federal loan forgiveness program for farmers of color unfairly excluded them .\nThe lawsuit halted the program , which was replaced in September by a new iteration that offers assistance to @ @ @ @ @

COVID-19 relief under the Restaurant Revitalization Fund .\nThe American Rescue Plan allowed a three-week period for people of color who owned businesses to request relief from the fund .\nA federal court in Texas and a federal appeals court in Ohio ruled the parts of the law regarding race were unconstitutional .\nWith all these outstanding lawsuits , will the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment freeze ?\nThe pause on student loan payments , instituted at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic , ends Dec. 31 .\nWhite House officials have said they \u2019 re considering extending the pause beyond January 2023 , but there has not been an official announcement .\nFor now , student loan payments will be due again beginning Jan. 1 Should I still apply for loan forgiveness ?\nThe Department of Education is

the chances that student debt will be forgiven ?\nRight now , the U.S. Supreme Court would need to intervene to revive student debt relief .\nAnother option is for Congress to cancel the debt , but

lawsuits against the state for failing to protect them from sexual violence they say they experienced while in prison .\nThe new law is part of a wave of reforms across the country that expands the statute of limitations on sexual offenses .\nThis year , five states and the federal government passed legislation that eliminates or lengthens the statute of limitations of existing criminal and civil laws , giving victims more time to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Adult Survivor Act in New York makes way for victims to specifically file claims about sexual assault in state correctional facilities , which carry a long history of abuse .\nThe pending cases allege that since the 1970s , New York state had been made aware , through lawsuits and Justice Department reports , that incarcerated women were being sexually assaulted by prison staffers but did nothing to stop it .\nAt a press conference about the claims on Nov. 16 in Lower Manhattan , three Black women gave gut-wrenching testimonies about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their sentences .\nOne of the women said that while serving a sentence at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in Westchester County , New York , she was raped by a guard for six

gloomy , drawn-out winter months as \u201c cuffing season , \u201d made perfect by dropping temperatures and \u201c cuddle weather.\n\u201d It \u2019 s when you hole in with your chosen partner or community , binge-watch television , and , if you \u2019 re lucky , crank up the heater while darkness takes over outside .\nBut the winter months are not always Hallmark Channel-worthy .\nAt the start of winter , as our bodies adjust to less sunlight and colder temperatures , our serotonin levels often dip , leading to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affective disorder , or SAD .\nSymptoms of SAD include fatigue , irritability , low energy , problems concentrating , increased need for sleep , change in appetite , drastic weight change , and feeling like \u201c hibernating.\n\u201d While SAD affects more than 10 million Americans annually , the disorder affects women four times more than men .\nMore than 500,000 Americans are hospitalized every year because of the condition .\nResearchers believe

States , Black and Latino people are more likely to be at risk for depression than white people , according to a 2018 study that included more than 12,000 participants from 2005 to 2012 .\nThe study attempted to account for historical drivers of depression in Black communities , including chronic stress due to racism and economic inequality .\nEven when considered , Black participants were still more likely to be at risk for depression , the study concluded .\nGenerally , seasonal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linked to long , drawn-out winters , but it can linger all-year round , experts contend .\nWhile winter SAD tends to look like oversleeping , summer SAD often shows up with insomnia and lowered appetite .\nDuring the summer , an added challenge presents itself for folks experiencing SAD : the social expectation of enjoying the sunshine and outdoor events .\nIn the winter , the seemingly nonstop avalanche of holidays also adds a specific kind of pressure for communal joy .\nThe Mayo Clinic asserts that seasonal depression \u201c begins and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , \u201d but with climate change disrupting the standard timeframes for our weather cycles , the expected SAD period may become more irregular .\nIn the Northwest and Mountain West , winter is becoming more intense , while in the Midwest , South , and Northeast , the concentration of cold weather months is experiencing a downward shift .\nAnd across all 50 states , the summer heatwave season has increased since 1961 .\nThe world \u2019 s largest climate collective , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , has repeatedly acknowledged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and severe weather events are linked to stress , trauma , grief , anxiety , and suicide .\nErratic seasons don \u2019 t bode well for SAD , either , especially in Black communities , which are most at-risk for flooding and environmental pollution .\nHowever , there are proven ways to mitigate SAD \u2019 s impact on Black communities .\nA 2015 study found that when offered light therapy , a treatment involving exposure to an artificial light source that mimics outdoor light , Black participants were less likely to continue experiencing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white participants .\nWith the holiday season quickly approaching and the daunting reality of climate change creeping into everyone \u2019 s daily life , Capital B sat down with Mychelle Williams , a Washington , D.C.-based therapist who focuses on Black mental health , to talk about SAD , its impact on Black life , and the various ways to cope , such as light therapy .\nCapital B : How did you get into the mental health space in the first place ?\nMychelle Williams : I \u2019 m a Philadelphia native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an HBCU in New Orleans , to study psychology , and during the research that I was doing , I got interested in the practical application of neuroscience research .\nAfter undergrad , I went to the Chicago School of Professional Psychology , where I specialized in childhood and adolescent trauma .\nI chose that specialty because , in my internships , I realized many adults I worked with had experienced something traumatizing as children or teens .\nI thought it would be appropriate to go right to the source to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done .\nSince then , I \u2019 ve worked in prisons and I \u2019 ve worked at elementary , middle , and high schools .\nI \u2019 ve also done some diversity work and advocacy at the graduate level .\nRecently , I have connected with somatic therapies that help people become more connected to their bodies , help them move trauma through their bodies , and help them reprocess stressful experiences .\nWhy do you think it \u2019 s so important to have folks in this space who specialize and specifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identities ?\nSo for you , that \u2019 s focusing on Black folks and queer folks in this space .\nIt is important because we , as Black people , when I say we , I mean Black people and Black queer people : We don \u2019 t have spaces dedicated to us in general .\nWe don \u2019 t have a lot of bookstores , clubs , restaurants , neighborhoods , resources that are specifically created with us in mind .\nWe \u2019 re expected to get in where we fit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a lot of places .\nSo it \u2019 s really important to have spaces , especially therapeutic ones that aren \u2019 t just therapy but things that can be healing and restorative that center and serve people with marginalized identities so that the experience doesn \u2019 t further harm us .\nThis is why I conduct therapy with Black , queer , and trans people in mind .\nWhen we \u2019 re talking about the causes of seasonal depression and the specific ways it shows up for Black folks in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nTypically , the conversation around seasonal depression comes up around the winter months , but it \u2019 s not just about winter .\nIt comes up around the winter because there are fewer hours of daylight and Black people are highly likely to be vitamin D deficient .\nVitamin D deficiency affects our mood , energy , and ability to concentrate and focus , among other physical health things .\nAnd so the less light we have access to , the more likely we \u2019 re going to find ourselves feeling stressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less motivated .\nMany of us have circadian rhythms , so when it gets dark , it makes us sleepy and want to wind down .\nIt symbolizes the end of the day , but the end of the day , sometimes looks like 4 p.m. or 5 p.m. , depending on what region you \u2019 re in .\nSo it does take a toll , not even to be able to use sunlight to gauge time .\nIt impacts people in all contexts , though .\nPeople living in warmer climates and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still be affected by seasonal depression , especially if you \u2019 re on the East Coast .\nThey have to navigate daylight saving time and fewer sun hours a day , which lowers the opportunity for socializing and impacts people \u2019 s motivation to engage in whatever type of enriching or extracurricular activities they were doing outside the house .\nBecause of the global pandemic , many people lost access to being in community and pursuing certain hobbies because they were trying to protect their health .\nAnd so , today especially , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When we look at depression more generally in the United States , studies show that Black folks , for numerous reasons \u2014 chronic stress , racism , and poverty \u2014 are more likely to be at risk for depression .\nDoes that show up in your work for seasonal depression ?\nAbsolutely .\nI recently saw this meme , it \u2019 s like a whole bunch of different Spider-Mans pointing at each other , but really it is all the different types of depression pointing at each other .\nWe are living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world is depressing .\nSo we have the depression that we experience , and then we have depression as a symptom .\nDepressing circumstances can be the crushing weight of capitalism , a global pandemic , and multiple members of our community being killed and broadcast all over the news .\nAll happening on top of my existing low-level depression , such as seasonal depression or work burnout .\nIt \u2019 s never just one thing .\nWe \u2019 re talking about navigating things happening in our personal lives , our families , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWe \u2019 re holding that type of stress and concern , and then in a season where it is harder to be happy because we don \u2019 t even have enough sunlight .\nDo you have any major tips on how to address the ways that seasonal depression might show up in our lives ?\n\u2022 Add Vitamin D supplements and some herbal supplements to your regimen .\nThese will help your body produce and absorb vitamin D. Other supplements include lion \u2019 s mane , ashwagandha , and magnesium .\n\u2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you should start a few weeks before the season starts to get into a groove .\nBuild a routine about the things you care about , the community you care about \u2014 in-person and digitally \u2014 and make sure that we are active and intentional and leaning into those communities .\n\u2022 There are certain types of light therapies that are really helpful for people who are experiencing seasonal depression symptoms because of the lack of sunlight .\nThere are warm lamps that we can put in our

Where They Live", "content": "This story originally appeared in The Daily Yonder .\nWhen Cesar Martinez started feeling the pain in his mouth , he knew his battle to get his wisdom teeth taken care of would be a tough one .\nMartinez lives in Newburgh , New York , a city of 29,000 residents about 40 miles north of New York City .\nGetting to a surgeon who participated in Martinez \u2019 insurance plan meant a 45-minute or longer trip into the city , plus an undetermined amount of time waiting for an appointment .\nDr. Cameron Lewis , DDS , had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw helping Martinez as just part of the job .\nReaching rural residents , like those in Sleepy Hollow , New York , and Bethel , Connecticut , who may not otherwise have access to oral surgeons , has been a calling since Lewis \u2019 sophomore year in college .\nRural residents are less likely to have access to specialized dental health care treatments .\nTo help fill that need , Lewis decided early on in his career to travel to provide oral surgery where those services may not be available .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d he said in an interview with the Daily Yonder .\nLewis said he knew from the time that he was 12 years old that he wanted to be in some form of medicine .\nWhen he was an undergraduate , he was inspired by a trip to South Africa .\n\u201c I went there to see how primary care was handled in South Africa , and we went to all the rural areas in the country , \u201d he said .\n\u201c It was so touching because I saw things I \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The waiting rooms were packed .\nThe ER was packed .\nThe doctor was there for like six hours and no other doctor would be there for weeks and weeks .\nI saw so many patients holding their mouths .\n\u2026 I saw there was a need in dentistry.\n\u201d Lewis said getting into oral surgery took time .\nAfter a number of rejections , he was able to get into dental school and finish his education in oral surgery .\n\u201c I never gave up .\nI kept going , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said .\n\u201c When I got finished , I saw the need that was all around , and I thought \u2018 Why be limited to one office when I can just move around and open up a business where I can spread myself around ?\n\u2019 \u201d For the past eight years , Lewis has traveled to parts of upstate New York and western Connecticut to work out of other dentist \u2019 s offices .\nUsing

local surgeon has time to see them .\n\u201c The nearest doctors only came in once or twice a month , \u201d Martinez said .\n\u201c I was in a lot of pain .\nDr. Lewis took out all four of my wisdom teeth .\nHe told me that I needed a bone graft so I wouldn \u2019 t get any sinus infections or have problems breathing .\nI told him I didn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance wouldn \u2019 t cover it .\n\u2026 He said , \u2018 Don \u2019 t worry about it.\n\u2019 And he did it anyway.\n\u201d According to a policy brief from the National Rural Health Association , over 46 million Americans lived in a dental health professional shortage area as of 2018 .\nOf those , two-thirds were in rural areas , the policy brief said .\nDemand for dental care is expected to continue to grow , with rural communities expected to experience greater shortages of general dentists and dental specialists .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ more health problems , researchers at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine have found .\nPatients who live in rural areas experience a disproportionate burden of oral health disease , owing to an under-resourced and remote health care infrastructure , often complicated by geographic challenges .\nStatistically , rural communities have less access to dental care , which leads to higher rates of tooth decay in children and advanced periodontal disease in adults .\nPoor oral health can lead to missed days at school and work , impair speech , affect nutrition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lack of access to dental health care is also linked to diseases like cardiovascular disease , pancreatic cancer , and others .\nOther factors that affect rural oral health are lack of fluoridated water and higher than average levels of tobacco use .\nFor Lewis , meeting new people every day , and helping those who might not have otherwise gotten help is the reward .\nDental surgery , he said , can be life changing .\n\u201c It changes the way people view themselves , \u201d he said .\n\u201c There \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so embarrassed because they don \u2019 t look at dentistry as a priority .\n\u2026 A lot of times people hide [ their dental issues ] .\nThey don \u2019 t want to smile or don \u2019 t want anyone to see they don \u2019 t have any teeth , or that their teeth don \u2019 t look good .\nWhen you change that \u2026 and give them a whole different smile \u2026 they feel so much happier than they were before .\nYou see a big difference.\n\u201d Lewis estimates that about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does .\nMost , he said , prefer to have their own office and their own clients .\nBut Lewis said his priority is making as much of a difference as he can for those in need .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not about having [ my ] own office , it \u2019 s about what makes a difference in people

"content": "During a routine visit to the Good Samaritan Clinic in Morganton , North Carolina , in 2018 , Herbert Buff casually mentioned that he sometimes had trouble breathing .\nHe was 55 years old and a decades-long smoker .\nSo the doctor recommended that Buff schedule time on a 35-foot-long bus operated by the Levine Cancer Institute that would roll through town later that week offering free lung-cancer screenings .\nBuff found the \u201c lung bus \u201d concept odd , but he \u2019 s glad he hopped on .\n\u201c I learned that you can have lung cancer and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was diagnosed at stage 1 by doctors in the rolling clinic .\n\u201c The early screening might have saved my life .\nIt might \u2019 ve given me quite a few more years.\n\u201d The lung bus is a big draw in this rural area of western North Carolina because some people aren \u2019 t comfortable going \u2014 and in many cases have no access \u2014 to a hospital or doctor \u2019 s office , said Darcy Doege , coordinator for the screening program .\n\u201c Our team makes people feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can see up to 30 patients a day who get referred by their primary care doctor or their pulmonologist , but we also accommodate walk-ups.\n\u201d Lung cancer is the deadliest of all cancers .\nIt grows quietly and is usually not detected until it has spread to other parts of the body .\nEarly detection is key to survival , especially for someone at high risk like Buff , who is African American and has a history of smoking .\nAlthough it is well documented that Black smokers develop lung cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they smoke fewer cigarettes , the guidelines that doctors use to recommend patients for screening have been slow to reflect the disparity .\nIf Buff had the same conversation with his doctor one year earlier , he would not have qualified for the CT scan that detected a nickel-sized growth on his left lung .\nBut screening is only part of the issue , said experts who evaluate what happens both before and after a person is checked for signs of cancer .\nResearchers are concerned about the lack of diverse representation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screening recommendations are based .\nFor example , about 13 % of the U.S. population is Black , but Black people made up just 4.4 % of participants in the National Lung Screening Trial , a large , multiyear study in the early 2000s that looked at whether screening with low-dose CT scans could reduce mortality from lung cancer .\nBasing guidelines on trials with so little diversity can lead to delayed disease detection and higher mortality rates , said Dr. Carol Mangione , chair of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendations about services such as screenings , behavioral counseling , and preventive medications .\nIts recommendations play a major role in determining which tests and procedures health insurance companies will agree to pay for .\n\u201c We know that Black people get diagnosed with and tend to die more from colon cancer , for example , \u201d Mangione said .\n\u201c But we don \u2019 t have sufficient evidence to say that there should be a different recommendation for Black people , because Black people have not historically been well represented in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with lung cancer , the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended screening for people who were 55 and older and had a smoking history of 30 \u201c pack years , \u201d which means the person smoked an average of one pack of cigarettes a day for three decades .\nBuff made the cut .\nBut a 2019 study published in JAMA Oncology found that under those parameters , 68 % of Black smokers would have been ineligible for screening at the time of their lung cancer diagnosis , compared with 44 % of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Preventive Services Task Force lowered the recommended screening age for lung cancer to 50 and reduced the number of pack years to 20 .\nThe new guidelines make 8 million more Americans eligible to be screened .\nBut that \u2019 s not the only problem that needs to be addressed , said Dr. Gerard Silvestri , a lung cancer pulmonologist at the Medical University of South Carolina .\n\u201c It doesn \u2019 t matter if a bunch more African Americans are eligible if they have no coverage , distrust the medical system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silvestri said .\n\u201c You might exacerbate this disparity , \u201d he said , \u201c because more whites will also become eligible and are likely to have more access.\n\u201d Silvestri co-leads the Medical University of South Carolina \u2019 s portion of a $ 3 million , four-year Stand Up to Cancer grant-funded project focused on addressing lung cancer disparities .\nResearchers in the multicenter collaboration \u2014 which also includes the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill and the Massey Cancer Center at Virginia Commonwealth University \u2014 said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underserved communities .\n\u201c Patients of color , particularly Black patients , tend to have less access to care , less timely follow-up when there \u2019 s an abnormal finding , and later stages of diagnosis , \u201d said epidemiologist Louise Henderson , principal investigator for the study at the Lineberger center .\nIt takes concerted community efforts to contend with the suite of health disparities that result in poor outcomes for communities of color , experts said .\nThe lung bus that Buff visited is just one example of how cancer researchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe Atrium Health Levine Cancer Institute in Charlotte , North Carolina , launched the effort in March 2017 to make screening more accessible to underserved people in vulnerable communities who are either uninsured or underinsured .\nThe bus operates in 19 counties in North and South Carolina .\nIn an analysis published in the journal The Oncologist in 2020 , the Levine Cancer Institute said the project had identified 12 cancers in 550 patients and called the results \u201c policy changing.\n\u201d By September 2021 , the researchers said , the bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients .\n\u201c Of which 21 were at the potentially curable stage , \u201d said Dr. Derek Raghavan , president of the Levine Cancer Institute and lead author of the analysis .\nAbout 78 % of the people screened were poor and from rural areas , he said , and 20 % were Black Americans .\n\u201c You can overcome disparities of care if you really want to , \u201d Raghavan said .\nThe Lineberger center also partnered with federally qualified health centers in the Raleigh-Durham area and recruited community health advisers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer and the ease of being screened .\nIt also trained patient and financial navigators to assist with the often-overwhelming aftermath of a diagnosis .\nRecent studies in JAMA Oncology and the Journal of the National Cancer Institute have found that Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act improves overall cancer survival among all racial and ethnic groups and reduces racial disparities in cancer survival .\nAmong the three research sites participating in the lung cancer disparities project , the Massey Cancer Center in Virginia is the only one in a state that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director of community outreach engagement and health disparities at the Massey center , said she has seen anecdotal evidence that expanding health care coverage improves cancer screening rates .\nNonetheless , awareness about screening remains low in the Black community .\nSheppard believes that may be because general health care providers are not educating patients on the available screening tools .\nA low-dose CT scan , for example , is one of the most powerful tools available for detecting lung cancer early and reducing deaths .\nBut according to the 2022 Lung Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly 70 % of people don \u2019 t even know that type of screening is available .\nAnd according to Silvestri , only a small percentage of those who are eligible actually get screened .\nPerhaps the final hurdle is erasing disparities in who gets follow-up care after screening .\nA study published in 2020 in the journal BMC Cancer found that Black patients who had been referred to a lung cancer screening program were still less likely than white patients to get screened and that they had longer delays in seeking follow-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henderson said some patients may mistakenly believe lung cancer is untreatable and simply don \u2019 t want to hear bad news .\nSheppard said screening can be used to educate and build trust with patients .\n\u201c Once we get people in the system , it \u2019 s up to us to make sure they know what \u2019 s expected , that it \u2019 s not a one-time thing , and that we are embedding them within the system of care , \u201d she said .\n\u201c I think that \u2019 s going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaiser Health News ) is a national

decline of diversity in the industry .\nDuring the pandemic , access to capital became an even larger barrier for farmers trying to keep their farms or , in the case of new farmers , obtain land .\nFarmer-activists Olivia Watkins and Karen Washington met at a conference in 2017 , sharing their frustrations about the disparities in government funding to Black farmers .\nSince that meeting , Watkins said , they have heard several stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lenders setting interest rates as high as 12 % .\nOther farmers simply felt \u201c they could not trust \u201d lenders because they didn \u2019 t see \u201c people that look like them on the underwriting team or lending team , \u201d she said .\nThe problems pushed Watkins and Washington into activism \u2014 informing government officials on challenges in farming , supporting farmers in filing civil rights complaints against agencies , and pushing for legislation that directly impacts their community .\nThey were particularly excited about the Justice for Black Farmers Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cory Booker in 2021 .\nThe act would have provided land grants , training , and education , as well as created a national bank for financing and credit assistance specifically for farmers of color .\nThe bill did not advance .\nBetween 1910 and 2007 , the USDA denied loans to women and people of color at higher rates than it did to white men , which contributed to the billions of dollars in land loss .\nDuring that same period , Black farmers lost 80 % of their farmland .\nMore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer more than $ 4 billion in debt relief for farmers of color , banking associations argued that paying back loans early would cause them to lose income .\nIn a letter to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack , the organizations said that if the USDA \u201c does not compensate lenders for such disruptions or avoid sudden loan payoffs , the likely result will be less access to credit for those seeking USDA guaranteed loans in the future.\n\u201d This would impact socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers , which are largely people of color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lenders , many Black farmers turn to their fellow neighbors in times of need .\nThey share equipment and other resources to stay afloat , but many others don \u2019 t survive .\nTo tackle this financial crisis , Watkins and Washington in 2017 formed the nonprofit Black Farmer Fund , an investment fund that offers grants and low-interest loans , technical assistance , and financial education in hopes of building wealth for folks in the agriculture community .\nSince last year , the organization raised over $ 1 million in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 613,000 in grants and low-interest loans to eight Black farmers , herbalists , and food businesses across New York .\nWe spoke to Watkins , president of the Black Farmer Fund , to learn more about how the program provides financial support to Black farmers in the Northeast and the ways racial justice shows up in their food systems work .\nCapital B : One challenge Black farmers face is being able to trust federal agencies like the USDA or government officials when it comes to funding .\nWas this a challenge for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a bit easier to build trust because you look like them ?\nOlivia Watkins : When the initial founding team came together , there was already that decades-long trust that had been built with the community and excitement around this work because the community that we have been serving knew that they could trust the founding individuals .\nAs we \u2019 ve continued to build out the organization , we have made sure to make space for people who have passion for agriculture , who \u2019 ve had farms before and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skill sets .\nOur investment director , he \u2019 s mainly been working in finance and that \u2019 s a skill set .\nBut , he \u2019 s had a hobby farm before where he managed livestock .\nWe \u2019 ve been intentional around bringing people into the organization that have a connection to the community that we \u2019 re interested in serving .\nWhat resources do you provide ?\nWhat is the funding model ?\nWe do three different areas of work .\nOur first area of work is growing community wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and loan capital .\nThe second area of work is planting knowledge and resources .\nAnd so that is really once people get their foot in the door of having the access to capital , making sure that they have the networks and whatever technical assistance they need to be able to sustain that capital and sustain themselves in the broader agricultural community .\nPart of our work is feeding social capital .\nWe work collaboratively with other organizations that are part of the larger food justice movement to make sure that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not it \u2019 s collective fundraising , collective advocacy at the policy level , or partnering with one another to provide services \u2014 just making sure that we \u2019 re contributing to the larger movements of food justice and racial justice that has been here way longer than we have .\nHow many businesses have you helped so far ?\nWe have eight businesses that we \u2019 ve invested in .\nWith these businesses , we \u2019 ve been able to provide them with access to capital .\nSome of the really great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are being able to connect people with access to markets .\nWe have farmers that we work with who are able to sell to vendors that were distributing their produce in Bushwick ( a neighborhood in Brooklyn , New York ) and communities predominantly of color .\nWe have folks who were able to access bookkeeping services , which is typically a high cost , so that they can be able to organize their finances better .\nWe have folks that have been able to access greenhouses and have been able to triple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce .\nAnd then we \u2019 ve also had people who have been able to continue to sustain themselves throughout COVID .\nA lot of farmers have had very hard times during COVID , and so just being able to provide that capital so that way people can stay on their feet has also been instrumental .\nHow do you choose which businesses to fund ?\nWe have a very straightforward kind of intake and screening process that allows us to be made aware of some of the different organizations or businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin our relationship building , and the businesses will then be evaluated for whether or not they meet our investment criteria .\nOur investment criteria has three pillars to it .\nThe first pillar is what they \u2019 re

Survivors Don\u2019t Bring Justice for All", "content": "There has been a gradual wave of reform efforts across the country granting sexual assault survivors more time to sue their alleged abusers .\nWith New York \u2019 s Adult Survivor Act taking effect last month , about half of states have either eliminated or expanded their statute of limitations on sexual offenses , including five states just this year .\nBut for some Black survivors , seeking justice through financial compensation may not be a realistic route , legal and sexual assault advocates say .\nFor many , their abuser is an acquaintance , intimate partner or relative who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay a significant judgment .\nFor others , if the attack was connected to their work , the abuser \u2019 s employer might avoid investigating or conceding that a crime occurred to mitigate the company \u2019 s liability .\nSurvivors also shy away from reporting their assault to avoid the trauma of retelling their experience .\nBecause Black women in particular rarely report their assaults to police , laws like New York \u2019 s have limited benefit , said advocate Kalimah Johnson .\n\u201c Let me be clear about Black folks , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just for anything .\nWe don \u2019 t go to the criminal justice system for anything because our communities are already over policed , \u201d said Johnson , founder of Sexual Assault Services for Holistic Healing and Awareness ( SASHA Center ) , an organization that provides resources for individuals who experienced sexual violence .\n\u201c Because of that , this bill , to be honest with you , will not impact Black people no more than it has in the past , no more than any other law that has passed.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been applauded by many survivor advocacy groups for expanding the legal options available to victims and for recognizing that it can take victims years to remember or report their attacks .\nBut racial justice advocate L \u2019 Tomay Douglas calls them a \u201c Band-Aid approach , \u201d saying that many were written with a focus on powerful institutions , so they don \u2019 t apply to the majority of cases for Black survivors .\n\u201c If you were assaulted in the Boy Scouts of America , or by the diocese , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the institution covered it up , you can sue .\nHow many of that will be the case for Black women ?\n\u201d said Douglas , who works as a social worker and restorative equity educator .\n\u201c It \u2019 s the same thing with the # MeToo movement .\nIt really helped those on a higher socioeconomic status than those who are just in blue-collar jobs.\n\u201d Studies show that Black girls and women experience rape at higher rates than their white counterparts .\nAccording to The National Center on Violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 in 4 Black girls has experienced sexual violence before their 18th birthday , and 35 % of Black women survived some form of sexual violence in their lifetime .\nThat \u2019 s particularly true when it comes to intimate partner violence , and women are more likely to remain silent if their abuser is an immediate relative with financial responsibilities within their home .\nThe hours , days , months , and years to follow while keeping one or more violent attacks a secret weighs on a survivor emotionally , mentally and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re wearing the weight of their entire family on their shoulders , \u201d Douglas said , and they \u2019 re fearful that they won \u2019 t be believed by law enforcement , which often fails to recognize Black survivors as victims .\nTo better help victims , advocates say that sex crime laws should fund therapy and other trauma support , while using education and \u201c restorative justice \u201d practices to treat perpetrators .\nRestorative justice practices are an alternative to incarceration for admitted abusers that helps treat their trauma .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of this are Black women , and the people who are less likely to have resources or access and even support are Black women .\nSo there needs to be something that \u2019 s embedded in all of these laws \u2026 to raise awareness with a call to action for all to participate in prevention , \u201d Douglas said .\n\u201c This can be done by increasing funding to grassroots organizations , especially those that serve Black communities where the code of silence was learned from enslavement and passed down.\n\u201d New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which took effect on Thanksgiving Day , allows survivors to file a lawsuit against their alleged perpetrator as well as the company or institution that the alleged perpetrator was employed by or associated with at the time .\nAs a result of the new law , more than 750 mostly Black people who were incarcerated in a New York state prison sued the state for failing to protect them from sexual assault during their sentences .\nSixty percent of rapes against incarcerated women were committed by jail or prison staffers , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ & Incest National Network ( RAINN ) of Justice Department data .\nInstead of focusing on providing financial restitution to victims , officials should work on preventing the assaults from happening in the first place , said Angela Allen-Bell , an associate professor with Southern University Law Center .\n\u201c If we were to address those documented problems , then we don \u2019 t need to create a pathway into court for people to fight for rapes that should have never happened , because statistically we \u2019 ve been warned that they \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While Allen-Bell applauds the New York law for acknowledging that the trauma of sexual assault may cause a delay in a survivor \u2019 s memory , there are other challenges to seeking legal recourse , she said .\nParticularly for Black survivors , juries can pose another major hurdle .\nRacial stereotypes and implicit biases about Black women can cloud jurors \u2019 perceptions of Black women as victims , Allen-Bell said , reducing chances that they are awarded appropriate compensation for their pain and suffering or a unanimous guilty verdict .\n\u201c When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of how much your life is worth , how much your pain and suffering is worth , race always covers that , as well .\nWe know Black people have a shorter lifespan , so the dollars are going to show you to be worth less , \u201d Allen-Bell said .\n\u201c Many people don \u2019 t understand that pain and suffering is shaped by that jury , who decides those things based on the racial hierarchy that we \u2019 ve been socialized under .\nAnd this country does not see Black people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who need to be protected from others \u2014 that is not the perception.\n\u201d Johnson , the founder of SASHA Center , said she witnessed racial disparities in how law enforcement responds to sexual assault or rape allegations during her tenure at the Detroit Police Department , which ended in 2005 .\nThere wasn \u2019 t a sense of urgency to investigate for Black victims , she said , unless the attacks were connected to a high-profile person , agency , or family .\n\u201c I had officers tell me \u2014 Black male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to take pictures of her bruises because she \u2019 s too dark .\nBut if a lighter skinned woman came in there , they \u2019 re pulling out all the stops , \u201d said Johnson , who experienced sexual violence .\n\u201c So there was light skin privilege happening , white privilege happening , male patriarchy happening ; all of that is what \u2019 s happening in the system .\nSo I literally quit.\n\u201d A year before SASHA Center received its nonprofit status in 2010 , a Wayne County , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untested rape kits that dated back to 1984 in an abandoned building that was scheduled to be demolished .\nThirteen years later , all of the abandoned kits have been processed , and 81 % of the DNA collected were from Black survivors within the Detroit area .\nWayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy \u2019 s office secured 239 convictions and identified 841 suspected serial offenders whose alleged actions spanned 40 states .\nEarlier this year , Michigan lawmakers proposed a series of bills that would expand the statute of limitations for survivors to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c Michigan \u2019 s civil statute of limitations is among the narrowest in the country , \u201d according to a March press release announcing the bills .\nThe bill would allow sexual assault survivors to file a claim against their alleged abuser up until their 48th birthday , 10 years from the date of the sexual assault or seven years after discovering they were abused , \u201c depending on which deadline is latest , \u201d according to the press release by the state \u2019 s House Democrats .\nIf the bill passes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conviction will have unlimited time to file a lawsuit .\nDouglas urges lawmakers to go further to reform the criminal justice system by implementing rehabilitation and trauma treatment policies for sexual assault perpetrators and other incarcerated individuals to help address what put them behind bars in the first place .\n\u201c These laws are not helping us in the long run .\nIt \u2019 s not helping us feel safe in our bodies , even after we get money .\nIt \u2019 s not helping us feel like we have our worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d Douglas said .\n\u201c It needs to be something that \u2019 s further than just saying , \u2018 Here , you can file a claim to get justice.\n\u2019 I think that \u2019 s a disservice

233-year history .\nJust a couple of months in , the Biden appointee has made waves on the nation \u2019 s high court , quickly building a reputation for incisive questions and unapologetic commentary .\nAlready , her inaugural term has been loaded with high-profile cases .\nIn the coming months , the court could determine the strength of the Voting Rights Act in protecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom allows creative business owners to discriminate against same-sex couples , and decide the future of affirmative action in higher education .\nBelying her freshman status , Jackson has been exceptionally vocal during oral arguments , not hesitating to challenge the court \u2019 s conservative supermajority , made up of appointees of former presidents Donald Trump and George W. Bush .\nIn her first weeks on the high court , Jackson wrote dissenting opinions in support of two Black men on death row .\nShe provided a history lesson on the \u201c race-conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguments over gerrymandering in Alabama .\nAnd she directly challenged an attorney \u2019 s arguments against considering racial diversity in college admissions .\n\u201c All of these cases that are talking about rights , access , representation , ability for care \u2014 they \u2019 re all directly disproportionately affecting African American people , \u201d said Ada Goodly Lampkin , director of the Louis A.

Justice [ Sonia ] Sotomayor and Justice [ Elena ] Kagan have alluded to that in past cases , but to say that we now have a person that is very vocal and unafraid to talk about race and the circumstances , this is one where we need her voice the most.\n\u201d Jackson made her presence known , speaking at least 6,000 more words than any other judge during the court \u2019 s first eight oral arguments of the term .\nThe former federal public defender and appellate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Adam Feldman , who runs the Empirical SCOTUS blog , in an interview with The New York Times .\nWhile it \u2019 s not unusual for a freshman justice to comment during their first weeks , Jackson spoke more words during the court \u2019 s first oral arguments on Oct. 3 than any of the other current justices during their first arguments .\n\u201c It is unusual for the junior justice to be as outspoken as she is , but she \u2019 s also an unusual junior justice as the first Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Rakim Brooks , president of Alliance for Justice , a national coalition of progressive legal organizations .\n\u201c So I think it should be applauded , particularly because there have been a lot of good studies about the extent to which the male justices interrupt the female justices , and so forth .\nSo let \u2019 s just say that she \u2019 s making up for lost time for women who served on that court.\n\u201d Here \u2019 s a look at some of Jackson \u2019 s most notable moments on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominated Jackson to the court to replace Justice Stephen Breyer , who retired from the lifetime position in June .\nBreyer often joined in dissenting opinions with other liberal justices Sotomayor and Kagan for topics such as emergency applications for capital punishment cases \u2014 a role Jackson seems to be taking over .\nJackson wrote her first opinion on Nov. 7 on stopping the death penalty proceedings for Davel Chinn in Ohio after a majority of the justices declined to hear the case .\nJackson \u2019 s dissent \u2014 joined by Sotomayor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court \u2014 argued that Chinn hadn \u2019 t received a fair trial .\nChinn was convicted and sentenced to death for the 1989 murder and robbery of a 21-year-old man .\nThe prosecution \u2019 s key witness to the crime was a teenager who was born with a birth defect that significantly reduced his IQ \u2014 information that was not revealed until after the Chinn \u2019 s conviction .\n\u201c There is no dispute that , during the capital trial of petitioner Davel Chinn , the State suppressed exculpatory evidence indicating that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marvin Washington , had an intellectual disability that may have affected Washington \u2019 s ability to remember , perceive fact from fiction , and testify accurately , \u201d Jackson wrote .\nJackson \u201c understands how many critical failures that we have had with the death penalty and with prosecutorial misconduct , and in her dissent she talks about that very clearly , that hiding evidence , exculpatory evidence , is certainly grounds when a person \u2019 s life is at stake , \u201d Lampkin said .\nThere are about 2,400 people on federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % of them are Black , according to the Death Penalty Information Center .\nSince 1989 , 73 Black men and a Black woman sentenced to death were later found to be wrongfully convicted \u2014

though an execution death date has not been scheduled , according to Ohio \u2019 s Department of Rehabilitation and Correction website .\n\u201c She hasn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where she stands on the death penalty , but I think that from this dissent , we can see where she is going \u2014 that she is going to point to the critical failures in the administration of criminal justice that have led to us putting to death so many people that could have been proven innocent or that could have had evidence that would have helped their case , \u201d Lampkin said .\nLast month , Jackson issued another dissent after the court decided not to stay the execution of Kevin Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a police officer in 2005 .\nJohnson \u2019 s attorneys argued that the original trial prosecutor had a bias against Black people accused of crimes and brought that bias into the courtroom for his case .\nEven though Johnson was executed on Nov. 29 , Jackson issued the moot record the next day to say the execution violated Johnson \u2019 s constitutional right to due process , according to the SCOTUSblog .\nSotomayor joined this dissent as well .\nCivil rights groups have pushed a voting rights lawsuit against Alabama , accusing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congressional district map written by the Republican-controlled legislature dilutes the voting power of Black residents , they say , by grouping them into one majority-Black district instead of two , in violation of the Voting Rights Act .\nIn the case , Merrill v. Milligan , the state argues that creating a map that consciously grants Black residents more power would violate the 14th Amendment \u2019 s \u201c race-neutral \u201d equal protection clause .\nJackson pushed back , giving a 537-word history lesson on the 14th Amendment to Alabama \u2019 s solicitor general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She argued that , based on historical documents , \u201c the entire point of the amendment was to secure rights of the freed former slaves , \u201d undermining the \u201c race-neutral \u201d argument .\n\u201c The record shows that the reason why the 14th Amendment was enacted was to give a constitutional foundation for that kind of effort , for the Civil Rights Act of 1866 , \u201d Jackson said , \u201c It was drafted to give a foundational \u2014 a constitutional foundation for a piece of legislation that was designed to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights equal to white citizens.\n\u201d Jackson \u2019 s explanation of the 14th Amendment is an example of issues where \u201c not only our political leadership , but our judicial leadership \u201d lack an understanding on \u201c how those issues affect Black people.\n\u201d The leader of Students for Fair Admissions brought lawsuits against Harvard University and the University of North Carolina , claiming that their admissions processes have committed civil rights violations for allegedly discriminating against Asian students .\nBoth cases made their way to the Supreme Court on Oct. 31 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s 6-3 conservative majority may end affirmative action \u2014 even though previous Supreme Courts have upheld its constitutionality .\n\u201c I think our Republican leadership is really interested in breaking down a lot of the protections that were afforded so that African Americans could have equal footing .\nWithout her voice , who do we have ?\nThat becomes the question , \u201d Lampkin said .\nJackson \u2014 a Harvard graduate whose term on the university \u2019 s board of overseers expired earlier this year \u2014 said during her confirmation hearing in March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguments in this case .\nSome have questioned the move , since justices Kagan and Kavanaugh also have previous ties to Harvard University and did not recuse themselves .\nBut in the North Carolina case , she challenged an attorney for Students for Fair Admissions on the notion that colleges were considering race alone in assessing candidates .\n\u201c As I read the record and understand their process , it \u2019 s never standing alone , that it \u2019 s in the context of all of the other factors .\nThere are 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the admissions office is looking at , \u201d she said .\n\u201c And you haven \u2019 t demonstrated or shown one situation in which all they look at is race and take from that stereotypes and other things .\nThey \u2019 re looking at the full person with all of these characteristics.\n\u201d Lampkin noted that Justices Sotomayor and Kagan have made cases for the benefits of diversity in education in the past , but Jackson put an especially sharp point on the issue .\n\u201c I think Justice Jackson is upholding something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is the benefit of diversity and education and also the understanding of equity in education and what this would do to unravel our colleges and universities , \u201d Lampkin said .\nIn the case of Lorie Smith , the Colorado creative web designer declined services to a same-sex couple , saying she should not have to compromise her religious beliefs and artistic creativity to run a business .\nSmith \u2019 s refusal of service to that same-sex couple violates Colorado law , which she \u2019 s challenging through the civil legal system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican-appointed panel of justices will set a precedent and side with her .\nDuring oral arguments on Dec. 5 , Jackson compared Smith \u2019 s case to a person hired to play Santa Claus at a mall who refused to take Christmas photographs with Black children .\nThe hypothetical prompted a counter-example from Justice Samuel Alito , who asked if a Black mall Santa would have to take a picture with a child in a Ku Klux Klan outfit .\nLampkin \u2019 s concern is that if the Republican-appointed bench sides with Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone who claims to be creative to deny services for any reason .\n\u201c There could be a severe limitation between private and public accessibility to services and resources that would color our country as intolerant , \u201d Lampkin said .\nBrooks says that this case symbolizes how \u201c we \u2019 re still trying to fight for equality in society , and the way that the law is used to help us fight for equality , we can \u2019 t do that if we \u2019 re on the defense .\nAnd all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the defensive and to gradually weaken us.\n\u201d \u201c We are not on the offense , the issues that we care about are not progressing in the courts , the legal theories that we believe should govern have no sunlight , because they \u2019 re on the offense by virtue of their 6-3 majority and the way that the legal community has said or treated that to guide its own strategies , \u201d Brooks said

prepare to crowd onto planes and gather at holiday dinner tables , overcrowded emergency rooms from Philadelphia to Los Angeles are grappling with hours-long wait times and record-high patient admissions .\nThe rush has been largely fueled by the triple threat of COVID-19 , RSV , and influenza , a brutal combination of respiratory illnesses that have surged all at once .\nSome state and local officials have issued emergency orders to assist their overwhelmed medical systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatments .\n\u201c The past several years have certainly not been easy , and now we face another surge of illness , \u201d said Dr. Rochelle Walensky , director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , during a media briefing in early December .\n\u201c Another moment of overstretched capacity , and really one of tragic and often preventable sadness.\n\u201d Influenza and RSV struck harder and earlier this year , emerging months before their typical start in October .\nNow , nearly every state is reporting \u201c high \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMore than 25,900 patients were hospitalized due to the virus last week , making it one of the worst seasons for the respiratory illness in the last decade , according to CDC data .\nRSV hospitalizations have declined from last month \u2019 s peak , but also remain well above previous years .\nMeanwhile , COVID-19 case numbers are experiencing the annual holiday-season jump , though cases and deaths remain significantly lower than the past two winters .\nThe COVID-19 virus hit Black Americans particularly hard , and as the pandemic continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nRacial disparities also are seen in flu infections , with Black Americans hospitalized at about three times the rate of white Americans .\nAnd research has shown that Black children are more likely to be hospitalized for RSV than white children , as well .\nHere \u2019 s what you need to know about the \u201c tripledemic \u201d to help keep your family safe ahead of your holiday travel .\nWhat is respiratory syncytial virus , or RSV ?\nRSV , or respiratory syncytial virus , is a common respiratory virus that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for young children , it is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia , which may require hospitalization for the most severe infections .\nThis year , it has overwhelmed many children \u2019 s hospitals nationwide .\nPremature babies and those born with weakened immune systems or chronic lung disease are most at risk .\nAcross the country , an estimated 58,000 to 80,000 children younger than 5 years old are hospitalized each year , according to the CDC .\nSimilarly , those over the age of 65 with preexisting conditions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nYou may be contagious a day or two before you start showing signs of RSV infection .\nWhat is the difference between RSV , COVID-19 , the flu , and a common cold ?\nThe three viruses are transmitted in similar ways .\nThe coronavirus is transmitted through prolonged close contact with an infected person .\nRSV and the flu are transmitted through droplets in an infected person \u2019 s cough or sneeze , as well as direct contact with the virus on surfaces .\nMany symptoms of the flu , COVID-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat , cough , fever , and fatigue are all common .\nThere are some differences , however .\nWhile sneezing is common with RSV , it happens only occasionally with the coronavirus and is unlikely a symptom of the flu .\nAches are rarely a symptom of RSV and are sometimes a symptom of COVID-19 , but they are common with the flu .\nFlu symptoms tend to run their course within one to two weeks , while COVID-19 symptoms may last longer .\nRSV symptoms typically improve within a week \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend attempting to self-diagnose or dismiss symptoms .\n\u201c The best thing to do is go and get tested , \u201d said Natasha Williams , an associate professor of population health at New York University .\n\u201c If you can , talk with a medical provider.\n\u201d How do I get tested for RSV , COVID-19 , and the flu ?\nSome pharmacies , like CVS , offer in-person testing for the coronavirus and flu , which consists of swabbing the nose or throat .\nMany hospital providers and urgent care centers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFor RSV , a health care provider can administer the test , which includes either a nasal wash or swab .\nTesting as early as possible is recommended , said Williams .\nThere are safe and effective treatments that can be administered in the first few days of COVID-19 and flu infections that can protect patients from the most severe illness .\nPaxlovid is an antiviral drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use among patients who had tested positive for the coronavirus , are over 65 years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase the likelihood of severe infection , such as diabetes or cancer .\nIt may also reduce the risk of long COVID .\nThe drug must be started within five days of symptom onset to be effective .\nAs many prepare to gather with family this winter , many of the same safety precautions put into place over the past three years will protect those most vulnerable from each of the viruses , health experts say .\n\u201c The recommendations from early on in the pandemic still are effective , and that includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spaces where there is poor ventilation , testing , and the vaccine , \u201d said Williams .\nMasking is particularly important for those living in high transmission areas for COVID-19 , which includes just under 10 % of the U.S. population .\nA number of localities across the country are issuing new mask mandates as case numbers increase , including counties in California and New York .\nAnd with an earlier and more harsh flu season this year , the CDC recommends that everyone over 6 months old get a flu vaccine if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no vaccine currently available for RSV , although there are some in development .\nPfizer \u2019 s vaccine for older adults is awaiting FDA approval .\nTraditional public health methods also help in slowing the spread of germs .\nThose include frequent handwashing and use of hand sanitizer ; keeping your hands off of your eyes , nose , and mouth ; avoiding close contact with sick people ; covering coughs and sneezes ; and disinfecting surfaces often .\nIf you are feeling sick , stay home from work and school , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others .\nIs it too late for the flu shot ?\nAlthough winter has already begun , it is not too late to be vaccinated this season , said Williams .\n\u201c People should still consider getting the flu vaccine .\nIt is highly recommended.\n\u201d Last year , 42 % of Black Americans were vaccinated against the flu , compared with more than 50 % of white Americans , CDC data shows .\nIt \u2019 s an inequity that may be one of the driving forces behind the racial disparities in hospitalizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the age of 5 or over 65 and those who are pregnant or have underlying conditions .\nThose are the groups that tend to be hospitalized , said Walensky with the CDC .\nYou can get a flu shot and COVID-19 booster administered in the same visit , so long as you are due for both .\nHow do I know if I am in a high transmission area for COVID ?\nThe CDC \u2019 s COVID-19 Community Levels are determined based on the number of new cases and new hospital admissions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hospital beds in use by patients infected with the virus in a specific county over the past seven days .\nA number of counties scattered across the country are currently designated as high transmission areas .\nAbout 10 % of the population is living in a high transmission area , which includes counties in Arizona , California , New Mexico , and

following a verbal altercation with her professor has reignited debate about the use of law enforcement in education and has some people wondering : Where are Black students safe ?\nPolice at Winston-Salem State University arrested the student in front of her class Wednesday morning after receiving a call from a university employee about a disturbance inside a classroom .\nThe student , Leilla Hamoud , was later charged with misdemeanor disorderly conduct .\nHamoud said in an Instagram Live post that the incident with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a disagreement over an assignment and escalated to yelling when the professor ordered her to redo it .\nHamoud said Villagomez told her to leave the classroom , but Hamoud refused because she was supposed to present a group project .\nIn

with law enforcement procedures \u201d the officers decided to remove the student from the classroom to ensure safety .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ police is a prevalent problem in our community ; however , that is not what happened in this incident , \u201d Robinson said .\nBut many students have adamantly disagreed , calling the chancellor \u2019 s statement \u201c a slap in the face \u201d and saying the incident has left them feeling unsafe on campus .\n\u201c You have these police officers being aggressive with Leila like she threatened someone or physically harmed the teacher , when Leila \u2019 s at the back of the classroom and the teacher \u2019 s at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student told local news station WXII .\n\u201c The white officer did hear Leila telling him , \u2018 You \u2019 re hurting me.\n\u2019 And even I could see how far up her arm was twisted .\nI thought he was going to break her arm.\n\u201d The use of law enforcement in schools has been a hot-button issue .\nSupporters say school police are necessary to keep students safe , but others criticize their presence for criminalizing Black children and fueling the school-to-prison pipeline .\nStudents as young as 6 years old @

only representing 15 % of the student population , Black students made up nearly 32 % of those arrested during the 2017-2018 school year .\nThey made up 29 % of those referred to law enforcement , according to the report .\nSome incidents have been captured on video , but it has been rare to see in-classroom arrests at the college level , and almost unheard of at HBCUs .\n\u201c It \u2019 s sad enough when we see these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black , you know , shopping while Black , going to the park while Black , selling Girl Scout cookies while Black , \u201d said Gloria Browne-Marshall , a

administration of an HBCU allow Black students to have the threat of arrest over their heads while earning an education , Browne-Marshall said .\nCriminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as disorderly conduct , can set off a firestorm of issues for the person accused .\nWith all that Black Americans have had to overcome to get an education , the footage of Hamoud \u2019 s arrest is an understandable trigger , said Keith Taylor , an adjunct assistant professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice , but it doesn \u2019 t provide all the information needed to conclude that anyone acted wrongfully .\n\u201c We can relate to things that we see that appear to reflect our history and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes what we see is not actually what happened , \u201d Taylor said .\nAccording to the university \u2019 s policies and regulations for students , faculty members can ask the disruptive student to leave the classroom so the lesson can continue for the other students , but if the student

: What is that massive 20-foot-tall pump next to our house ?\n\u201c I always think about when I first saw the pump , because I thought it was just something that happened in that movie , \u2018 The Beverly Hillbillies , \u2019 \u201d Gibbs remembered , referencing a 1960s TV show and 1993 film about a poor rural family that moves to the upscale California city after oil was discovered on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bobbing heads of oil pump jacks can be seen in the midst of many residential neighborhoods across America \u2019 s second-largest city .\nThey tower near parks where children play and along the sides of busy streets .\nContrary to Gibbs \u2019 childhood belief and popular understanding , LA is home to the largest urban network of oil and gas production in the U.S .\nBut that will soon change .\nIn a unanimous decision this month , the Los Angeles City Council voted to ban the creation of any new oil wells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next 20 years .\nThe move comes on the heels of a city ban on gas stoves in new residential and commercial buildings and a state law that requires all vehicles sold in California to be electric by 2035 .\nThe changes are an effort to accelerate the country \u2019 s shift toward clean energy , a commitment that will come at the expense of a massive source of revenue .\nFrom an environmental and health perspective , the shift will disproportionately benefit Black and Latino Angelenos .\nAcross the city , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas wells , and predominantly Black and Latino communities are home to a higher concentration of them compared to majority-white areas .\nThe Gibbs \u2019 family home , located in a neighborhood that has a Black population four times larger than the city \u2019 s average , sits on top of the third-largest oil field in the U.S. A 2022 study by researchers at the University of California , Berkeley , found that the disparities in communities of color are not coincidental .\nFormerly redlined communities , created to enforce segregation and relegate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are home to roughly twice as many oil and gas drilling sites as non-redlined , predominantly white communities .\nThe practice continues to disproportionately harm Black residents in other places , such as Kansas City , Missouri , and some cities with large Black populations , like Akron and Youngstown , Ohio , are even poised to expand the practice .\nMore than 1 million Black Americans are exposed to the invisible forms of pollution from oil drilling , including noise , air , and water pollution .\nLiving near oil and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher rates of cancer , heart disease , severe respiratory illnesses , and depression .\nIt also contributes to a significant health impact affecting Black communities : maternal health .\nProximity to oil and gas wells is linked to birth complications , including preterm births , neural tube defects , and adverse reproductive outcomes , such as increased maternal mortality rates .\nThe decision to ban the long-standing practice is largely due to more than 25 years of community organizing , including a decade-long campaign from the STAND L.A. coalition , a collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environmental justice organizations .\nThe state \u2019 s oil industry , which has lobbied against the move for years , claims the action will erase a $ 250 million industry in LA , while negatively impacting 8,000 jobs associated with oil extraction and leaving the state more dependent on imported foreign oil .\nIn October , the California Independent Petroleum Association , representing more than 300 oil and gas companies , wrote a letter to the LA City Council disputing claims of \u201c detrimental health effects \u201d from oil and gas drilling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community organizers , pointing to multiple studies showing the impacts of oil drilling on human health and the environment , have also highlighted analyses that show a national clean energy transition would create millions of jobs .\nMany questions about the city \u2019 s ban remain unanswered , however , including detailed timelines of each drilling site \u2019 s closure , how land ownership rights will be handled , and , most notably for residents , how oil companies will ensure the proper capping of oil wells .\nThere are more than 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. , which are collectively responsible for emitting 281,000 tons of methane into the atmosphere every year , a 2020 Reuters investigation found .\nMore than 25 % of California \u2019 s methane emissions come from leaking oil wells , a 2019 study found .\nMethane \u2014 the second-largest contributor to climate change \u2014 warms the planet by 86 times as much as carbon dioxide .\nLast week , Capital B traveled through LA \u2019 s Black neighborhoods that are home to oil drilling to speak to residents about their experiences living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the phasing-out process , and what they want to see replace these sites in the future .\nVictoria Richardson \u2019 s intimate relationship with oil drilling began in 1997 when she moved to her home in LA \u2019 s Harbor Gateway North neighborhood , which is 45 % Black .\nThe oil well operating next door became quite a nuisance .\nAt one point , heaps of oil poured over her yard from the drill site , ruining her furniture .\nRichardson says she was compensated for the damages , but some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site are hard to put a dollar figure on .\n\u201c At the beginning , there were a lot of rats that infested my home from the oil field , \u201d she told Capital B as the oil pump dipped up and down beside her home .\n\u201c The other major problem was the noise , \u201d she said .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve gotten accustomed to it now , but I still don \u2019 t open my windows at times because it \u2019 s so loud and the smell can be potent.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ impacts of oil drilling on human health , she has begun connecting the dots to her own life .\nRichardson , who has heart murmurs , and her husband regularly experience lightheadedness when the operator removes oil from the site .\n\u201c Living here , there are things that you just don \u2019 t think about , so it becomes normal , but it \u2019 s really not , \u201d she said , referring to her neighborhood \u2019 s high concentration of oil wells .\n\u201c It \u2019 s an impact every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it.\n\u201d Looking toward the future , Richardson hopes that the city creates community meetings for residents so they can remain updated on the phasing-out process , with an emphasis on safeguarding current residents from any increased pollution if oil companies attempt to ramp up production before they \u2019 re forced to close wells for good .\nOnce the oil wells are closed , she wouldn \u2019 t oppose developers building new homes on the land because of the city \u2019 s housing and homelessness issues .\nAs a child , Dominic Gibbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said .\nHe lives in LA \u2019 s harbor area , home to the highest concentration of oil refineries west of Texas and the largest port in North America .\nBehind his home are railroad tracks that carry dozens of trains to and from the port every week , including oil trains .\nAt one point , there were more than 60 active oil wells in the half-square-mile community .\nToday , there are roughly two dozen , as oil pumps in the neighborhood have slowly been capped and idled over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , the oil well beside his home was decommissioned , opening up a number of plans for his family .\nGibbs said they have dreamed about buying the land around the idled oil well to extend the property for extended family .\nHe would also love to see a community park for the neighborhood \u2019 s children or apartments to help tackle the area \u2019 s homelessness problems .\n\u201c I feel like we deserve something here for all of us , \u201d he said .\n\u201c Something for the greater good.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned about the potential impacts of leaks on his community throughout the phasing-out process .\nAn investigation by the FracTracker Alliance , an environmental organization , found that two idled oil wells in his neighborhood were leaking methane in August .\n\u201c We live here , and we \u2019 re so impacted , so we deserve to be included , especially if there was an instance where methane or something was leaking into the air that could be problematic for us .\n\u201d", "author": "Adam Mahoney", "url": "https://capitalbnews.org/oil-drilling-ban-la/", "published": "Tue, 20 Dec 2022 19:00:00 +0000", "published_utc":

Lee Merritt said during a press conference with the family Tuesday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment in the city of Fort Worth and for Tarrant County.\n\u201d It was the latest conviction of a law enforcement officer accused of using excessive violence that led to the death of a Black citizen .\nSince 2005 , 171 nonfederal officers have been arrested on murder or manslaughter charges in connection to an on-duty shooting of a civilian as of Dec. 1 , according to Philip M. Stinson , a criminal justice professor with Bowling Green State University .\nOf those 171 officers , only 54 have been convicted of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said \u2014 21 by guilty plea , 32 by jury trial , and 1 by bench trial .\nStinson \u2019 s data shows a gradual increase in the number of officers charged annually for on-duty killings , peaking with 21 in 2021 .\nHe counts 19 so far in 2022 , noting that , in recent years , sometimes multiple officers have been charged for a single incident .\nAs in Dean \u2019 s case , the charges have often relied on video footage or a fellow officer \u2019 s testimony that contradicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or questions their adherence to protocol .\nThe rapid proliferation of video evidence \u2014 whether cellphone video , body camera footage , dash-cams , or surveillance images \u2014 has disabled prosecutors \u2019 ability to turn a blind eye to fatal police encounters .\nHundreds of millions of people have been able to see the homicides of Black Americans at the hands of law enforcement in recent years , altering public perceptions of police credibility and what constitutes an injustice , experts say .\n\u201c With more exposure , more technology , more evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosecuted , it starts to open the eyes of the general public to say , \u2018 You know what ?\nWe aren \u2019 t going to believe [ the police ] , we are going to thoroughly investigate them , \u2019 \u201d said Joshua Byrd , program chair and professor of criminal justice with the American InterContinental University-Atlanta Campus .\nBlack chief prosecutors have been particularly responsible for the increase in police accountability .\nOf those 21 officers charged last year , most were pursued by chief prosecutors who are Black men or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Violence , a nonprofit , independent organization that collects and publishes police-violence data .\nWhile elected women of color prosecutors make up less than 2 % of the over 2,300 elected prosecutors across the U.S. , the report found that Black women elected prosecutors were accountable for \u201c 20 % of prosecutors charging officers in two or more deadly force incidents from 2013-2021.\n\u201d Still , with at least 1,000 homicides by police each year rarely result in charges , according to Mapping Police Violence .\nEven when prosecutors initiate an investigation into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be politically risky , Byrd said .\nWhile law enforcement has been key in calling out fellow officers \u2019 problematic behavior in certain high-profile cases , including the deaths of Jefferson and George Floyd , it remains a difficult wall to break .\n\u201c Prosecutors are up against this blue wall of silence that even when they bring charges , some prosecutors are up against some officers who don \u2019 t even want to testify , \u201d Byrd said .\nAlso , video evidence can be called into question .\nMany bystanders who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the midst of an interaction \u2014 very few videos capture the moment in its entirety .\n\u201c Technology is such a double-edged sword for some communities , \u201d said Christina Greer , an associate professor of political science at Fordham University , adding , \u201c Because on one hand , people feel like technology overpolices them and they are hyper-surveilled .\nBut then on the other hand , technology is the only reason why we know half of this stuff is going on .\nBut we also know that a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u2018 Well yes , I know on camera it shows me beating the living daylights out of this person , but you didn \u2019 t see what happened beforehand.\n\u2019 So now the goalpost keeps moving.\n\u201d The road to true justice remains long , advocates say , and doesn \u2019 t end with the growing public support for prosecuting police officers .\nAccording to a study conducted by the Gallup Center on Black Voices earlier this year , 72 % of Black Americans polled said that \u201c major changes are needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there \u2019 s a deeper , I think , engagement that has to be had about how we prevent these kinds of incidents from happening as opposed to just exposing them when they do happen , \u201d said the Rev .\nMarkel Hutchins , CEO of MovementForward , a faith-based , nonprofit social justice organization that aims , in part , to bridge the gap between the community and law enforcement through human engagement programs .\n\u201c I am of the belief that we can not arrest police officers enough to cause there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the culture in law enforcement.\n\u201d Several cases involving fatal encounters with police could see arrests or trials in the coming months .\nHere are a few that Capital B will be keeping an eye on in 2023 : \u2022 Five Louisiana state troopers were indicted this month in the 2019 death of Ronald Greene , 49 .\nThe troopers were placed on administrative leave following the indictment announcement on Dec. 16 .\nPolice told Greene \u2019 s family that Greene died after crashing his car into a tree , but body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during which officers beat and dragged Greene .\nOne officer was hit with homicide-related charges , while the others face obstruction of justice and malfeasance in office charges .\nThe Justice Department has two pending investigations in connection to Greene \u2019 s death that includes a pattern or practice probe in the Louisiana State Police .\nAt least one of the officers charged has been released on bail and is expected in court for arraignment in February 2023 .\n\u2022 Jaheim McMillan was a 15-year-old Gulfport , Mississippi , student who was fatally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a police officer who was responding to a call of teenagers waving firearms at passing cars .\nMcMillan \u2019 s family and bystanders have contested police accounts , saying McMillan was unarmed and had his hands up before the officer shot him .\nAdvocates have called on Family Dollar to release unedited surveillance footage from outside the store where he was killed .\nThe incident is still being investigated by Gulfport Police Department and the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation .\n\u2022 A former police officer in Grand Rapids , Michigan , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patrick Lyoya , a refugee from Congo .\nChristopher Schurr pulled over Lyoya in April for faulty license plates , an encounter that escalated to a struggle over Schurr \u2019 s Taser .\nSchurr shot Lyoya in the back of the head , a series of events captured on body camera and dash camera footage .\nSchurr , who was fired , has pleaded not guilty and is expected to go to trial , but a date has not been set .\n\u2022 Five New Haven , Connecticut , police officers were charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrest that left him paralyzed from the chest down .\nCox was handcuffed and placed into the back of a police van when the driver made an abrupt stop that caused him to slide head first into the back door , according to surveillance video from the vehicle .\nThe 36-year-old was arrested in June and accused of possessing an illegal handgun .\nThe officers were charged with second-degree reckless endangerment .\nThey \u2019 re expected in court on Jan. 11 for arraignment .\n\u2022 Three Camden County , Georgia , police officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violating their oath of office after surveillance video showed Jarrett Hobbs being brutally beaten , according to a

forgiveness program created for farmers of color .\nThe lawsuit stalled payment distribution to Black recipients and pushed the Biden administration to replace the race-conscious program \u2014 created to address past discrimination by the USDA \u2014 with a race-neutral version .\nBlack farmers who were promised relief never received it .\n\u201c It \u2019 s almost like 40 acres and a mule .\nJust another empty promise for Black people , \u201d John Boyd Jr. , president of the National Black Farmers Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Capital B in August .\nBoyd is now one of four farmers of color who have filed their own lawsuit against the U.S. government in response to the program \u2019 s demise , saying the feds broke their agreement .\nThe legal battle is an example of the tension between government efforts to repair past racial discrimination while also upholding a lofty notion of \u201c race neutrality.\n\u201d The problem has crept up again in President Joe Biden \u2019 s landmark Inflation Reduction Act , which includes a massive $ 19 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean energy and other climate-friendly agricultural practices , as well as improve their land \u2019 s environmental conservation .\nThe cash is being funneled into four popular but long under-funded programs administered by the USDA , with an assumption that the dollars will be distributed equitably .\nBut there \u2019 s no way to assure that Black farmers are getting their fair share .\nDespite the USDA \u2019 s long , documented history of racism , the application distributed by the Natural Resource Conservation Service \u2014 the department that administers the four programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identifying recipients \u2019 race , ethnicity , or gender , making it impossible to track whether the resources are helping Black farmers as much as white farmers .\nUSDA policy requires that all departments provide a separate form to farmers and producers to submit their demographic information , but applicants don \u2019 t have to fill it out .\nIn the past , USDA employees would independently fill in the applicant \u2019 s race if they had an idea .\nBut now , the agency declares the race of the applicant as \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spokesperson said .\nAs a result , there is no way of knowing whether Black farmers will equally benefit from the largest climate investment in U.S. history .\nAnd there \u2019 s reason to suspect that , without targeted programs , they won \u2019 t .\nBetween 1910 and 2007 , the USDA denied loans to women and people of color at higher rates than it did to white men , which contributed to billions of dollars in land loss .\nIn 2021 , 42 % of Black farmers were denied USDA loans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of white farmers , according to an analysis by CNN .\nIn an effort to be more inclusive , the NRCS is asking for public comment on how to distribute the funds from the Inflation Reduction Act and expand program access , especially for underserved farmers .\nOf the more than 150 comments received so far , a few have implored the agency to prioritize more small-scale producers and landowners , specifically Black people .\n\u201c A lot of government programs are not addressing the economic wealth gap and generational post-traumatic experiences and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crow laws , lynchings , civil rights and oppression , \u201d one comment said .\n\u201c Black Americans have made the most contributions to this country for free for a great period of time .\nNow is the time for the government to acknowledge and address the unfairness of this government.\n\u201d Consistent and reliable data about race and ethnicity is necessary to eliminate such disparities , experts say .\nThat falls not only on agencies that collect the data \u2014 it \u2019 s also important for individuals to self-disclose , said Erika @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of African Americans in Human Resources .\nBecause of the nation \u2019 s long history of racism , some people of color are reluctant to submit certain self-identifying information out of concern that they may be discriminated against , she added .\nA 2016 study found that people of color who removed references to their race from their resumes or job applications received higher chances of being considered for job interviews .\n\u201c You never know who \u2019 s on the other side of that application that has any type of unconscious bias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people , \u201d Broadwater said .\nBut providing racial information can be beneficial .\nUnlike the NRCS , the USDA \u2019 s Farm Service Agency loan application includes a race box .\nAlthough individuals aren \u2019 t required to provide their race , \u201c failure to provide this information may result in not receiving targeted funds for which the applicant may be eligible .\nThis information will not be used to evaluate this application , \u201d according to the application package .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a two-edged sword .\nYou \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re still darned if you don \u2019 t , \u201d Broadwater said .\nShe added that accountability measures are needed to ensure that those awarding grants , federal funding , or job or business opportunities are held accountable for ensuring equity .\n\u201c When you think about it from all lenses , there \u2019 s never a good outcome until there is some type of legislation that universally prohibits these types of discriminations.\n\u201d But there can be wide differences in how laws prohibiting racial discrimination are interpreted .\nCurrently , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the application of the 14th Amendment , ratified after the Civil War to ensure citizenship protections for Black people .\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted the 14th Amendment \u2019 s equal protection clause , which requires states to equally apply laws to all people , to mean that states can not use a person \u2019 s race to benefit them , said attorney Augustus Corbett .\nThat interpretation gives white conservatives ammunition to argue that programs seeking to repair past discrimination against people of color , such as affirmative action , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c By claiming and interpreting the laws as race-neutral , the very laws that were intended to help African Americans , they end up not helping African Americans , \u201d Corbett said .\nAs an example , Corbett pointed to Biden \u2019 s original $ 4 billion loan program and the class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of white farmers who argued that , by rectifying past discrimination against Black farmers , the program discriminated against them .\nThat program was replaced by one that removes race and offers assistance to a broader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ USDA never sent aid to the Black farmers who applied for the original program .\nAs a result , they can \u2019 t pay off their debts , according to the class-action lawsuit filed by Black farmers in October , and are at risk of \u201c losing their farms and their livelihoods as a result of the U.S. Government \u2019 s wrongful conduct.\n\u201d Lester Bonner , one of the plaintiffs , is already in foreclosure proceedings .", "author":

that they would not vote for the bond for the school \u2019 s capital improvements unless they did something about the overpopulation that many of them were attributing to our desegregation order .\nAt the time , the president of the school board was the former principal of my high school , and he tried to convince me to be the face of reversing this policy .\nHe said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , you

is the perfect place to \u201c bring us together \u201d because everyone wants clean and affordable energy and water .\nCan you share how a public service commissioner works to do that ?\nOur public service commissioners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , water , broadband , and telecommunication , but it also included trucking and railroads at one point in time .\nIn Louisiana , we are probably the most powerful utility commission simply because we are elected and only a few states elect utility commissioners .\nWe are a constitutionally created body of the executive branch , meaning the legislature can not constitutionally govern us , so it puts a lot of power in our hands .\nWe \u2019 re constantly regulating out monopoly .\nWe are talking about the push for renewable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create .\nI strongly believe that utilities are a human right and that access to fresh air , clean water , a cool house in the summer , and a warm house in the winter should be counted as a right .\nAs a public service

commission .\nWhat do you think are the values and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Louisiana in that regard ?\nI think the value of it is that the appointment process can be convoluted .\nIn some states , they \u2019 re appointed by the governor , and in other states are appointed by the legislature , so it keeps it very insular and out of the public eye .\nThe beauty of having an election system is that ,

?\nLouisiana is ground zero when it comes to environmental justice and climate change .\nWe are right off the Gulf and very much prone to hurricanes that are getting stronger , and we know the oil and

depend on fossil fuels and not using renewable energy .\nSo for me , the shift is about the health of our state \u2019 s economy , people , and power grid .\nAs you mentioned , across the country , Black residents are paying more for energy despite being more energy efficient than white residents .\nWhat will be the impact of lowering that energy payment gap ?\nAbsolutely .\nI think one @ @ @ @

debate about whether or not people can afford to put food on their table and whether they keep the lights on .\nJust a few days ago , in New Orleans , we lost a 73-year-old woman whose house caught on fire because she had to create a makeshift heater in her home because her utilities were cut off for nonpayment .\nThat \u2019 s disastrous .\nFor me , I think about our energy and economic system as a way that shows how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plantation slave mentality , how much of that rooted white supremacy and racism still exist , and how it is intertwined into our environmental and climate

.\nOverall , about two-thirds of all U.S. adults say clinical trials are very important .\nBut the responses from Black people interviewed for the report shows that whether clinical trials are

@ @ @ @ native to learn more about his goals , what drives his passions , and why Louisiana is \u201c ground zero \u201d for climate and environmental justice .\nCapital B : I always love to start at the beginning ; there are always pivotal moments that bring people into public service .\nWhat was that moment for you ?\nDavante Lewis : I really had my moment bringing me to public service as a high school student .\nMy school had become overpopulated and needed some serious capital improvements .\nThey needed to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but my school was on the white side of the city .\nSo there was a lot of angst among property owners that they would not vote for the bond for the school \u2019 s capital improvements unless they did something about the overpopulation that many of them were attributing to our desegregation order .\nAt the time , the president of the school board was the former principal of my high school , and he tried to convince me to be the face of reversing this policy .\nHe said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , you would have been an exception to the rule because you are needed here at this school.\n\u201d And I took real offense to that .\nI said , Well , what about my sister ?\nWhat about my cousins ?\nHe goes , \u201c Well , you know what ?\nDavante , if you care so much , you know so much about things .\nWhy don \u2019 t you make the rules ?\n\u201d You are the first openly LGBTQ politician elected to a state-level office , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any office in state history .\nThat is mind-boggling to hear in 2022 .\nWhat reaction do you feel when you hear that fact ?\nI \u2019 ve always said our diversity is our strength and our experiences should be valued , but my campaign wasn \u2019 t really rooted in those experiences .\nMy point is I want to be at the table in an inclusive way and not at the table because I \u2019 m a diversity choice .\nI \u2019 m hoping my win showcases that you can win when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the things that really bring us together .\nI \u2019 m not trying to lessen the movement or the moment , but I also wanted to share that it wasn \u2019 t central to my campaign .\nIt wasn \u2019 t a hidden fact , either .\nTo your point , the Public Service Commission is the perfect place to \u201c bring us together \u201d because everyone wants clean and affordable energy and water .\nCan you share how a public service commissioner works to do that ?\nOur public service commissioners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , water , broadband , and telecommunication , but it also included trucking and railroads at one point in time .\nIn Louisiana , we are probably the most powerful utility commission simply because we are elected and only a few states elect utility commissioners .\nWe are a constitutionally created body of the executive branch , meaning the legislature can not constitutionally govern us , so it puts a lot of power in our hands .\nWe \u2019 re constantly regulating out monopoly .\nWe are talking about the push for renewable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create .\nI strongly believe that utilities are a human right and that access to fresh air , clean water , a cool house in the summer , and a warm house in the winter should be counted as a right .\nAs a public service commissioner , I get to help make that a reality .\nOne of the issues that was at the center of your election cycle was the idea of corruption and energy companies basically buying support from the commission .\nWhat do you think are the values and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Louisiana in that regard ?\nI think the value of it is that the appointment process can be convoluted .\nIn some states , they \u2019 re appointed by the governor , and in other states are appointed by the legislature , so it keeps it very insular and out of the public eye .\nThe beauty of having an election system is that , as I said , I strongly believe that utilities are a human right , and being accountable to voters allows us to put these issues at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most people don \u2019 t know anything about what a utility regulator does .\nIt \u2019 s not as [ personal ] as electing your mayor or your senator that you can directly see the benefits from , which means a lot of the campaign contributions at this point typically come from the entities who have stakes in the regulation world .\nSo the downside is for most elections , excluding mine , whoever utility companies have backed behind typically wins the election .\nYou \u2019 ve mentioned how utilities are a human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance behind accelerating Louisiana \u2019 s clean energy production to help solidify some of those rights ?\nLouisiana is ground zero when it comes to environmental justice and climate change .\nWe are right off the Gulf and very much prone to hurricanes that are getting stronger , and we know the oil and gas industry that has been the bulk of Louisiana for so long is contributing to that .\nSo when we think about the transition to clean energy , most importantly now , it is cheaper to get your energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the end , it \u2019 s also healthier .\nI will be representing a district that has been nicknamed worldwide as \u201c Cancer Alley \u201d because of our high cancer rates .\nIn my district , if you are Black , you are seven to 21 times more likely to be exposed to air pollution than any other place in our state .\nWe \u2019 re home to the most petrochemical plants in the nation .\nSo the Black and brown people that I represent deserve a change .\nThey deserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In my district , residents are paying 30 to 40 % more than the average Louisiana resident because we depend on fossil fuels and not using renewable energy .\nSo for me , the shift is about the health of our state \u2019 s economy , people , and power grid .\nAs you mentioned , across the country , Black residents are paying more for energy despite being more energy efficient than white residents .\nWhat will be the impact of lowering that energy payment gap ?\nAbsolutely .\nI think one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about more often is how intertwined economic justice and environmental justice are .\nWe know most petrochemical plants are located in Black and brown communities .\nWe know nuclear and wastewater plants are always more likely to be in a Black and brown area , and we know that is because of the economic status of Black and brown people .\nHalf of my district is one life circumstance away , one flat tire away , and one higher-than-normal electricity bill away from being pushed into deep poverty and homelessness .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate among climate professors ; this is a debate about whether or not people can afford to put food on their table and whether they keep the lights on .\nJust a few days ago , in New Orleans , we lost a 73-year-old woman whose house caught on fire because she had to create a makeshift heater in her home because her utilities were cut off for nonpayment .\nThat \u2019 s disastrous .\nFor me , I think about our energy and economic system as a way that shows how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plantation slave mentality , how much of that rooted white supremacy and racism still exist , and how it is intertwined into our environmental and climate policy .\nWith Louisiana being \u201c ground zero \u201d for climate and environmental justice , what would that energy shift in Louisiana mean for the rest of the country ?\nIf Louisiana can do it , so can everybody else .\nOur entire social and economic ecosystem is based on our environment : our sugar cane , our rice farms , our produce , our sports , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water is contaminated because we \u2019 re not using renewable energy and we still have oil spills , that \u2019 s our food , entertainment , and livelihoods being impacted .\nThe importance of us making this transition in Louisiana is that it \u2019 s a beacon of opportunity for other states .\nIt showcases that in the place that so many people are saying is the hardest place to make that transition , it is possible .", "author": "Adam Mahoney", "url": "https://capitalbnews.org/davante-lewis-qa/", "published": "Mon,
