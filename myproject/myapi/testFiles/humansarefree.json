COVID-19 injections , joined Infowars reporter Kristi Leigh to explain how he came to realize that the COVID pandemic is actually a mechanism of the Great Reset , the World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and depopulate the world .\n\u201c The other thing for me has been the personal journey of coming to terms with what the World Economic Forum really represents , \u201d Malone told Leigh on New Year \u2019 s Eve .\n\u201c And I really resisted that .\nPeople were initially coming to me talking about the \u2018 Great Reset.\n\u2019 And I was like that \u2019 s crazy talk .\nBut then it \u2019 s all documented .\nAnd then you see it being deployed.\n\u201d Malone went on to explain how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out its vision to use the COVID pandemic to reorganize society towards global communism .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a public document that clearly states everybody that \u2019 s in our little clique , our club , \u2018 these are the things that we will think , these are the things that we will say , this is how we will act , \u2019 \u201d Malone said .\n\u201c And that one was kind of the icing on the cake , \u201d he continued .\n\u201c There it is .\nThey \u2019 re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t hide it .\nThis is the vision .\nIt is a full-on globalist totalitarian vision with the money and control.\n\u201d Malone described how he had heard of the New World Order as a political science undergraduate in the 1980s , but never imagined it could actually be real .\n\u201c I had read books about transnationalism and the New World Order .\nI find that fascinating , but confusing .\nHow could this possibly happen ?\n\u201d Dr. Malone asked .\n\u201c And now to see it playing out in real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which national sovereignty , governments , are increasingly irrelevant .\nThat \u2019 s the thing folks got to wake up about .\nThis is not about a vaccine .\nThe vaccine is a symptom.\n\u201d Ten minutes into the interview , Malone broke down his realization that the corporate press and global institutions were waging \u201c Orwellian \u201d information warfare against the people , culminating in his ban on Twitter for sharing scientific COVID data .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve been on the inside for so long , and seen [ NIAID director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long\u2026 so I saw the hardball politics , \u201d Malone said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not that haven \u2019 t been aware of that .\nBut I had not been aware before of the information control that is globally coordinated.\n\u201d \u201c We are seeing full-on Orwellian Ministry of Truth now , \u201d he continued .\n\u201c There \u2019 s no holds barred .\nIt doesn \u2019 t matter whether you cite the literature and you provide them with facts .\nThey are not about the facts .\nThis is full-on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warfare 21st century like we \u2019 ve never seen before , and coordinated globally , \u201d he added .\nMalone cited the media \u2019 s doom and gloom propaganda coverage of the Omicron variant as the latest example of media warfare deployed for governments to justify renewing COVID emergency powers .\n\u201c When you see that kind of coordinated behavior , folks like you and me say to ourselves , \u2018 what \u2019 s going on here ?\nWhy are they suddenly pushing the fear porn about Omicron , when Omicron is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths worldwide from Omicron .\nWhy is that ?\n\u201d he asked .\n\u201c The two-year declaration of emergency expires on January 15 , \u201d he noted .\n\u201c And if it \u2019 s allowed to expire and it \u2019 s not renewed , then the legal basis for all the Emergency Use

pandemic , the authoritarianism currently unfolding in front of us was easily predictable .\nIn fact , in March of 2020 , TFTP predicted mandatory injections , the police state , and travel restrictions .\nThis doesn \u2019 t make us special or psychic , it is easy to deduce once you realize the nature of the state and their tendency to use the only tool in their toolbox to tackle problems faced by society .\nThat sole tool is force .\nWhile the intentions of the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to prevent transmission of the virus , thanks to their tendency to use force without question , their noble intentions quickly became a conduit for tyrants to usurp your freedoms .\n\u201c Give us your freedom , and we will make the pandemic go away , \u201d was the mantra of team lockdown and , despite completely eroding what little freedom Americans had left , we are seeing yet another large spike in cases and hospitalizations .\nOne need only look at Australia and the sheer Nazi-esque approach they took to covid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state can stop a virus .\nOver the last year , Australia has beaten , kidnapped , arrested , and harassed anyone who didn \u2019 t toe the line and submit to their authority .\nA few months ago , they even began kidnapping completely healthy people and locking them up in internment camps for merely being exposed to someone who may have been positive with covid .\nThe country has fallen .\nEveryone was locked down and everyone was vaccinated , yet covid did what covid does .\nDespite becoming one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in regards to the pandemic , Australia is seeing its largest spike of cases since the covid hysteria began .\nOn top of the loss of economic and physical freedom , governments across the planet also took to attacking your medical freedom .\nPoliticians once again grabbed their only tool in the toolbox and began forcing people to take the jab \u2014 informed consent be damned .\nPeople were forced out of their jobs

Maddox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back her up \u2014 that the vaccine will keep you safe from getting covid .\n\u201c Now we know that the vaccines work well enough that the virus stops with every vaccinated person\u2026 A vaccinated person gets infected with the virus\u2026 the virus does not infect them\u2026the virus then can not \u2026 use a vaccinated person as a host to get more people.\n\u201d It wasn \u2019 t just Maddow either .\nFrom Bill Gates to Fauci to the president himself , these people took to their pulpits to spread a false narrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its tracks .\nSpoiler alert : it did not .\nAlso , remember the mantra repeated by corporate media and the US government ad nauseum , about the \u201c pandemic of the unvaccinated , \u201d which the White House COVID-19 Response Team introduced in mid-July , and which the president was still regurgitating inaccurately as late as December 14 ?\nThat was also proven to be false as well , even The Atlantic admitted it .\nNow , as the

of the bag and people have had enough .\nNo amount of definitions can be changed , boosters mandated , or lockdowns enforced that can keep the establishment \u2019 s ship from sinking .\nSure , there are still fearful people locked away in their homes , paralyzed with fear because their leaders tell them to be scared .\nBut they are now the minority .\nIn many parts of the world , despite @ @ @ @

, the narrative around covid is collapsing .\nWe welcome this collapse with open arms .\nIt is high time we take \u201c normal \u201d back .\nThis virus is here , you will come into contact with it , and you need to make your own personal choices on how to deal with it .\nThe government has not and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from getting sick .\nThankfully , many people are starting to get it .\nAs more people

Director Rochelle Walensky admitted that their new policy is dependent on \u201c what we thought people would be able to tolerate.\n\u201d How much more are you going to tolerate ?", "author": "HAF",

Malone explained to Rogan how the German people in the 1920-30s during Adolf Hitler \u2019 s rise to power \u201c went barking mad \u201d from mass formation psychosis .\n\u201c When you have a society that has become decoupled from each other and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things don \u2019 t make sense .\nWe can \u2019 t understand it .\nAnd then their attention gets focused by a leader or series of events on one small point , just like hypnosis , \u201d Malone said .\n\u201c They literally become hypnotized and can be literally led anywhere.\n\u201d The Malone-Rogan interview , and subsequently

reliable sources.\n\u201d Turns out , the \u201c reliable sources \u201d Google is now referring for its top results included an obscure YouTube video of a blogger calling for Spotify to shut down Joe Rogan over his interview with Malone .\nCompare Google \u2019 s new results to the less politically motivated DuckDuckGo , which shows relevant search results , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page and other results clarifying the meaning of mass formation psychosis .\nLikewise , Microsoft \u2019 s Bing also offers more relevant results of mass formation psychosis compared to Google .\nMalone \u2019 s Substack page describes in more depth mass formation psychosis , also called \u201c crowd psychosis \u201d : \u201c The conditions to set up mass formation psychosis include lack of social connectedness and sensemaking as well as large amounts of latent anxiety and passive aggression .\nWhen people are inundated with a narrative that presents a plausible \u201c object of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , then many individuals group together to battle the object with a collective singlemindedness .\nThis allows people to stop focusing on their own problems , avoiding personal mental anguish .\nInstead , they focus all their thought and energy on this new object .\nAs mass formation progresses , the group becomes increasingly bonded and connected .\nTheir field of attention is narrowed and they become unable to consider alternative points of view .\nLeaders of the movement are revered , unable to do no wrong .\nLeft unabated , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will support a totalitarian governance structure capable of otherwise unthinkable atrocities in order to maintain compliance .\n( A note : mass formation is different from group think ) .\nThere are easy ways to fix group think by just bringing in dissenting voices and making sure you give them platforms .\nIt isn \u2019 t so easy with mass formation .\nEven when the narrative falls apart , cracks in the strategy clearly aren \u2019 t solving

\u201c Ted L. Gunderson and Associates , \u201d in Santa Monica .\nIn a 1995 conference in Dallas , Gunderson warned about the proliferation of secret Satanic groups , and the danger posed by the New World Order , a shadow government that controls the U.S. government .\nGunderson discovered that in the U.S. there is a secret widespread network of groups who kidnap children and infants , and subject them to Satanic ritual abuse and subsequent human sacrifice .\nOne of those groups is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operated by the CIA .\nHe wrote a book on The Finders , which can still be downloaded from his website ( Ted Gunderson died in 2011 ) .\nThis is the same CIA group that the FBI just declassified many of the files from their investigation into The Finders , although many names remain redacted to protect the guilty .\n( See below . )\nGunderson traveled around the country giving lectures about his work , which included cases that led him to discover the hidden groups involved with the Satanic Occult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child sacrifice .\nHis general lecture was about 4 hours , but there is one lecture still available today where he condensed this down to just a little over one hour .\nAt the end of this lecture , Gunderson has a woman named Linda Weigand come up and give her testimony .\nAs he introduced her , Gunderson said : \u201c This is one of the most classic examples of corruption , I have ever seen .\nAnd believe me , you can tell from my lecture , that I \u2019 ve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d We have extracted Linda Weigand \u2019 s testimony from his lecture , but I have to warn you , this is very GRAPHIC , and very evil .\nIt will disturb you .\nThe vehicle that is used by the U.S. Government and the CIA to traffick these children and run these Satanic ritual abuse networks , is the government funded Child Social Services and Foster Care network , most commonly known as \u201c CPS \u201d ( Child Protection Services ) .\nMassive government funds exist for all 50 U.S. States that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain quotas of children put into this system , so many children are literally kidnapped , mostly medically kidnapped , from their parents to meet the demand for children in this evil , Satanic system , which is mostly operated by Christian Churches collecting funds from the Government .\nMany people have courageously tried to expose this evil system that exists in every state and every county within the U.S. , and sadly , many of them are now dead .\nIn 2009 , Bill Bowen released a trailer for a documentary film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Child Protection Services across the United States .\nThe film is called Innocence Destroyed .\nBill Bowen died unexpectedly the next year , in 2010 , reportedly from a heart attack , before he was able to finish the film .\nThe segments that were completed were published on YouTube , in three different videos .\nTo preserve Bill \u2019 s work we have combined all 3 segments and published them on our Bitchute channel .\nWARNING : Video contains graphic content not suitable for children !\nFor adults only .\nAnother person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network was Georgia Senator Nancy Schaefer .\nBefore she was murdered , she had produced evidence of this corruption , and the main lecture she gave on that evidence is now hard to find on YouTube , so we have published it on our Bitchute channel .\nThis lecture and the report that she created cost her her career , and ultimately her life .\nLearn more about Senator Nancy Schaefer here including the report that she wrote .\nNancy was interviewed by Alex Jones just 7 months before her murder , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched on her work .\nThe interview was originally broken up into several parts and published on YouTube , but most of those copies have disappeared .\nWe uploaded a copy of the interview to our Bitchute channel .\nAnother State Senator who tried to expose the corruption in CPS and child sex trafficking and was murdered in the summer of 2019 was Arkansas Senator Linda Collins-Smith .\nWe covered her story in 2019 , and it also has ties to child sex trafficking in Arizona , which I covered on a radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KFNX out of Phoenix .\nThe radio broadcast we did is still on YouTube , and if it disappears just let us know and we will publish it on our other video platforms .\nMuch of this very evil Satanic ritual abuse and child sex trafficking happening in the United States was exposed in 2016 by Julian Assange and Wikileaks , which was named \u201c Pizza Gate.\n\u201d I believe this is the main reason why Hillary Clinton was thrown under the bus in 2016 , because she had too many ties to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead , not because he wasn \u2019 t involved in all this ( there is evidence , including being in Epstein \u2019 s black book , that Trump has been part of all this also , and a book published by investigative journalists chronicle dozens of women and girls who say they were sexually molested by Trump ) , but because he was not part of the political establishment but part of the Wall Street Billionaire club and could be counted on to usher in the Great Reset and the COVID plandemic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public from concentrating on the evil child trafficking network .\nThis is my opinion , but it would also explain why the CIA probably developed \u201c Q \u201d and pretended to make Trump look like a \u201c savior \u201d who was going to come in and \u201c drain the swamp \u201d of all these child traffickers .\nAnd it worked brilliantly as a distraction from the truth .\nBut just the opposite happened .\nHe further enriched the Globalists , and carried out the COVID plan with great precision , distracting people with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trafficking and Satanic ritual abuse by concentrating on the \u201c war against the virus.\n\u201d Biden was probably brought in to not only continue the COVID policies including rolling out the bioweapon shots , but to also reverse all the work done on our southern border to allow a fresh flow of children and criminals to keep the child trafficking and Satanic ritual abuse operation going .\nI have been covering this issue for many years now , and it is why I have no hope that this country will ever see justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughly corrupt , and I have been threatened numerous times by judges in family courts , including district attorneys ( mostly in Arizona ) , to take down our articles because they expose their corruption .\nBut by the Grace of God I am still alive , still publishing , and to date have NOT TAKEN DOWN ONE SINGLE ARTICLE on this topic .\nHere is the article written by Russ Winter on The Finders .\nThe FBI Declassifies Files on The Finders and McMartin Pre-school Child Trafficking Cases In 1983 , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California community of Manhattan Beach went to the police , claiming that her 2-year-old son had been molested by Raymond \u201c Ray \u201d Buckey , a 28-year-old teacher at McMartin Preschool .\nPolice began their investigation by notifying the parents of current and former students about the possibility of sexual abuse their child .\nNumerous children told similar stories of satanic animal sacrifices and sexual rituals in secret rooms at the school .\nBy 1984 , Buckey was arrested on 79 counts of child molestation .\nHis mother was also arrested as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the Buckey family , because McMartin Preschool was owned and operated by the Buckey-McMartin family .\nThe children said they were warned that if they told anyone , their parents would be killed .\nAnd sure enough , just as Buckey \u2019 s trial got underway in 1986 \u2014 a trial in which Judy Johnson was a key witness \u2014 she was discovered dead in her home , cause unknown .\nShe was just 42 years old .\nAlmost exactly one year later , a former police officer who served as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home .\nWith Johnson dead , Buckey \u2019 s defense attorney was able to impeach her character during the trial .\nIt was also argued that the testimony of the children had been influenced ( or implanted ) by the psychological examiners who interviewed them .\nUltimately , Buckey was not convicted .\nA second jury deadlocked in 1990 , and the case was dismissed .\nFor six years , the police and the FBI had actively investigated the McMartin Preschool case , according to the Los Angeles Times .\nAfter they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family revealed they had sold the shuttered McMartin Preschool to Arnold Goldstein for the development of an office building \u2014 frustrated parents of the abused children hired the subsequently retired chief and head of the Los Angeles FBI , special agent Ted L. Gunderson ( 1928-2011 ) to continue with the investigation , and commissioned an archaeological survey .\nA decade later , you could find Gunderson speaking out about the McMartin case as well as a network of child molesters and traffickers called \u201c The Finders.\n\u201d For decades , the FBI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and The Finders were sealed .\nNot anymore .\nThe agency declassified and released its

"title": "Top 12 Takeaways From the Joe Rogan and Dr. Robert Malone Interview", "content": "One of the most insightful dialogues of 2021 was Joe Rogan \u2019 s interview of Dr. Robert Malone .\nDr. Malone invented the mRNA technology that is being used in the experimental covid injections .\nDr. Malone has developed medical products , drugs and clinical trials .\nHe has worked directly with Dr. Anthony Fauci and scientists at the Centers for Disease Control .\nHowever , at this critical moment in history , he refuses to follow along with their vax-all agenda that has quashed medical ethics and destroyed the principles of medical privacy and informed consent .\nFor not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twitter .\nHe was also de-platformed and then re-instated from LinkedIn , for stating the simple fact that the head of Reuters is on the board of Pfizer .\n( Reuters is used as the end-all , know-all fact checker for Twitter and other social media sites ) .\nRobert Malone vows to continue \u201c telling the truth \u201d \u2014 even as the drug companies try to censor his voice .\nHere are some major takeaways from the Rogan/Malone interview : \u2022 The gain-of-function research behind the development of the bioweapon spike protein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a similar , but different spike protein which is currently being used as mRNA instructions in the covid injection .\nThe drug companies have an ethical obligation to prove that the spike protein in their vax is not toxic , said Malone .\n\u2022 Many people are not acutely injured by the injections and some show no adverse effects at all .\nRogan asked why .\nMalone explained that the response curve is due to variances in the individual immune system , including phenotypic/genetic differences .\n\u2022 Malone spoke about the term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falsely shame people who do not take orders from public health officials .\nIt \u2019 s similarly used to socially ostracize anyone who dissents to drug company propaganda .\nMalone discussed the BBC \u2019 s Trusted New Initiative which charges individuals for spreading \u201c misinformation \u201d if they speak out against Tedros , Fauci , or other vax propagandists .\n\u2022 Dr. Malone emphasized the trauma that is being imparted in children \u2019 s minds , and the subsequent dehumanization , de-socialization and abuse that is being used against children with forced masks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin were smeared by the media and blocked by the regulatory establishment , Malone said two people were key in this decision .\nOne of them was vaxx promoter Rick Bright , who runs the Pandemic Prevention Institute at The Rockefeller Foundation .\nRick Bright used his position as Director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to discredit chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine , two drugs that displayed a history of safety and effectiveness against SARS-CoV-1 .\n\u2022 The other figure who blocked treatments for covid-19 was Janet Woodcock .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Food and Drug Administration on January 20 , 2021 , she used the agency to mock ivermectin and contort its proper use in humans with its veterinary applications .\nSenator Ron Johnson wrote to Woodcock , Fauci and other public health officials , detailing their concern that efficacious treatments were being withheld to push out dangerous injections , for which informed consent has not properly been applied .\nDr. Malone did not speculate on Woodcock and Bright \u2019 s intentions , but said they were wrong in their assertions .\n\u2022 Both hydroxychloroquine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list provided by the World Health Organization .\nBillions of doses have been safely administered .\nThese drugs ease symptoms and shorten the duration of illness , preventing severe disease and death .\nMalone also said that Merck \u2019 s repeated attacks on both drugs is bizarre , to say the least \u2013 especially since high ivermectin use in Uttar Pradesh was associated with lower mortality rates .\n\u2022 Joe Rogan asked Malone about the financial incentive to diagnose covid-19 in the hospital setting .\nMalone said hospitals are reimbursed around $ 3,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are withheld because the hospitals are further incentivized to use remdesivir and ventilators , which are linked to renal failure , lung damage , and deadly nosocomial infection .\nIt doesn \u2019 t matter why the individual was initially hospitalized , whether they were suffering from underlying conditions , mediation errors , delayed surgeries , etc .\nIf the hospital \u201c suspects \u201d covid-19 or can get a positive reading on a high cycle threshold PCR test , the hospital can fraudulently declare a covid-19 diagnosis and be reimbursed for their medical fraud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waning efficacy of the injections , Malone concurred that the injections are leading to negative efficacy , like in the Denmark studies .\nAs doses are increased , individuals become more prone to infection .\nIn Israel , the citizens are being coerced to take a fourth dose , and the data shows enhanced disease in the vaxxed .\nTheir B and T memory cells are being trained to attack a spike protein that has long since mutated , setting the vaxxed up for antibody dependent enhancement , autoimmune issues and cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immunity and the studies that prove the superiority of innate immunity over half-baked , vaxx-augmented immune responses .\n\u2022 Malone points to disturbing trends in myocarditis in young boys , post inoculations .\nHe spoke about the infertility risk due to the effect of lipid nano-particles on women \u2019 s ovaries .\nHe warned about the spike protein and its propensity to cause blood clots .\nThey discussed the censorship of Maddie de Garay , the young girl who was acutely injured in the Pfizer trial .\nMalone said that financial incentives and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on injection injuries , while promoting contrived end points that make the vax look good .\n\u2022 Malone warned : \u201c Our government is out of control on this .\nThey are lawless , they completely disregard bioethics \u201d and \u201c these mandates of an experimental injection are explicitly illegal , they are explicitly inconsistent with the Nuremberg Code .\n\u201d", "author": "HAF", "url":

Dr. Robert Malone calls a \u201c mass casualty event \u201d that \u2019 s unfolding due to covid injections .\nThis is a red alert situation unfolding right in front of us .\nThe human race is being slaughtered through the injection of \u201c clot shots \u201d that are deliberately designed to reduce global population through death and infertility .\nAll the politicians , scientists , regulators and journalists who are in on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they are even targeting children .\nAn article published by The Center Square ( Indiana ) reveals how Scott Davison , CEO of OneAmerica ( a life insurance company ) is sounding the alarm over a 40 % increase in total deaths among Americans aged 18 to 64 ( i.e .\nworking-aged Americans ) : \u201c We are seeing , right now , the highest death rates we have seen in the history of this business \u2013 not just at OneAmerica , \u201d the company \u2019 s CEO Scott Davison said during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c The data is consistent across every player in that business.\n\u201d Davison said the increase in deaths represents \u201c huge , huge numbers , \u201d and that \u2019 s it \u2019 s not elderly people who are dying , but \u201c primarily working-age people 18 to 64 \u201d who are the employees of companies that have group life insurance plans through OneAmerica .\n\u201c And what we saw just in third quarter , we \u2019 re seeing it continue into fourth quarter , is that death rates are up 40 % over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said .\n\u201c Just to give you an idea of how bad that is , a three-sigma or a one-in-200-year catastrophe would be 10 % increase over pre-pandemic , \u201d he said .\n\u201c So 40 % is just unheard of.\n\u201d There are several critical points to understand here : \u2022 The data being quoted by CEO Scott Davison are third quarter data from 2021 .\nThe numbers will be far worse in the fourth quarter because vaccine immune system damage worsens over time .\n\u2022 These deaths are not being classified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from other causes , according to medical records : Cancer , autoimmune disorders , heart attacks , strokes , etc .\nThese are largely adverse reactions from covid vaccines , of course , as the FDA has long known .\n( See page 16 of this FDA document from 2020 , where it lists all the suspected side effects of covid vaccines , including death . )\n\u2022 If a 10 % increase in deaths is a three-sigma event , a 40 % increase is something higher than a twelve-sigma event ( it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2026 meaning this is not mere coincidence .\nThere is a common cause behind these deaths .\nThat cause , of course , is covid injections , which we have concluded are depopulation bioweapons .\n\u2022 Life insurance companies are facing financial collapse as this trend continues ( which it will ) .\nThey will soon need a government bailout , and life insurance rates being charged to employees will skyrocket .\nDo the math : Here \u2019 s how we get to nearly 100,000 excess deaths per month in America right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 7,755 deaths per day in the USA , pre-covid .\nThe 40 % increase in mortality now being seen by life insurance companies , if applied across all age groups , would mean an additional 3,100 deaths per day .\nMultiply that by 30 days and you get over 93,000 excess deaths per month in the USA .\nRemember , this is based on third quarter data from 2020 , yet we know that vaccines cause immune system failure to worsen over time .\nThis means fourth quarter data will be even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will likely be worse still .\nIn addition , we have cancer deaths starting to skyrocket due to spike protein interference with chromosomal damage repair mechanisms , which is why I \u2019 m predicting we will see over 1 million cancer deaths in calendar 2022 , which is roughly a doubling of the usual cancer death statistics .\nGiven these accelerating factors \u2014 failing immunity , accelerated cancer tumor growth and the addition of yet more booster shots \u2014 there \u2019 s no question that 2022 is going to see an extra one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps many more .\n( It could be 1.5 million or even 2 million . )\nIf the booster shots are aggressively pushed and we see Antibody Dependent Enhancement accelerate as common flu strains are circulated , we could be looking at a doubling of the total death rate , going from 7,700 daily deaths to 15,400 deaths per day .\nThis means we would be losing nearly 1.7 % of the entire U.S. population in just one year ( that \u2019 s the sum of normal deaths plus the extrapolation of excess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all happening because the covid \u201c vaccines \u201d are really depopulation bioweapons .\nDr. Robert Malone has noticed the signals and has sent a new warning to the world in this article : It is starting to look to me like the largest experiment on human beings in recorded history has failed .\nAnd , if this rather dry report from a senior Indiana life insurance executive holds true , then Reiner Fuellmich \u2019 s \u201c Crimes against Humanity \u201d push for convening new Nuremberg trials starts to look a lot less quixotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this holds true , then the genetic vaccines so aggressively promoted have failed , and the clear federal campaign to prevent early treatment with lifesaving drugs has contributed to a massive , avoidable loss of life .\nAT WORST , this report implies that the federal workplace vaccine mandates have driven what appear to be a true crime against humanity .\nMassive loss of life in ( presumably ) workers that have been forced to accept a toxic vaccine at higher frequency relative to the general population of Indiana .\nFURTHERMORE , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massive , globally coordinated propaganda and censorship campaign in the history of the human race .\nAll major mass media and the social media technology companies have coordinated to stifle and suppress any discussion of the risks of the genetic vaccines AND/OR alternative early treatments .\nThis article reads like a dry description of an avoidable mass casualty event caused by a mandated experimental medical procedure .\nOne for which all opportunities for the victims to have become self-informed about the potential risks have been methodically erased from both the internet and public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the flag of the \u201c Trusted News Initiative \u201d .\nGeorge Orwell must be spinning in his grave .\nThis is a \u201c mass casualty event \u201d and the vaccine pushers are doing it deliberately The upshot of all this is that covid vaccines are creating a \u201c mass casualty event.\n\u201d Worse yet , it \u2019 s all deliberate .\nAll the tyrants and genocidal maniacs pushing these vaccines are carrying out an actual vaccine holocaust that will likely kill between 1 to 2 billion people worldwide over the next decade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped right now .\nThey are doing it on purpose .\nBig Tech , Big Pharma , Big Media and Big Government are all conspiring to achieve a planetary-scale ethnic cleansing campaign involving mass suffering and death across human civilization .\nYou are literally living through a global holocaust disguised as a

\u201c totalitarian \u201d methods of \u201c mind control \u201d to instill fear in the population .\nIn Canada , the military also admitted launching a psychological operations campaign against their own people in order to manipulate them into compliance with COVID-19 restrictions and mandates .\nDuring his viral podcast with Joe Rogan after he was banned by Twitter , Malone explained how the

pandemic and exaggerated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backed up by leaked details of how the UK government manipulated its population during the early days of the pandemic .\nAs first revealed by author and

sufficiently personally threatened \u201d .\nOne scientist with the SPI-B admits that \u201c In March [ 2020 ] the Government was very worried about compliance and they thought people wouldn \u2019 t want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussions about fear being needed to encourage compliance , and decisions were made about how to ramp up the fear.\n\u201d The unnamed scientist adds that \u201c The way we have used fear is dystopian.\n\u201d The scientist further confessed that \u201c The use of fear has definitely been ethically questionable .\nIt \u2019 s been like a weird experiment .\nUltimately , it backfired because people became too scared.\n\u201d Another separate scientist on the subcommittee professed \u201c You could call psychology \u2018 mind control \u2019 .\nThat \u2019 s what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in a positive way , but it has been used nefariously in the past.\n\u201d Another scientist warned that \u201c We have to be very careful about the authoritarianism that is creeping in , \u201d adding \u201c people use the pandemic to grab power and drive through things that wouldn \u2019 t happen otherwise.\n\u201d According to the report , another researcher with the group acknowledged that \u201c Without a vaccine , psychology is your main weapon , \u201d adding that \u201c Psychology has had a really good epidemic , actually.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they have been

manipulative.\n\u201d \u201c They have too much power and it intoxicates them \u201d , the scientist further warned .\nIn addition to the UK government \u2019 s response , it was also revealed that

February in Michelle Ruiz \u2019 s Vogue feature headlined , \u201c For Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Christine Grady , Love Conquers All.\n\u201d Back in 1983 , Grady was a clinical nurse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to dinner .\nIt was \u201c love at first sight , \u201d Fauci told Ruiz , \u201c she was intelligent , beautiful , spoke multiple languages , and she had a very wonderful bedside manner.\n\u201d Fauci and Grady married in 1985 and the pair now form a \u201c a medical power couple leading the fight against the coronavirus.\n\u201d Nice story , but it wasn \u2019 t exactly love at first sight .\n\u201c The couple met at the outset of the AIDS epidemic , \u201d Ruiz explained , \u201c with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inviting activists to the table on scientific and medical discussions.\n\u201d Grady had served on President Reagan \u2019 s HIV/AIDS commission , and the couple found their true bond in the government response to AIDS .\nFauci predicted that AIDS would ravage the entire population but as Michael Fumento showed in The Myth of Heterosexual AIDS , that never happened .\nFauci \u2019 s wife earned a Ph.D. in philosophy and bioethics from Georgetown but she is not a medical doctor and , like her husband , holds no advanced degrees in biochemistry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grady authored The Search for an AIDS Vaccine : Ethical Issues in the Development and Testing of a Preventative AIDS Vaccine .\nAs the back cover explains , \u201c Grady explores the current wisdom governing research with human subjects \u201d ( emphasis added ) and \u201c clinical trials are already ongoing.\n\u201d Those would be clinical trials of drugs .\nFauci \u2019 s remedy of choice for AIDS was AZT ( azidothymidine ) , marketed under the names Zidovudine or Retrovir .\nThe drug has toxic effects but in the summer of 1989 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on pregnant mothers with HIV .\nAs UC Berkeley molecular biologist Peter Duesberg explained in Inventing the AIDs Virus , \u201c a drug that interferes with growth can lead only to physical deformities in babies developing in the womb.\n\u201d By all indications , nurse and bioethicist Christine Grady was sanguine about these trials , not the last of their kind to test human subjects with AZT and other powerful drugs .\nIn 1992 , Fauci \u2019 s NIAID provided funding for the Incarnation Children \u2019 s Center ( ICC ) in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children .\nThe city \u2019 s Administration for Children \u2019 s Services ( ACS ) offered up children under its care , nearly all of them African American , for secretive drug experimentation .\nAs the BBC \u2019 s 2004 documentary \u201c Guinea Pig Kids , \u201d demonstrated , drugs forced on the children included AZT , Didanosine and Nevirapine .\nAccording to biochemist Dr. David Rasnick , the children were going to be miserable and one nurse discovered that some 80 of the children died .\nThe medical establishment attacked the documentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmed that children were enrolled without proper consent and many were subjected to medication trials not reviewed by an advisory panel .\nIn 2014 , Valerie Leiter and Sarah Herman of Simmons College found similarities between Fauci \u2019 s NIAID-backed drug trials and the government \u2019 s Tuskegee syphilis study .\nSince most of the children in the New York trials were black , the authors branded the case a \u201c modern Tuskegee.\n\u201d If nurse , bioethicist , and mother of three , Christine Grady , objected to these experiments on human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn 2012 , the NIH named Christine Grady chief of the Department of Bioethics of the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center .\nGrady came billed as \u201c a strong international voice in human subjects protections , \u201d but no word that she had been married to Fauci for nearly 30 years , and nothing on the conflict of interest in the new arrangement .\nSince NIH ethics guide NIAID , Grady \u2019 s ethical decisions inform her husband \u2019 s research and development decisions .\nFauci decided to fund dangerous gain-of-function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Communist China .\nNo word from Grady about the ethics of making viruses more lethal and more transmissible .\nFauci and NIH boss Francis Collins both lied about funding that research , but no word from Grady on the ethics of that deception .\nIn early 2020 , Fauci opposed President Trump

the American people ?\nThis issue has been with us since George Washington took office in 1789 .\nA small cadre of interconnected bankers was already well-established in England , France , Austria , Germany , and Italy .\nThese bankers took advantage of the chaos growing out of the rejection of Roman Catholicism and the social breakdown and vehement hatreds that grew out of the Protestant Reformation by funding both sides ( through government debt ) of the many resultant wars and revolutions and then funding the peace afterward .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the revolutionary turmoil of the 19th and early 20th centuries , world bankers wove through societies like a malignancy , manipulating world leaders , destabilizing whole nations of people , and supporting philosophies that promote centralized authority ( including international authority ) that would strengthen world banking arrangements .\nAmerica is a different matter .\nFirst , we are isolated by two oceans and developed a stable and productive society away from the horrors of Europe .\nWe had no Roman Catholic experience to reject .\nWe did reject atheism \u2014 we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation .\nThe federal Constitution , as well as each state Constitution , created a framework for ordered Liberty \u2014 America \u2019 s unique and irreplaceable Rule of Law .\nDecentralizing authority \u2014 Federalism \u2014 is one of the philosophical anchors to that framework .\nBut we have been the prize for this group since the beginning of our Republic .\nCreating central banks in each country that the cartel

significant being the Bank of England .\nWhen the charter for the First Bank of the United States was not renewed amid great public opposition in 1811 , it was one more point of contention between the

not have happened .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Napoleonic wars .\nEngland was concerned that the U.S. was helping Napoleon .\nThe British were impressing U.S. sailors into the British Navy , they feared American

problems and forget that these ideologies do not function in a vacuum ; they can not wreak havoc by themselves , they need psychopathic people directing them to do real damage .\nThere is something about collectivism that lends itself to projection and hypocrisy ( collectivism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voluntary ) .\nI suppose when your political ideology becomes your religion it \u2019 s easy to turn into a zealot .\nAnd while zealots find power in their single-mindedness and their cultism they also tend to lack any self-awareness .\nThey literally go insane with devotion to their cause to the point that they lose track of whether or not their cause is fair and just .\nTheir behavior becomes increasingly erratic and disjointed and every person they run into that does not share their views is immediately seen as a heretical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed .\nTo outsiders looking in , zealots are an endless source of comedy .\nYou can \u2019 t help but laugh because their ticks and cricks and outbursts are nonsensical and absurd ( just check out \u201c Libs Of Tik Tok \u201d for a mountain of examples ) .\nAs long as they don \u2019 t have any real power these people act as a reminder of

\u2019 s when things stop being funny .\nCivilizations throughout history have consistently dealt with the problem of zealots , but the greater threat is the existence of narcissists and psychopaths sneaking into positions of authority and encouraging zealotry among the masses .\nGenerally , psychopaths are seen as an anomaly which is quickly identified and shunned in order to prevent them from climbing too high up the ladder of social influence .\nThe problem is they are not as rare as one might hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hide among the herd .\nAround 1 % of any given population is made up of psychopaths while another 1 % are sociopaths .\nAround 5 % of people are identified as having narcissistic traits .\nNarcissists are self absorbed and view themselves as superior to everyone else \u2013 They believe they are entitled to adoration and authority .\nSociopaths have an inability to feel empathy for others and this makes them impractical as leaders .\nPsychopaths also exhibit a lack of empathy but also have a propensity for emotional or physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering of others and perpetrate a large number of violent crimes .\nEven though psychopaths are 1 % of the population , they make up 15 % to 25 % of those incarcerated in prisons .\nThe drag they exert on society can not be overstated .\nThere is definitely some overlap among the various types , but in general close to 10 % of human beings exhibit dangerous and mostly inherent psychological malfunctions that are often not treatable .\nThink about that for a moment \u2013 10 out of every 100 people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life miserable for the rest of us .\nTo be sure , some of them are still able to function in society .\nSociopaths in particular can become valuable in fields where less empathy is required in order to accomplish certain tasks .\nThey are particularly well suited as surgeons , EMTs , soldiers , firefighters , and any other job where seeing people in pain is not going to stop them from saving lives .\nThey don \u2019 t necessarily take joy in seeing others harmed , but they aren \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as they are never allowed into positions of influence over large groups of people they can serve some good for the public .\nHistory shows us that vetting and preventing psychologically broken individuals from slipping into institutions that offer power is not so easy .\nIn fact , many monarchies and empires were built on systems that allowed psychopaths and narcissists to flourish because they relied on genetic succession .\nIf a monarch had a son that was predisposed to psychopathy it did not matter , that crazed prince would one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could be done about it .\nThere was no vetting process .\nAlso , many such traits are passed on genetically , which means a power structure built on heredity could become progressively more destructive as psychopaths in royalty intermarry .\nThis would help explain why psychopathic behavior is over-represented among monarchs of the past .\nThe creation of democracy and democratic republics was in part designed to help weed out aberrant individuals by using open elections and the voting process .\nIn other words , let the people scrutinize candidates and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nUnfortunately , this doesn \u2019 t work too well if ALL the candidates are psychopaths and the public has no real choice .\nBy extension , psychopaths have also found ways to circumvent the political process and control it without directly participating in it .\nThe corporate world and financial institutions allow psychopaths to influence politics from behind the curtain , buying off candidates and their loyalty or vetting candidates and ONLY allowing those with similar sociopathic , narcissistic and psychopathic habits through the selection process and into the political arena .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ societies the ability to identify and root out psychologically broken individuals and prevent them from becoming leaders was easier .\nIn the midst of vast empires and technocracy it is much simpler for psychopaths to hide among normal people and blend in .\nI usually compare invasive psychopaths to mythological stories of vampires for this reason .\nI really can \u2019 t think of a better analogy .\nThey insinuate themselves into a population , take up positions of influence which protect them from suspicion and then systematically bleed the town dry .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in their nature and they can not be fixed , they can only be removed as a parasite is removed from a host .\nThese people are the top threats to any given civilization .\nThey are moderators of chaos and they actively conspire to supplant free society .\nThey are what I would call primary organized psychopaths and they do indeed work together for mutual gain , much like a pack of wolves .\nThey represent the 1 % of the 1 % ( i.e .\nthe globalists ) .\nPsychopaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been organized for a long time , but what about the millions of other people out there with such traits ?\nWhat happens when they are given a way to congregate ?\nModern society and Big Tech social media have created even worse circumstances because now the greater psychopathic community is no longer isolated .\nThat 1 % that used to be mostly relegated to quiet corners and the fringes of humanity are now able to organize into aggressive mobs of hundreds of thousands , leading millions of lesser sociopaths and narcissists .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would call communal insanity \u2013 As the old saying goes , the patients are taking over the asylum .\nWe see this specifically with the political left and the open promotion of narcissism as an acceptable way of life .\nThis is not to say that psychopaths don \u2019 t try to infiltrate conservative circles as well , only that leftists are much more welcoming to their kind .\nThese are people that once felt powerless because they were shunned and now they want revenge .\nThe thing is , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good reason ; they are not psychologically equipped to handle any measure of power .\nNow they are being handed institutional control and they are being whipped into a frothing frenzy .\nThey see themselves as the underdogs and the \u201c revolutionaries \u201d , but really they are just emotionally stunted and handicapped and they were put in

mind .\nWe can no longer ignore the effect these people have on humanity as a whole .\nThe first step would require separation from movements and institutions that promote psychopathic and

needs special attention and \u201c nurturing.\n\u201d As noted , in many cases these characteristics are inherent ( inborn ) and can not be treated .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not so much an illness as it is a completely different psychological structure .\nThey might as well be a different species , and a predatory one at that .\nThere is no mutual coexistence with them .\nThey see us as food .\nCandidates for positions of authority would have to be screened for psychopathy , narcissism and sociopathy .\nIf they have too many of the warning signs then they should not be allowed to pursue those jobs .\nThis is the only answer beyond fundamentally changing the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 m not necessarily opposed to either .\nA random lottery system for government jobs along with strict term limits ( not just for normal political positions but also in bureaucratic positions ) would at least be better than what we have now .\nI would rather risk the possibility of less qualified people being randomly chosen for government than have a system that attracts a concentrated culture of malicious parasites .\nWhat better way to discourage psychopaths than to take away any long term benefits of working in government ?\nWhat better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elitists than to take away their ability to finance or choose the candidates that end up in office ?\nAnd even if they were able to buy off some officials , with term limits they would have to start over and over again with the latest crop of new officials .\nSome will of course point out that changing the system tomorrow will require getting rid of the psychopaths that run it today .\nI agree , it \u2019 s a dilemma .\nSadly , once psychopaths become organized and entrenched history tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the force of violence

mad hatters hungry for scraps from the table of power .\nWe can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collectivist mob and the zealots , but all psychopaths view separation as defiance and will try to interfere .\nEventually there \u2019 s going to be a fight , and maybe that \u2019 s for the best .", "author": "HAF", "url":

released a 15-day plan to slow the spread of the coronavirus in the US .\nThat was 663 days ago .\nWe are now nearly two years , 2 presidents , 6 trillion dollars , and countless stolen rights into slowing the spread .\nOver the last two years , one of the largest power grabs in the history of the world has taken place as fearful citizens willingly surrendered their rights to the state for the promise of safety .\nBut that safety never came and it never will .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slew of arbitrary and often ridiculous mandates and decrees from politicians who think that government force can stop a pandemic .\nDespite the economically devastating draconian lockdowns that killed countless small businesses , vaccine passports , and mask mandates , COVID-19 returned \u2014 with a vengeance .\nOne of the most heavily vaccinated places on the planet , with the strictest vaccine mandates in the country , New York City , accounted for nearly 10 % of all cases in the U.S .\nBut that is not all .\nEven as states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , force citizens to wear masks and fire people for refusing the jab , the U.S. set a record for the highest daily case count in the entire world \u2014 at 1 million .\nAs TFTP has reported , we predicted this .\nSeveral studies have shown that the lockdowns were not effective at stopping the virus .\nIn June , we reported on the study from the National Bureau of Economic Research which analyzed data from 44 countries and all 50 states .\nThe study from the NBER found that these restrictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and greatly exacerbated the destruction of the working class \u2014 but have in fact resulted in an increase of excess mortality .\nAt the end of the day , they cost more lives than they saved .\nAlso in June , TFTP covered the findings of an MIT scientist who reported a data analysis of the economic impact of the lockdown \u2014 noting that whilst it played a key contributing role to the sharp rise of unemployment , it did not make a significant reduction in deaths .\nAnd on June 22 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that while this policy did not save lives it decimated the economy ; while modern robber barons such as Zuckerberg , Gates , and Bezos saw their portfolios expand exponentially .\nThis was yet another report , as TFTP \u2019 s Don Via Jr. pointed out , that much like the aforementioned , did not receive national headlines from the corporate media .\nWhile many folks , including those in government , have begun to open their eyes to the data and realize that locking people in their homes , shutting down society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will does not stop Covid , others are still pressing on .\nDespite experts , world wide , weighing in on the harms of school closures and masking children , bureaucrats across the country are beating that dead horse .\nCountries across Europe , with the highest vaccination rates in the world , are now going into yet another round of lockdowns as cases hit record numbers .\nThe floundering bureaucracy is seemingly unconcerned with actual science and continues to implement policies which have had no effect on slowing the virus : masks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after their policies have failed , they need someone to blame .\nPredictably , they have ramped up the scapegoating of the unvaccinated .\nThe virus is spreading , were are told , including widely throughout the vaccinated population , because of the unvaccinated \u2014 who are now dirty \u201c non-citizens.\n\u201d On Tuesday , French President Macron gave an interview to the La Parisien , in which he dehumanized the unvaccinated and urged other citizens to hate them , likening them to their \u201c worst enemies.\n\u201d \u201c I am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Macron told the readers of Le Parisien .\n\u201c But as for the non-vaccinated , I really want to piss them off .\nAnd we will continue to do this , to the end .\nThis is the strategy.\n\u201d He declared that \u201c worst enemies \u201d of \u201c democracy \u201d are \u201c lies and stupidity , \u201d then declared that his government is \u201c putting pressure on the unvaccinated by limiting , as much as possible , their access to activities in social life.\n\u201d Canadian PM Trudeau followed suit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada that they need to be \u201c angry \u201d at the unvaccinated for spreading covid , using his pulpit to dehumanize and threaten people for their personal medical choices .\nNot wanting to be left out , President Biden also spoke up , once again falsely claiming that we are in a pandemic of the unvaccinated and telling vaccinated people that there is nothing to worry about \u2014 despite the recent surge in hospitalizations among the vaccinated population .\nBut then again , it is likely the fault of the people who didn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can still get COVID , but it \u2019 s highly unlikely that you \u2019 ll become seriously ill , \u2019 \u2019 Biden said .\n\u201c If you \u2019 re vaccinated and boosted , you are highly protected .\nBe concerned about omicron , but don \u2019 t be alarmed .\nAnd if you \u2019 re unvaccinated , you have some reasons to be alarmed .\nYou \u2019 ll experience severe illness in many cases.\n\u2019 \u2019 Biden then went on to encourage children to stay away from the unvaccinated , further stoking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This mass dehumanization by the establishment against people for their personal medical choices can not be ignored or understated .\nThis is the type of rhetoric that always lead to a two-tiered society in which the dehumanized sect suffers immensely under the authoritarians .\nIndeed , this mass suffering has already begun in many parts of the world .\nThis is why anti-lockdown protesters have taken to the streets across the planet to protest the lockdown tyrants .\nAnd how do the lockdown tyrants respond ?\nThey impose more restrictions .\nClearly we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make decisions which benefit freedom and liberty .\nIt is time Americans and the rest of the world realize that freedom is not some commodity to be traded in exchange for our obedience .\nFreedom , true freedom , is inalienable .\nIt \u2019 s time we act that way .", "author": "HAF",

the Biggest Lies They Told in 2021", "content": "If the past year has confirmed anything it is that the mainstream media is thoroughly dishonest .\nYes , most people already suspected this , but the last 12 months have provided more confirmation than the past several years combined .\n2021 has made it clear that the mainstream media is a propaganda arm of political and corporate elitists , from big government to big pharma .\nWhile there have been a few shining examples of independent and mostly unbiased journalism in the MSM , these moments are as rare as Loch Ness Monster sightings and almost as unbelievable .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistently that sometimes we ignore legitimate journalism when it pops up because it \u2019 s safer to assume the media is disingenuous at all times .\nI \u2019 ve personally noticed a wash of commercials lately paid for by major legacy media platforms like the New York Times desperately trying to convince the public that they are still relevant .\nThe message is that they are the only \u201c true source \u201d of news information while they beg people to start subscribing and reading their hot garbage once again .\nLeftist media is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ click-bait prostitutes like Buzzfeed and Vox imploding .\nThe lack of profits is obvious and the layoffs have been aggressive .\nThese platforms survived for the past few years on tech media hype and venture startup capital , but the free money has run out and now they don \u2019 t know what to do .\nBuzzfeed \u2019 s scheme was to go public and sell shares , but this plan failed so completely and the company \u2019 s stock plunged so hard that the event has exposed all other fledgling tech media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one has faith in these outlets , at least not enough to invest in them , and now the veil of their supposed \u201c success \u201d has been lifted .\nBuzzfeed used to claim they were worth $ 1.5 billion ; reality revealed they are worth almost nothing .\nLegacy media has also seen its audience numbers plummet over the past ten years , but the last year in particular has been especially unkind to them .\nALL of the major corporate news channels saw their audience ratings decline , with CNN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is facing an epic cut of 68 % in its prime time numbers in 2021 , while MSNBC now has the smallest prime time audience it has witnessed since 2016 .\nFox also dealt with audience declines this year but continues to remain the most watched cable news outlet so far , probably because of the continued popularity of commenters like Tucker Carlson .\nSome might blame the loss of election coverage , but it \u2019 s not as if there hasn \u2019 t been enough news to hype in 2021 .\nWith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and facing intermittent covid restrictions this year ( in blue states ) , you would think that this would represent a captive audience for the fear machine .\nHell , even YouTube and other social media platforms are forcing MSM content into our faces daily while burying any alternatives .\nYet , their numbers are still plunging and audiences are laughing .\nYouTube has even removed the \u201c Dislike \u201d button just to protect the corporate media and the White House from the hilarious bombardment of thumbs down they receive on every video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peasants to have the ability to voice our discontent .\nSo , where are people turning for their news if not the mainstream ?\nWhile stats are not as well tracked for independent sources , it is obvious from viewership and subscription numbers that the alternative media is quickly becoming the dominant force in information .\nMy own audience numbers have jumped at least 30 % in the past two years alone and this seems to be the trend across the board for conservative and libertarian media .\nWebsites like Social Blade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conclusion that the alternative media is becoming the go-to media .\nWhy is this happening ?\nIt \u2019 s actually been a long time coming .\nMainstream media numbers have been in decline for many years and their audience age brackets have been increasing dramatically .\nThis accelerated after 2016 when the mainstream media mask came off completely and what we now know as the \u201c Culture War \u201d revealed itself .\nThe migration of audiences is undeniable in entertainment and pop culture media .\nMainstream platforms funded by a steady cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Time Warner , Comcast , Viacom , etc , used to reign supreme in entertainment publications .\nModerately sized tech media operations clamored to remain in the good graces of these corporations in exchange for favors and special access .\nNow , operations with billions of dollars behind them are being thwarted by low cost do-it-yourself YouTube channels like Geeks And Gamers , The Quartering , Nerdrotic , Clownfish TV , etc .\nThe bloodletting has been so horrific that social media companies ( with a shared agenda ) have partnered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channels , demonetizing them or erasing them from public view with their algorithms .\nAlternative channels get so much attention because they offer something people want \u2013 An honest opinion and analysis instead of an opinion bought and paid for with corporate dollars .\nIn the political and social sphere there have been numerous success stories , including Joe Rogan \u2019 s podcast , Steven Crowder , Ben Shapiro , Blaze TV \u2019 s \u2018 You Are Here \u2019 , Tim Pool the list goes on and on .\nIn economic media , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in millions of readers that most other mainstream institutions WISH they had .\nTo be sure , some of these information sources are still playing catch-up to those of us once considered \u201c conspiracy theorists \u201d a few years ago .\nThat \u2019 s okay .\nI \u2019 m not saying that there isn \u2019 t more that could be done .\nWhat I \u2019 m saying is that there is a revolution happening in how people consume media and at least some truths are getting out there to the normies .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative media for 16 years and I don \u2019 t think many who are new to the field realize how much Americans have broken free from the mainstream narrative in that time .\nWhen I got started , to even dream of the audience numbers we now have was considered naive fantasy .\nToday I continue to find great hope in the growth of independent journalism .\nThe fact of the matter is , for decades corporate institutions conned the masses into believing only THEY were qualified to act as gatekeepers and guardians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the true \u201c journalists.\n\u201d They have now lost the respect of the public and their gatekeeping is over .\nOn that note , lets examine just a few of the reasons why trust in the mainstream has imploded .\nLets look at some of the biggest lies perpetuated by the MSM in 2021\u2026 Probably one of the most fake news stories of the decade .\nThe mainstream media has relentlessly parroted the propaganda that the conservative protest at the Capitol Building on Jan 6th was some kind of planned attempt at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in multiple deaths .\nThe reality was much less sexy .\nFirst , the FBI has been forced to admit there is no evidence supporting the claim that the protest was an organized coup .\nAnd when an institution that is extremely hostile to patriots admits this , you know the government has NOTHING .\nNot a single death originally attributed to the Jan 6 protesters was actually caused by them , so that tall tale has been tossed down the memory hole .\nWhile there was violence and an unarmed protester was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Babbitt ) , the result of the event was nothing close to an insurrection .\nProtesters walked in , milled around for a little while , some people stole some souvenirs , and then everyone left .\nIt can barely be considered a \u201c riot.\n\u201d Compare this to the BLM riots across the country which resulted in multiple actual killings by people directly participating , not to mention billions of dollars in property damage .\nThe media called these riots \u201c peaceful protests \u201d while condemning the Jan 6 participants as monsters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we go to the source instead of burning down the homes and businesses of innocent people .\nAnd I want to explain something else to leftists because I don \u2019 t think they get it \u2013 When you do see a conservative \u201c insurrection \u201d ( rebellion against centralized tyranny ) , they will not be unarmed like they were on Jan 6 and they will not stop until all corrupt elements of the establishment are removed from power .\nIf you were hiding under your beds over the events of Jan 6th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wow , what a politically charged mess the coverage of this event was .\nMultiple people die from a freak winter storm hitting Texas and taking down parts of their independent power grid and the first thing the mainstream media does is write hatchet stories about how this \u201c proves they could never secede from the union.\n\u201d These people are obsessed with centralization to the point that they lose their minds if you generate your own electricity .\nPaul Krugman , a notorious spin doctor for the establishment , went on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any and all evidence that federally funded Wind Turbine failures led to the Texas power grid crisis .\nThe facts on this are buried to this day .\nThe numbers prove Paul Krugman and the MSM utterly wrong .\nThe Mises Institutepublished a comprehensive article on this based on analysis from the Institute For Energy Research , but I \u2019 ll summarize : The MSM and Paul Krugman argued that the entire incident was caused by Texas \u2019 ill prepared natural gas powered grid and that Wind Turbines had nothing to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asserted that this makes any notion of a state like Texas becoming independent from centralized governance and a centralized grid \u201c laughable.\n\u201d It \u2019 s important to note that Krugman offers no real stats to support his arguments .\nAn \u201c economist \u201d should know better .\nThe truth is that failing wind turbines were indeed the primary source of the power grid decline .\nLeading up to the winter storm in February , wind turbines were generating around 28 % ( nearly one third ) of Texas power while natural gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the freeze wind power had dropped to 6 % while natural gas took up the slack and increased to 65 % of the grid .\nIn other words , Krugman either lied , or he was oblivious to the actual stats .\nWhile there were failures in some natural gas plants , the majority of the fault was in federally funded wind power .\nDuring the grid down crisis , natural gas lost 7 % of its overall output while the federally funded wind turbines lost 47 % output .\nTHIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind that power demand in the state skyrocketed at this time breaking all previous records , perhaps because the state population jumped from 29 million to 30 million from the end of 2019 to the beginning of 2021 .\nMillions of people had just transplanted to Texas in a matter of months to escape blue state policies such as high taxes and oppressive covid mandates .\nAnd here is where we find what is likely the core motive behind the media \u2019 s lies about Texas \u2013 The establishment does not want Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mandates .\nLying about Texas at any opportunity , even during tragedy , reveals their underlying fears .\nAnthony Fauci is perhaps the highest paid liar in recent history , but his lies go beyond simply acting as a propagandist for the government .\nThe covid pandemic has luckily resulted in a very low average Infection Fatality Rate ( only 0.27 % officially ) , meaning , over 99.7 % of the population at any given time has very little to worry about from the virus .\nWith the mild Omicron variant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling even further .\nHowever , there have been fatalities that did not need to happen and Fauci is partly to blame .\nDespite the fact that the largest Level 4 virology lab in Asia is in Wuhan , China right down the street from the epicenter of the Covid-19 outbreak , the mainstream media at the behest of the government and the medical establishment has fought tooth and nail to deny any connection .\nIf this was a murder investigation it would be like a detective walking in a room to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over it with a bloody knife , and then buying the suspect ice cream and sending him on his merry way .\nIf you didn \u2019 t witness the actual stabbing , why investigate further ?\nWhy was the media so adamant about ignoring the obvious ?\nMaybe because government agencies like the NIAD and NIH under the direction of Anthony Fauci were involved in funding clandestine \u201c Gain of Function \u201d research of corona viruses at that very lab in Wuhan .\nThis would explain why the initial strain of Covid that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a 96 % match to samples held at the lab since 2013 .\nThe other 4 % could be attributed to genetic manipulation through gain of function .\nFauci denied any involvement in gain of function research , which is predominantly used for the weaponization of a virus or other microorganisms .\nThe media violently defended him and accused anyone critical of Fauci of being crackpot conspiracy theorists .\nWell , it turns out he was lying again .\nThe release of over 900 documents related to coronavirus research funded by Fauci @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the media either blindly defended Fauci without looking at the evidence , or that they share the same agenda .\nThe Pandemic of the Unjabbed \u201c Breakout case \u201d is now a common term used in the media to describe fully jabbed people who still get sick from and die from covid infection .\nBut not long ago the narrative was that anyone and everyone falling ill from the virus was unvaccinated .\nThe media and the government still push the notion that unjabbed people are filling up hospitals and ICU beds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these claims .\nMeanwhile , the most jabbed countries on the planet are also dealing with some of the highest infection rates on the planet and continuing deaths .\nIn Ireland , for example , over 63 % of recent covid deaths were fully jabbed individuals .\nIn Israel , nearly 60 % of covid hospitalizations are fully vaccinated .\nUruguay , Bahrain , Maldives and Chile all have overwhelming majority vaccination rates and all of them have seen spikes in covid deaths and infections .\n\u2022 Most Vaccinated Country On Earth Closes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2014 35 % Of New Cases Are Fully Vaccinated Residents .\n\u2022 Leading Israeli Health Official : Vaccinated Account For 95 % Of Severe And 85-90 % Of New Covid Hospitalizations .\n\u2022 Denmark : Highest Infection Rate Since May , Despite 75 % Of Population Being Fully Vaccinated .\n\u2022 Ireland : Two Counties With 99.7 % And 98 % + \u2018 Fully Vaccinated \u2019 See Massive Covid \u2018 Outbreaks \u2019 .\n\u2022 Most Vaccinated State In America Now Seeing Massive Surge In Covid Hospitalizations .\n\u2022 Canadian Nurse Whistleblowers : Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Filled With The Fully Vaccinated .\nIf the jabs actually work , then how is this possible ?\nConclusion : The vaccines don \u2019 t work , at least not in the way that pharmaceutical companies initially claimed .\nAdd to this the fact that people with natural immunity are 13 to 27 times more protected from covid than people who submit to the jab .\nOne has to ask \u2013 What is the point of these experimental mRNA vaccines with no long term data to prove their safety ?\nMainstream media denial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time .\nNow , they can \u2019 t hide it anymore .\nWith price inflation hitting 40 year highs ( according to official numbers ) , the pocketbook of the average American is taking a massive hit , and it \u2019 s only going to get worse from here on .\nThe media appears to be specifically invested in hiding real economic data from the public and protecting the Federal Reserve and central banking practices in general .\nI won \u2019 t get into my theories on why this is the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue in my last article ) , I \u2019 ll only say that an unprepared populace is an easy to control populace when an economic crash occurs .\nThe movie industry was on the decline well before the covid pandemic happened , and it is undeniable that this was largely due to the extreme leftist propaganda implanted into Hollywood films since 2016 .\nYes , Hollywood was woke before then , but nowhere near as bad as the industry has become in the past five years .\nHollywood calls this politicization of films @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black and brown people in films is not the issue .\nRather , it is the injection of leftist woke ideology and cultism into everything from films to TV series to commercials .\nThe culture war is VERY real , and sadly , the biggest mistake of conservatives was to mostly ignore the fight in popular entertainment until recently .\nThere is hope , however , and it is found in the mantra of \u201c Get Woke Go Broke !\n\u201d Audiences are voting with their wallets and the consensus is that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertainment .\nFor the past couple years leftists in the media have said that the crash in theater profits has been caused by public fear over covid .\nThis excuse was recently destroyed by the latest Spiderman film , which has no woke politics and had audiences coming to theaters by the millions .\nThe film made over $ 1 billion in 5 days breaking previous records .\nClearly , covid is not a factor at all , but if you look at almost every failed movie this past year there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNo one wants it , no one likes it .\nThe media has no other means of denying it any longer .\nThere are many other lies I did not get a chance to cover here , but I think you get the picture .\nWho knows what the next year will bring in terms of spin from our corporate gatekeepers ?\nAt least , for now , the alternative media has stepped up to fill the void and bring facts where there was once only deception .\nIn order to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to get rid of us .\nOtherwise , the

what if the health carnage runs much deeper , on a different level , from drinking the likes of Monster Energy drinks ?\nTake heed of what you are about to read and see on video displayed before your

\u201d at the top .\nIt \u2019 s not connected .\nThe \u201c M \u201d in Monster has a short top , and a long tail , just like the letter \u201c vav \u201d in Hebrew , that also represents the number

.\nAre you addicted to \u201c beastly energy ?\n\u201d Next , the \u201c O \u201d in Monster displays a cross .\nIt \u2019 s an \u201c anti-Christ \u201d message so when you tip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , the cross is upside down ( hence witchcraft symbolism in action ) , while you \u201c Unleash the Beast , \u201d according to the top Monster slogan written on the cans and cartons .\nAre people

believe , think , and act against their natural impulses and in accordance with an imposed agenda .\nAmerican psychologist and professor emeritus at Stanford University , Phillip Zombardo , refers to mind control as , \u201c the process by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and action is compromised by agents or agencies that modify or distort perception , motivation , affect , cognition or behavioral outcomes.\n\u201d His ground breaking research project , The Stanford Prison Experiment , demonstrated that most people are highly susceptible to the influence of group behavior , and that many of us would go so far as to harm others just to be in compliance with the directives of someone in a perceived position of authority .\nIn today \u2019 s fustercluck world , the effects of mind control are evident everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifesting it its most dangerous form\u2026 mass psychosis .\nPeople living in this dark cloud of disillusionment are easily influenced and will readily sacrifice their own health and well-being in deference to the advice and mandates of \u2018 experts \u2019 and policy makers who pimp fear then offer a phony respite from it .\nConsider how this plays out in our society : 1 .\nDumb down the population with chemical sedatives including alcohol , pharmaceuticals and toxic food ingredients .\n2 .\nMonopolize the media under corporate control .\nPresent biased , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours a day , deliberately creating division and discord amongst the majority population .\n3 .\nCensor any information and opinions which counter the propaganda of the

out in opposition to the corporate state amounts to a physical threat to their safety .\n5 .\nElevate a culture of celebrity worship , and promote degeneracy and stupidity as virtuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children from an early age to learn obedience over critical thinking , while teaching them that the state is infallible no matter how many atrocities it commits .\n7 .\nIsolate people from each other .\nDisconnect them from the grounding and diverse influence of family and friends .\n8 .\nAssault the senses of the population with an endless stream of trauma based mind control and fear propaganda

campaigns which demonize them .\n14 .\nFocus the attention of the masses on an invisible , intangible , omni-present fear such as an unstoppable plague that is constantly changing forms .\n15 .\nRequire people to seek permission from the government for practically every productive endeavor possible .\n16 .\nCorral the masses into a system of technological control which prohibits free association and free enterprise , and punishes those most likely to resist .\n15 .\nElevate the most criminally insane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open-ended , free access to 24 hour monopolized media .\n16

in deaths .\nAnd on June 22 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that while this policy did not save lives it decimated the economy ; while modern robber barons such as Zuckerberg , Gates , and Bezos saw their portfolios expand exponentially .\nThis was yet another report , as TFTP \u2019 s Don Via Jr. pointed out , that much like the aforementioned , did not receive national headlines from the corporate media

Covid , others are still pressing on .\nDespite experts , world wide , weighing in on the harms of school closures and masking children , bureaucrats across the country are beating that dead horse .\nCountries across Europe , with the highest vaccination rates in the world , are now going into yet another round of lockdowns as cases hit record numbers .\nThe floundering bureaucracy is seemingly unconcerned with actual science and continues to implement policies which have had no effect on slowing the virus : masks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after their policies have failed , they need someone to blame .\nPredictably , they have ramped up the scapegoating of the unvaccinated .\nThe virus is spreading , were are told , including widely throughout the vaccinated population , because of the unvaccinated \u2014 who are now dirty \u201c non-citizens.\n\u201d On Tuesday , French President Macron gave an interview to the La Parisien , in which he dehumanized the unvaccinated and urged other citizens to hate them , likening them to their \u201c worst enemies.\n\u201d \u201c I am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Macron told the readers of Le Parisien .\n\u201c But as for the non-vaccinated , I

and stupidity , \u201d then declared that his government is \u201c putting pressure on the unvaccinated by limiting , as much as possible , their access to activities in social life.\n\u201d Canadian PM Trudeau followed suit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada that they need to be \u201c angry \u201d at the unvaccinated for spreading covid , using his pulpit to dehumanize and threaten people for their personal medical choices .\nNot wanting to be left out , President Biden also spoke up , once again falsely claiming that we are in a pandemic of the unvaccinated and telling vaccinated people that there is nothing to worry about \u2014 despite the recent surge in hospitalizations among the vaccinated population .\nBut then again , it is likely the fault of the people who didn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can still get COVID , but it \u2019 s highly unlikely that you \u2019 ll become seriously ill , \u2019 \u2019 Biden said .\n\u201c If you \u2019 re vaccinated and boosted , you are highly protected .\nBe concerned about omicron , but don \u2019 t be alarmed .\nAnd if you \u2019 re unvaccinated , you have some reasons to be alarmed .\nYou \u2019 ll experience severe illness in many cases.\n\u2019 \u2019 Biden then went on to encourage children to stay away from the unvaccinated , further stoking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This mass dehumanization by the establishment against people for their personal medical choices can not be ignored or understated .\nThis is the type of rhetoric that always lead to a two-tiered society in which the dehumanized sect suffers immensely under the authoritarians .\nIndeed , this mass suffering has already begun in many parts of the world .\nThis is why anti-lockdown protesters have taken to the streets across the planet to protest the lockdown tyrants .\nAnd how do the lockdown tyrants respond ?\nThey impose more restrictions .\nClearly we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make decisions which benefit freedom and liberty .\nIt is time Americans and the rest of the world realize that freedom is not some commodity to be traded in exchange for our obedience .\nFreedom , true freedom , is inalienable .\nIt \u2019 s time we act that way .", "author": "HAF", "url":

fashion with a pair of private space launches spearheaded by Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos .\nLike Musk , Bezos in particular has long professed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safeguard humanity .\nIn an article for The Guardian published in July , the Oxford historian Thomas Moynihan \u2019 s response was to lampoon Silicon Valley \u2019 s obsession , arguing that aspiring \u201c space barons \u201d like Musk and Jeff Bezos are abdicating responsibility for sublunar crises here on Earth .\nHis book , X-Risk : How Humanity Discovered Its Own Extinction , more meticulously locates this obsession within a longer history .\nLike much of his other public writing , it traces how our species \u201c discovered its own extinction.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wildly Panglossian \u2014 within a few pages it becomes apparent that he shares the techno-optimism of the very space tycoons he criticizes .\nAlthough he is at pains to argue that existential risk \u201c can not be rejected as a Silicon Valley fad , \u201d he nonetheless traffics in tried-and-true Silicon Valley rhetoric : that we must enthusiastically embrace promising new technologies to realize \u201c the full scope of our potential \u201d as a species .\n( Moynihan is the Future of Humanity Institute \u2019 s informal in-house historian , surely no accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he tells us that the \u201c discovery \u201d of human extinction was the ultimate triumph of Enlightenment rationalism .\nThanks to a series of intellectual breakthroughs \u2014 and growing awareness that the cosmos might be devoid of intelligent life \u2014 modern science and Enlightenment philosophy confronted the fact that human survival is not preordained .\nWe alone can secure our future : \u201c Remember , the human is a being whose vocation [ \u2026 ] is to liberate itself from its own extinction , \u201d he intones .\nYet , while X-Risk represents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species \u2019 s potential demise \u2014 spanning centuries , academic disciplines , and national borders \u2014 Moynihan \u2019 s history also contains a glaring , dangerous , and obviously intentional omission : the word \u201c eugenics \u201d does not appear once in 424 pages .\nThis is no mere oversight .\nHis book systematically glosses over the fact that human extinction was a hobbyhorse of the eugenics movement , and it has now reemerged as a fascination of the contemporary existential risk crowd , often rebranded as \u201c bioenhancement , \u201d \u201c transhumanism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Indeed , although he avoids the word \u201c eugenics , \u201d his desire to

his book .\nHe then writes : \u201c To truly assume maturity , perhaps , is to realize that we must leave Earth and our evolutionary past behind.\n\u201d Throughout X-Risk , he uses precisely such euphemisms .\nWhen discussing the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aficionado J .\nB. S. Haldane , for example , Haldane \u2019 s eugenicism is innocuously described as the \u201c daring task of redirecting our own evolution.\n\u201d Likewise , when Moynihan suggests that Haldane \u2019 s championing of \u201c ectogenesis \u201d \u2014 the artificial development of embryos outside the womb \u2014 actually anticipates the radical feminism of Shulamith Firestone , he conveniently fails to mention that Haldane conceived of ectogenesis as a tool for eugenic advancement .\nIt could be said that Musk \u2019 s intellectual antecedents are anxious British aristocrats who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago \u2014 many of whom were willing to consider extreme strategies \u00e0 la Musk .\nIn short , neither Musk \u2019 s nor the Oxbridge think tanks \u2019 interest is novel .\nIn the 19th-century Anglophone world , no single text did more to refashion thinking about human extinction than the publication of Darwin \u2019 s on The Origin of Species in 1859 .\nIt was often viewed as an \u201c outrage \u201d to humanity \u2019 s \u201c na\u00efve self-love \u201d ( as Freud famously described Darwin \u2019 s impact decades later ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darwin \u2019 s contemporaries and inheritors saw evolutionary science not as a scythe that cut humankind down to size but as heralding glorious possibilities for human supremacy .\nThey accepted the assertion that human beings are precarious animals vulnerable to extinction , but they rejected the idea that the human species is not uniquely privileged among organic beings .\nAfter all , we are the only animal capable of being paranoid about our evolutionary future , and potentially able to safeguard it .\nDarwin argued that extinction is mundane : a regular feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extinction boring \u2014 the result of unexceptional changes accumulating over vast stretches of time , rather than of unprecedented and uncontrollable upheavals ( as had previously been believed ) \u2014 evolutionary theory made it possible to view extinction as a long-term risk that might be anticipated , and thus strategized against , in advance .\nEarly Darwinian science fiction featured the looming threat of interspecies competition , but in fact many mainstream British intellectuals believed that the greatest danger to human survival might be the human species itself .\nDarwin \u2019 s cousin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and fear , kicking off the eugenics movement with his 1883 book , Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development .\nIn the decades to follow , Galton \u2019 s movement would establish a particularly strong foothold in the United States , where it was dominated by a noxious combination of economic anxiety and racialized nativism .\nIt was British eugenics that was marked by grander ambitions .\nThe English physician Caleb Saleeby spoke in 1909 for a growing number of British intellectuals when he declared that \u201c eugenics is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly coalesce after World War I into the paranoid worldview that inflects existential risk discourse today : the belief that the human species is the only species that has evolved to bear the moral imperative of survival , whatever the cost .\nIn 1923 , J .\nB. S. Haldane wrote a short book , Daedalus ; or , Science and the Future .\nThe first installment in the English publisher Kegan Paul \u2019 s infamous \u201c To-day and To-morrow \u201d series , it imagines a future remade by eugenic enhancement .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there can be little doubt that civilization would have collapsed [ \u2026 ] owing to the greater fertility of the less desirable members of the population in almost all countries , \u201d writes Haldane .\nThe book ends with an unsettling prediction : \u201c The scientific worker of the future will more and more resemble the lonely figure of Daedalus as he becomes conscious of his ghastly mission , and proud of it.\n\u201d The following year , the prominent Oxford philosopher F. C. S. Schiller would pen the next \u201c To-day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or The Future of Man , he warns that humanity \u2019 s \u201c future has always been precarious [ \u2026 ] because it has always been uncertain whether [ our species ] would use its knowledge well or ill , to improve or to ruin itself.\n\u201d Biological knowledge \u2014 politically mediated through eugenics \u2014 promised a means by which this improvement might be achieved and existential ruin avoided .\nAnthony Ludovici , a fellow British philosopher and translator of Nietzsche , would similarly maintain that the stakes of

woman \u201d in which he opined that birth control should ideally be replaced by \u201c some kind of controlled and legalized infanticide.\n\u201d The year 1926 would prove a banner year for eugenicists .\nRonald Fisher , a major figure in the \u201c modern synthesis \u201d of Darwinian evolution and Mendelian genetics , would write an ambitious essay entitled , \u201c Eugenics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Decay of Civilizations ?\n\u201d which argued that guided evolution might hold the key to permanently safeguarding society from disaster .\nThese concerns were also taken up by the English schoolteacher Leonard Huxley .\nThe son of Thomas Huxley , Leonard would tarnish the family name with his book Progress and the Unfit , in which he compared Western Europe to declining Rome , with failing racial hygiene as the chief threat to the survival of England and perhaps human civilization itself .\nThis worry was likewise shared by Leonard Darwin , son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eugenics Society , who in 1925 warned that biological decay would drive civilizational collapse unless the reproduction of the unfit was curbed by eugenic means .\nAs the decade wound to a close , such pronouncements only grew more dire and disturbing .\nCharles John Bond , a doctor and euthanasia enthusiast , would deliver the 1928 Galton Lecture in which he proclaimed that the biologically feeble poor were akin to \u201c parasitic cancer cells \u201d that threatened humanity by out-reproducing the wealthy .\nAssuming that \u201c civilized \u201d temperament and fecundity were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fertility of the elites \u201c might prove to be the deciding factor in race survival in the future.\n\u201d As for the lower classes ?\n\u201c We ought to welcome the extinction of the degenerate race , \u201d Bond counseled .\nOlaf Stapledon , the prodigiously talented author of a number of eugenics-soaked sci-fi masterpieces \u2014 much admired by Moynihan in X-Risk \u2014 would deliver a national broadcast on \u201c The Remaking of Man \u201d in 1931 .\nThe address waxed in rapturous fashion about our possible eugenic futures while also warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily disinfect the earth of the microbe , man.\n\u201d In a modestly titled 1934 tract If I Were Dictator , Stapledon \u2019 s friend and esteemed biologist Julian Huxley \u2014 son of Leonard , brother of the novelist Aldous \u2014 continued this line of inquiry .\nThere , the biologist argued that , while \u201c evolution [ \u2026 ] may go backwards , or spread sideways [ \u2026 ] or become fossilized , \u201d human intelligence spares us of this fate .\n\u201c Other organisms are the passive subjects of evolutionary forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man can become the conscious trustee of Evolution.\n\u201d Two years after this pronouncement , in his own Galton Lecture , Huxley would ominously declare that if eugenics was not widely adopted : \u201c [ W ] e can be sure of this alarming fact .\n[ \u2026 ] Humanity will gradually destroy itself.\n\u201d Less than a decade later , in a bid to end a world war marked by the deranged application of eugenics , two bombs would fall out of a clear blue Japanese sky , ushering humanity exponentially closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fleshing out this partial history of existential risk \u2019 s entanglement with eugenics , my aim is not to paint contemporary x-risk researchers as mustache-twirling villains .\nI had the pleasure of speaking on a panel with Moynihan a few years ago \u2014 he came across as thoughtful , modest , and unlikely to be engaged in a malicious conspiracy .\nLikewise , it seems a stretch to suggest that Nick Bostrom \u2019 s philosophy \u201c contains all the ingredients necessary for a genocidal catastrophe , \u201d as the philosopher Phil Torres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Current Affairs .\nWhat I am saying , though , is that we can not claim to take existential risk seriously \u2014 and meaningfully confront the grave threats to the future of human and nonhuman life on this planet \u2014 if we do not also confront the fact that our ideas about human extinction , including how human extinction might be prevented , have a dark history .\nAlthough eugenics was not a univocal movement \u2014 in Britain or internationally \u2014 the thinkers I highlight above all tended to share the assumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with genetics ) marked a turning point , a view shared by most x-risk scholars .\nThis fact bears scrutiny , especially given the growing penetration of tech billionaires into this x-risk space .\nIn the broadest terms , people like Moynihan , Bostrom , and even Musk are united by conviction that we \u2014 or , rather , they \u2014 have a profound moral imperative to prevent human extinction and provide a livable world for far-future human beings .\nThese are laudable aims .\nYet , we should also remember that many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haldane was a staunch anti-imperialist who died an Indian citizen , and Julian Huxley was a vocal opponent of racialized eugenics who spoke vociferously against the Nazi program .\nMany of them viewed their work as part of the struggle against capitalistic inequality , and yet they also believed in the liberatory potential of eugenics .\nAny history that attempts to enlist them as Moynihan does in the fight against human extinction must reckon with this complicated legacy .\nToday , \u201c man \u201d is no longer the \u201c political animal , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human species has become the paranoid animal : the only form of intelligent life able to fear for its future , and now hypothetically ( at least according to x-riskers like Musk ) capable of using that fear to secure its long-term survival .\nIt remains to be seen whether human beings at large are capable of leveraging this paranoia in the service of a just future \u2014 for those currently inhabiting a rapidly warming Earth as well as those to come \u2014 or whether \u201c the good of the species \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the elite who desire a world remade in their own image .\nIn any case , any attempt to secure a future must aim to learn from past hubris .\nHere , it is again worth recalling Julian Huxley , who delivered a speech at Madison Square Garden not long after human shadows were transposed onto Hiroshima concrete .\nSpeaking to an audience of some 18,000 assembled there for a \u201c crisis meeting \u201d on nuclear weapons , the biologist radiated optimism .\nIn a marked departure from his earlier premonitions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the species might yet be saved from existential peril by repurposing the split atom for the common good .\nA few hundred atomic bombs might usefully be dropped on the \u201c polar regions , \u201d Huxley cheerfully advised the crowd

prioritized AI development in recent years , making it a \u201c key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AI into many aspects of ordinary life , not only to surveil and control its people but also to use its massive population to spur development .\nTo bolster the rapid development of AI , the CCP has issued a number of supporting policies and regulations , including its \u201c Made in China 2025 \u201d and \u201c 13th Five-Year Plan.\n\u201d In 2017 , China \u2019 s State Council issued the \u201c New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan , \u201d emphasizing the significance of AI in

confront it .\n\u201c Dissociating from your body and denying what it is , and then framing it as some kind of enlightened state\u2026 it \u2019 s really twisted.\n\u201d Strong words that will chime with many from home birth attendant Isabella Malbin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of midwives , doulas , and nurses speaking out about what they see as a trans takeover of the birthing world .\nA recently launched UK-based Twitter account , Sex Not Gender Nurses and Midwives , has provided a forum to get their point across .\nBut the reality for many health professionals is that talking publicly is difficult , because of a fear of either being ostracised or going against their training .\nTo get an idea of the pressures they face , RT spoke to Isabella , who is a firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countered .\nIronically , her views have gone through quite a transformation since she began her doula training in 2016 in her home town , New York City .\nShe said , \u201c Like most women getting into birth work and women \u2019 s health , I have a very sincere desire to improve the lives of women , girls and children .\nNot anyone goes into such a politicised space where there is so much work that needs to be done .\nI went into that space with the intention to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , starting at birth.\n\u201d Aged 24 and keen to embrace modernity , Malbin was unsurprised that the first part of her training was not focused on medical matters , and instead was called \u2018 Cultural Competency \u2019 .\nThat meant she and her fellow students were taught to erase the words \u2018 mother \u2019 and \u2018 woman \u2019 from their professional vocabulary .\nThe replacements were : \u2018 birthing bodies \u2019 , \u2018 birthing people \u2019 , \u2018 menstruater \u2019 , \u2018 people who bleed \u2019 , and \u2018 chestfeeder \u2019 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ from New York City , I went to art school\u2026 you didn \u2019 t have to say much more ; I was on board .\nI couldn \u2019 t at the time understand how it would hurt anyone .\nI really couldn \u2019 t come up with any reasoning or examples why it would take anything away from me as a woman or women [ in general ] to use that language.\n\u201d As she was so intent on trying to be as good a doula as possible , Malbin didn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tone made it clear how objections would be framed .\n\u201c It was delivered as : \u2018 if you \u2019 re not on board , you have some inner work to do \u2019 , \u201d she said .\n\u201c Around that time some elder midwives wrote a letter about the danger of gender-neutral language .\nMy trainer brought it up as this horrible , shameful thing that had gone on in the birth world , that there was this group of midwives opposing this \u2018 new speak \u2019 .\nImmediately I learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gained her qualification and began delivering training sessions to couples expecting children , using the language that she had been told to use .\nHer website and professional materials didn \u2019 t contain the words \u2018 mother \u2019 or \u2018 woman \u2019 .\nNow she reflects upon what her clients must have felt as she avoided those words in the classes .\n\u201c I would be in a room with 12 couples coming to me for childbirth education and not a single woman in the room thought she was a man \u2013 yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 birthing people \u2019 .\nIt was really unbelievable and I did that for three years , \u201d she explained .\n\u201c If they felt it was strange \u2013 as I am sure most of them did \u2013 no one ever said anything to me .\nI imagine if they did think this was weird , they didn \u2019 t want to offend me or create a discord within the relationship.\n\u201d Finally , there was a crack in the dam and Malbin questioned the language politics when a Caesarean section was referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nShe said , \u201c It \u2019 s Orwellian and it doesn \u2019 t make sense ; everybody knows a C-section is not just a belly birth .\nWho are we trying to protect here ?\nThat is a marketing thing that I see only benefits the hospitals who are selling these belly births.\n\u201d \u201c Any women who has had a C-section knows it is a major abdominal surgery , and any women who has gone to have a vaginal birth after a C-section knows they are not the same .\nSo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nWho does it serve to constantly make these concessions with our language ?\n\u201d From then on , Malbin decided to revert to using the language that she personally felt was right and abandoned the \u2018 Cultural Competency \u2019 of her training .\nThat has come at a cost , as at a later training course she was kicked out for refusing to ignore the terms \u2018 mother \u2019 and \u2018 woman \u2019 , despite explaining that she accepted if other students felt differently .\nShe said , \u201c I was reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a program who called for a gender forum .\n[ Then ] A psychologist did a role-play of a man who thinks he is a woman begging me to let him into my women \u2019 s circle.\n\u201d \u201c I said , \u2018 I \u2019 m really sorry to hear you \u2019 re dealing with all these things , but you are not a woman and this is a \u2018 women only \u2019 space , so get the help you need but you are not welcome here \u2019 .\nThat sounds very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u2019 s insane that is the case.\n\u201d According to Malbin , this is a common situation \u2013 where female health professionals involved in births can \u2019 t voice an opinion that disagrees with trans ideology .\nColleagues and others online describe it as like having nowhere to turn .\n\u201c They are not free to speak , they are not given an open forum , they are plucked out quicker than you can say \u2018 trans ideology \u2019 , \u201d said Malbin .\n\u201c I get messages and emails from women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they can \u2019 t speak out or they were ostracised .\nThere is no kind of democratic space or nuanced space where women can talk about these issues .\nThis ideology is authoritarian and if you even question one part , you are instantly deemed transphobic.\n\u201d Alongside the midwives , doulas , and home birth attendants , mothers ( and fathers ) are also impacted by the use of gender-neutral language .\nMost arrive at hospitals or birthing centres happy to take their lead from the professionals .\nSo it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are struck by being referred as to as a \u2018 menstruater \u2019 or \u2018 chestfeeder \u2019 .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve had women come to me and say , \u2018 I don \u2019 t feel a connection with my midwife because she believes in this ideology \u2019 , \u201d said Malbin .\n\u201c What we are already dealing with in birth is a very deindividualised experience where the woman is one of many .\nIt \u2019 s like a conveyor belt\u2026 she comes in , she comes out .\nThen you are unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassed or hesitant to claim your body as a woman out of fear of triggering someone.\n\u201d The Billionaires Behind the LGBTQ & Transgender Agenda : George Soros , Peter Buffett , Tim Gill and the Stryker Dynasty Have Donated HUNDREDS of Millions to the Cause .\nThere \u2019 s also the reality that some women may feel uncomfortable being examined by a man .\nThey may be surprised when someone with a female name arrives at their bedside but is in a fact a man identifying as a woman .\nMalbin continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s an issue to have medical professionals who are male pretending to be women , inserting themselves literally into the inside of women \u2019 s bodies .\n\u201c I already take issue with

was in the \u201c last lap \u201d of the rough draft of a novel , describing it as \u201c a most dreadful mess.\n\u201d Orwell had sequestered himself on the Scottish island of Jura in order to finish the novel .\nHe completed it the following year , having transformed his \u201c most dreadful mess \u201d into \u201c 1984 , \u201d one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novels .\nPublished in 1949 , the novel turns 73 this year .\nThe anniversary provides an opportunity to reflect on the novel \u2019 s significance and its most valuable but sometimes overlooked lesson .\nThe main lesson of \u201c 1984 \u201d is not \u201c Persistent Surveillance is Bad \u201d or \u201c Authoritarian Governments Are Dangerous.\n\u201d These are true statements , but not the most important message .\n\u201c 1984 \u201d is at its core a novel about language ; how it can be used by governments to subjugate and obfuscate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a master of the English language and his legacy lives on through some of the words he created .\nEven those who haven \u2019 t read \u201c 1984 \u201d know some of its \u201c Newspeak.\n\u201d \u201c 1984 \u201d provides English speakers with a vocabulary to discuss surveillance , police states and authoritarianism , which includes terms such as \u201c Big Brother , \u201d \u201c Thought Police , \u201d \u201c Unperson \u201d and \u201c Doublethink , \u201d to name a few .\nThe authoritarian government of Orwell \u2019 s Oceania doesn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeks to make even thinking about dissent impossible .\nWhen Inner Party member O \u2019 Brien tortures \u201c 1984 \u2019 s \u201d protagonist , Winston Smith , he holds up his hand with four fingers extended and asks Smith how many fingers he sees .\nWhen Smith replies , \u201c Four !\nFour !\nWhat else can I say ?\nFour !\n\u201d O \u2019 Brien inflicts excruciating pain .\nAfter Smith finally claims to see five fingers , O \u2019 Brien emphasizes that saying \u201c Five \u201d is not enough ; \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no use .\nYou are lying .\nYou still think there are four.\n\u201d Orwell \u2019 s own name inspired an adjective , \u201c Orwellian , \u201d which is widely used in modern political rhetoric , albeit often inappropriately .\nIt \u2019 s usually our enemies who are acting Orwellian , and it \u2019 s a testament to Orwell \u2019 s talents that everyone seems to think \u201c 1984 \u201d is about their political opponents .\nThe political left sees plenty of Orwellian tendencies in the White House and the criminal justice system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Police \u201d on college campuses and social media companies turning users into \u201c Unpersons.\n\u201d But politicians can lie without being Orwellian , and a private company closing a social media account is nothing like a state murdering someone and eliminating them from history .\nLikewise , perceived academic conformity might be potentially stifling , but it \u2019 s hardly comparable to a conformity enforced by a police state that eliminates entire words from society .\nYet when U.S. government officials use terms such as \u201c enhanced interrogation , \u201d \u201c alternative facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or \u201c extremists \u201d they understand that what they \u2019 re describing is actually \u201c torture , \u201d \u201c lies , \u201d \u201c innocent civilian deaths \u201d and \u201c political dissidents.\n\u201d They prefer it if others , especially the press , used and believed in Orwellian language that dehumanizes enemies of the government and makes their horrific violence sound tolerable or even justified .\nWe see far more nefarious and barbaric distortions of language abroad .\nAccording to reports by activists and researchers , the Chinese state has put about 1 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethnic group \u2014 in \u201c re-education \u201d camps .\nReports reveal that the camps are hardly schools .\nThey \u2019 re brutal indoctrination sites , with inmates forced to recite Communist Party propaganda and renounce Islam .\nNorth Korea , the country that comes closest to embodying \u201c 1984 , \u201d has hampered its citizens \u2019 abilities to think for themselves with a disheartening measure of success .\nIn her memoir , North Korean defector Yeonmi Park describes discovering the richness of South Korea \u2019 s vocabulary , noting \u201c When you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you increase your ability to think complex thoughts.\n\u201d It \u2019 s hardly surprising that when Park read Orwell \u2019 s classic allegorical novel \u201c Animal Farm \u201d she felt as if Orwell knew where she was from .\nOrwell was not a prophet , but he identified a necessary feature of any successful authoritarian government .\nTo control you effectively it can \u2019 t merely threaten death , imprisonment or torture .\nIt \u2019 s not enough for it to ban books and religions .\nAs long as the state doesn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s under constant risk of overthrow .\nWe shouldn \u2019 t fear the U.S. turning

.\nThe \u201c experts \u201d and \u201c authorities \u201d are finally acknowledging that the \u201c Covid deaths \u201d and \u201c hospitalization \u201d statistics are artificially inflated and totally unreliable ( which they have been from the very beginning ) , and they are admitting that their miracle \u201c vaccines \u201d don \u2019 t work ( unless you change the definition of the word \u201c vaccine \u201d ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few people , or maybe more than a few people , and that lockdowns were probably \u201c a serious mistake.\n\u201d I am not going to bother with further citations .\nYou can surf the Internet as well as I can .\nThe point is , the \u201c Apocalyptic Pandemic \u201d PSYOP has reached its expiration date .\nAfter almost two years of mass hysteria over a virus that causes mild-to-moderate common-cold or flu-like symptoms ( or absolutely no symptoms whatsoever ) in about 95 % of the infected and the overall infection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % to 0.5 % , people \u2019 s nerves are shot .\nWe are all exhausted .\nEven the Covidian cultists are exhausted .\nAnd they are starting to abandon the cult en masse .\nIt was always mostly just a matter of time .\nAs Klaus Schwab said : \u201c the pandemic represent [ ed ] a rare but narrow window of opportunity to reflect , reimagine , and reset our world.\n\u201d It isn \u2019 t over , but that window is closing , and our world has not been \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not irrevocably , not just yet .\nClearly , GloboCap underestimated the potential resistance to the Great Reset , and the time it would take to crush that resistance .\nAnd now the clock is running down , and the resistance isn \u2019 t crushed \u2026 on the contrary , it is growing .\nAnd there is nothing GloboCap can do to stop it , other than go openly totalitarian , which it can \u2019 t , as that would be suicidal .\nAs I noted in a recent column : \u201c New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of totalitarianism \u2014 can not display itself as totalitarianism , or even authoritarianism .\nIt can not acknowledge its political nature .\nIn order to exist , it must not exist .\nAbove all , it must erase its violence ( the violence that all politics ultimately comes down to ) and appear to us as an essentially beneficent response to a legitimate \u2018 global health crisis \u2019 \u2026 \u201d The simulated \u201c global health crisis \u201d is , for all intents and purposes , over .\nWhich means that GloboCap has screwed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you intend to keep the masses whipped up into a mindless frenzy of anus-puckering paranoia over an \u201c apocalyptic global pandemic , \u201d at some point , you have to produce an actual apocalyptic global pandemic .\nFaked statistics and propaganda will carry you for a while , but eventually people are going to need to experience something at least resembling an actual devastating worldwide plague , in reality , not just on their phones and TVs .\nAlso , GloboCap seriously overplayed their hand with the miracle \u201c vaccines.\n\u201d Covidian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d would protect them from infection .\nEpidemiology experts like Rachel Maddow assured them that they would : \u201c Now we know that the vaccines work well enough that the virus stops with every vaccinated person , \u201d Maddow said on her show the evening of March 29 , 2021 .\n\u201c A vaccinated person gets exposed to the virus , the virus does not infect them , the virus can not then use that person to go anywhere else , \u201d she added with a shrug .\n\u201c It can not use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go get more people.\n\u201d And now they are all sick with\u2026 well , a cold , basically , or are \u201c asymptomatically infected , \u201d or whatever .\nAnd they are looking at a future in which they will have to submit to \u201c vaccinations \u201d and \u201c boosters \u201d every three or four months to keep their \u201c compliance certificates \u201d current , in order to be allowed to hold a job , attend a school , or eat at a restaurant , which , OK , hardcore cultists are fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who have been complying , not because they are delusional fanatics who would wrap their children \u2019 s heads in cellophane if Anthony Fauci ordered them to , but purely out of \u201c solidarity , \u201d or convenience , or herd instinct , or\u2026 you know , cowardice .\nMany of these people ( i.e.\n, the non-fanatics ) are starting to suspect that maybe what we \u201c tin-foil-hat-wearing , Covid-denying , anti-vax , conspiracy-theorist extremists \u201d have been telling them for the past 22 months might not be as crazy as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rationalizing , revising history , and just making up all kinds of self-serving bullshit , like how we are now in \u201c a post-vaccine world , \u201d or how \u201c the Science has changed , \u201d or how \u201c Omicron is different , \u201d in order to avoid being forced to admit that they \u2019 re the victims of a GloboCap PSYOP and the worldwide mass hysteria it has generated .\nWhich\u2026 fine , let them tell themselves whatever they need to for the sake of their vanity , or their reputations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Twitter revolutionaries .\nIf you think these \u201c recovering \u201d Covidian Cult members are ever going to publicly acknowledge all the damage they have done to society , and to people and their families , since March 2020 , much less apologize for all the abuse they heaped onto those of us who have been reporting the facts \u2026 well , they \u2019 re not .\nThey are going to spin , equivocate , rationalize , and lie through their teeth , whatever it takes to convince themselves and their audience that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they didn \u2019 t click heels and go full \u201c Good German.\n\u201d Give these people hell if you need to .\nI feel just as angry and betrayed as you do .\nBut let \u2019 s not lose sight of the ultimate stakes here .\nYes , the official narrative is finally crumbling , and the Covidian Cult is starting to implode , but that does not mean that this fight is over .\nGloboCap and their puppets in government are not going to cancel the whole \u201c New Normal \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never happened , and gracefully retreat to their lavish bunkers in New Zealand and their mega-yachts .\nTotalitarian movements and death cults do not typically go down gracefully .\nThey usually go down in a gratuitous orgy of wanton , nihilistic violence as the cult or movement desperately attempts to maintain its hold over its wavering members and defend itself from encroaching reality .\nAnd that is where we are at the moment\u2026or where we are going to be very shortly .\nCities , states , and countries around the world are pushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society , despite the fact that there is no longer any plausible justification for it .\nAustria is going ahead with forced \u201c vaccination.\n\u201d Germany is preparing to do the same .\nFrance is rolling out a national segregation system to punish \u201c the Unvaccinated.\n\u201d Greece is fining \u201c unvaccinated \u201d pensioners .\nAustralia is operating \u201c quarantine camps.\n\u201d Scotland .\nItaly .\nSpain .\nThe Netherlands .\nNew York City .\nSan Francisco .\nToronto .\nThe list goes on , and on , and on .\nI don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen .\nI \u2019 m not an oracle .\nI \u2019 m just a satirist .\nBut we are getting dangerously close to the point where GloboCap will need to go full-blown fascist if they want to finish what they started .\nIf that happens , things are going to get very ugly .\nI know , things are already ugly , but I \u2019 m talking a whole different kind of ugly .\nThink Jonestown , or Hitler \u2019 s final days in the bunker , or the last few months of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens to totalitarian movements and death cults once the spell is broken and their official narratives fall apart .\nWhen they go down , they try to take the whole world with them .\nI don \u2019 t know about you , but I \u2019 m hoping we can avoid that .\nFrom what I have heard and read , it isn \u2019 t much fun .", "author": "HAF", "url":

includes a link to a video from author/activist Mark Dice who talks about Project Blue Beam which uses what \u2019 s called the radio frequency hearing effect to beam and modulate non-directional voices into peoples \u2019 inner ears.7 Dice reminds us that in the 1980s US President Ronald Reagan suggested before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed an alien invasion to bring the world together by uniting to fight a common enemy .\nMike Adams \u2019 article also includes a link to a video by former Canadian Defense Minister Paul Hellyer who echoes a similar warning.8 Hellyer talks about the \u201c deep state \u201d power of corporations , intelligence agencies , US military , and weapons manufacturers whose \u201c collective power is incalculable .\nAnd their plan is an empire greater in size and power than any empire before it\u2026 .\nIt will end all government pretence of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt will be a dictatorship\u2026 of the privileged elite.\n\u201d In a New Dawn interview a few years ago with Ufologist Norio Hayakawa , he echoed the belief of Dr. Jacques Vallee that the UFO phenomenon is real but cautions us that we can not assume it has to do with extraterrestrial visitations.9 Hayakawa went on to suggest that , \u201c it could even be a momentary , holographic intrusion from some form of \u2018 parallel intelligence \u2019 \u2026 some form of \u2018 time-slip \u2019 , interdimensional \u2018 accident \u2019 .\nWe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present time , \u201d he said .\n\u201c The late Canadian investigative journalist Serge Monast\u2026 was the first to come up with the allegation [ in 1993 ] that NASA will develop this [ Project Blue Beam ] technology\u2026 .\nHAARP , which began to be talked about in the early 1990s , was basically another version of Project Blue Beam , utilising some of the Tesla technologies\u2026 .\n\u201c If there really exists a global cabal whose long-term plan is to enforce a global government , the most logical way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create an absolutely convincing need for such an authority.\n\u201d Hayakawa mentioned the work being done at Los Alamos , Sandia , White Sands , and Dulce , all in New Mexico .\nHe also reminded us of the related work of famous conspiracy theorist William \u2018 Bill \u2019 Cooper and of the claims of Robert \u2018 Bob \u2019 Lazar who says he took part in a top secret government project at Nevada \u2019 s Area 51 to reverse-engineer recovered ET spacecraft .\nChristopher L. Ruby , who calls himself a holistic visionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show , has a page on his website that addresses many ramifications of Project Blue Beam.10 He takes a religious bent in predicting one of the goals of the fake alien takeover will be to discredit organised religions in favour of a one world faith , thereby causing further religious wars on our planet wiping out a large segment of the population .\nHe points to media attempts to condition us to both fear ETs and submit to their takeover \u2013 programs such as the SciFi Channel \u2019 s 2002 Steven Spielberg 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Night Shyamalan science fiction thriller starring Mel Gibson about crop circles called Signs ; the Star Trek and Star Wars series ; and even the Stanley Kubrick film 2001 : A Space Odyssey .\nWhile such movies as Spielberg \u2019 s Close Encounters of the Third Kind ( 1977 ) and E.T .\n( 1982 ) , as well as the recent highly acclaimed Arrival stress peaceful communication with aliens , they can be contrasted with early films like The Day the Earth Stood Still ( 1951 ) and War of the Worlds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more recent Alien series of sci-fi horror movies , all of which scared the heck out of this writer , especially at a young age .\nWhile there are many more flicks I \u2019 ve not mentioned , perhaps the most obvious and glaring example of impending alien invasion is the movie Independence Day ( 1996 ) starring Will Smith .\nIn short , it \u2019 s becoming increasingly clear we \u2019 ve been conditioned to be afraid of extraterrestrials over a very long period of time .\nOn his website , Christopher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can cause earthquakes at specific points on the planet and that can erupt volcanoes .\nHe also describes how it \u2019 s now possible to produce gigantic \u201c space shows \u201d with 3-D optical holograms and sounds projected from satellites onto what \u2019 s called the sodium layer about 60 miles above Earth \u2019 s surface .\nThe sodium layer refers to a layer within the Earth \u2019 s mesosphere of unbound , non-ionized atoms of sodium that comes from the ablation of meteors .\nFrom an audio perspective , we know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been the subject of research since the 1970s .\nRuby quotes a researcher named G.F. Shapits who said back in 1974 that , \u201c \u2026the spoken words of the hypnotist may also be converted by electromagnetic energy directly to the subconscious part of the human brain without employing any mechanical device for receiving or transcoding the message , and without the person exposed to such influence having a chance to control the information input consciously.\n\u201d This possibly indicates that many of the mass shootings we have seen in recent decades are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be referred to as \u2018 Manchurian Candidates \u2019 .\nI believe it is safe to say those poor unfortunates can be presumed \u2018 Guinea Pigs \u2019 for testing these deplorable weapons .\nWhile we know the Soviets experimented a great deal with that kind of weaponry , it would be a mistake to think the Western powers as well as China have not also perfected and exploited such telepathic instruments .\nIn January 1991 the University of Arizona hosted a conference entitled \u201c The NATO Advanced Research Workshop on Current and Emergent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendees were warned about the potential abuse of their research findings.11 In fact , we now know there is equipment in operation at the CIA and the FBI that treats the human brain and neuro-muscular systems with ultra-low frequency radiation pulses .\nPerhaps it \u2019 s possible to make the blind see , the deaf hear , and the lame walk .\nBut we may never know .\nInstead , it is more likely that a statement made in an April 1970 Psychology Today article entitled \u201c Criminals Can Be Brainwashed \u2013 Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James V. McConnell is true.12 Dr. McConnell is quoted as saying , \u201c The day has come when we can\u2026 gain absolute control over an individual \u2019 s behaviour.\n\u201d Ruby \u2019 s website also points us to other work being done in this area : \u2022 Loral Electro-Optical Systems in Pasadena , California , has developed a transmitter for the US Air Force that broadcasts at the same frequency as the human nervous system .\n\u2022 The US Department of Defense has a number of publications on extremely low-frequency ( ELF ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prize nominee Dr. Robert Becker wrote a book entitled The Body Electric : Electromagnetism and the Foundation of Life which details the dangers to humans of electro-magnetic fields .\n\u2022 A 1978 book by James C. Lin , Ph.D. , called Microwave Auditory Effects and Application , describes research into pulse-modulated microwave-induced auditory effects .\n\u2022 Dr. Sidney Gottlieb , an American chemist and spymaster , was best known for his involvement in the 1950s and \u2018 60s with assassination attempts and the mind control program known as Project MK-Ultra .\nThe December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s Military Review featured an article by Lt. Col. John B. Alexander entitled \u201c The New Mental Battlefield : Beam Me Up , Spock \u201d in which he stated : \u201c If it is possible to feed artificial thought into the multigenic field via satellite , the mind control of the entire planet is now possible .\nAn individual \u2019 s only resistance would be to constantly question the motivation behind their thoughts and not act upon thoughts which they consider to be outside their own ideological , religious and moral boundaries.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Col. Alexander , who figures prominently in the 2004 movie about the US Army \u2019 s studies of military applications of the paranormal , entitled The Men Who Stare at Goats , gives us a hint of how we can try to combat the effects of such mind control operations ( re-read the italicised text above from Col. Alexander \u2019 s article ) .\nDr. Greer emphasises we must educate ourselves about the possibilities of these new weapons .\nFor instance , even though the level of classified holographic technology can now produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of Michael Jackson dancing on stage seen a couple of years after his death , we need not be fooled !\n\u201c Question everything , \u201d Greer implores .\nThe new technologies outlined above don \u2019 t have to be used in perpetual warfare .\nThey can be used for the benefit of mankind to provide unlimited amounts of energy that make obsolete dirty fossil fuels and nuclear power .\nOnly the few who control those sources of energy benefit from keeping us enslaved to them .\nPaul Hellyer claims we \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not a few years , to change .\nHe believes that if a critical mass of five million people read his book , The Money Mafia : A World in Crisis , change will start.13 In it , he recommends an end to private bankers \u2019 control of money by establishing a publicly owned US central bank ; full disclosure of the secret government ; acknowledging our real relationship to extraterrestrials ; the release of patents on free-energy systems ; a concerted effort to restore the oceans and the forests ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used for weather modification ( chemtrails ) like HAARP .\nBut , perhaps most important for all of us to see will be Dr. Greer \u2019 s next effort , Unacknowledged : An Expos\u00e9 of the Greatest Secret in Human History,14 a new movie that seeks to cover more of what we have discussed in this brief article , and give us additional mental ammunition to fight off Project Blue Beam or any other mind control weapons that are designed to fool us into believing we \u2019 re in danger of being invaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis article was published in New Dawn Special Issue Vol 11 No 2 .\nFootnotes : 3 .\nWatch the entire three hour talk at : www.youtube.com/watch ?\nv=VL0Rpy0Dhhs 4 .\n\u201c RED ALERT : The Asteroid Threat is Not What It Seems\u2026 THIS is What \u2019 s Really Happening !\n\u201d by IWB , 20 Feb 2013 , investmentwatchblog.com/red-alert-the-asteroid-threat-is-not-what-it-seems-this-is-whats-really-happening/ 5 .\n\u201c When Seeing and Hearing Isn \u2019 t Believing \u201d by William M.

\u201d by terrorists hoping to recruit support or plan attacks .\nIn this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be considered an extremist and will have their content reported to government agencies for further investigation or deleted .\nIn fact , the Justice Department is planning to form a new domestic terrorism unit to ferret out individuals \u201c who seek to commit violent criminal acts in furtherance of domestic social or political goals.\n\u201d What this will mean is more surveillance , more pre-crime programs , and more targeting of individuals whose speech may qualify as \u201c dangerous.\n\u201d The upshot of all of this editing , parsing , banning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language , what George Orwell referred to as Newspeak , which places the power to control language in the hands of the totalitarian state .\nUnder such a system , language becomes a weapon to change the way people think by changing the words they use .\nThe end result is mind control and a sleepwalking populace .\nIn totalitarian regimes \u2014 a.k.a .\npolice states \u2014 where conformity and compliance are enforced at the end of a loaded gun , the government dictates what words can and can not be used .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind a benevolent mask and disguises itself as tolerance , the citizens censor themselves , policing their words and thoughts to conform to the dictates of the mass mind lest they find themselves ostracized or placed under surveillance .\nEven when the motives behind this rigidly calibrated reorientation of societal language appear well-intentioned \u2014 discouraging racism , condemning violence , denouncing discrimination and hatred \u2014 inevitably , the end result is the same : intolerance , indoctrination and infantilism .\nThe social shunning favored by activists and corporations borrows heavily from the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a means of controlling its members .\nAs Dr. Steven Hassan writes in Psychology Today : \u201c By ordering members to be cut off , they can no longer participate .\nInformation and sharing of thoughts , feelings , and experiences are stifled .\nThought-stopping and use of loaded terms keep a person constrained into a black-and-white , all-or-nothing world .\nThis controls members through fear and guilt.\n\u201d Dr. Steven Hassan \u2019 s book , \u201c Combating Cult Mind Control , \u201d is available to purchase online .\nThis mind control can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result is an enslaved , compliant populace incapable of challenging tyranny .\nAs Rod Serling , creator of The Twilight Zone , once observed , \u201c We \u2019 re developing a new citizenry , one that will be very selective about cereals and automobiles , but won \u2019 t be able to think.\n\u201d The problem as I see it is that we \u2019 ve allowed ourselves to be persuaded that we need someone else to think and speak for us .\nAnd we \u2019 ve bought into the idea that we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shield us from that which is ugly or upsetting or mean .\nThe result is a society in which we \u2019 ve stopped debating among ourselves , stopped thinking for ourselves , and stopped believing that we can fix our own problems and resolve our own differences .\nIn short , we have reduced ourselves to a largely silent , passive , polarized populace incapable of working through our own problems and reliant on the government to protect us from our fears .\nAs Nat Hentoff , that inveterate champion of the First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quintessential difference between a free nation , as we profess to be , and a totalitarian state , is that here everyone , including a foe of democracy , has the right to speak his mind.\n\u201d What this means is opening the door to more speech not less , even if that speech is offensive to some .\nUnderstanding that freedom for those in the unpopular minority constitutes the ultimate tolerance in a free society , James Madison , the author of the Bill of Rights , fought for a First Amendment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the majority , ensuring that even in the face of overwhelming pressure , a minority of one \u2014 even one who espouses distasteful viewpoints \u2014 would still have the right to speak freely , pray freely , assemble freely , challenge the government freely , and broadcast his views in the press freely .\nWe haven \u2019 t done ourselves \u2014 or the nation \u2014 any favors by becoming so fearfully polite , careful to avoid offense , and largely unwilling to be labeled intolerant , hateful or closed-minded that we \u2019 ve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public discourse .\nWe have allowed our fears \u2014 fear for our safety , fear of each other , fear of being labeled racist or hateful or prejudiced , etc .\n\u2014 to trump our freedom of speech and muzzle us far more effectively than any government edict could .\nUltimately the war on free speech \u2014 and that \u2019 s exactly what it is : a war being waged by Americans against other Americans \u2014 is a war that is driven by fear .\nBy bottling up dissent , we have created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discontent that is now bubbling over and fomenting even more hate , distrust and paranoia among portions of the populace .\nBy muzzling free speech , we are contributing to a growing underclass of Americans who are being told that they can \u2019 t take part in American public life unless they \u201c fit in.\n\u201d The First Amendment is a steam valve .\nIt allows people to speak their minds , air their grievances and contribute to a larger dialogue that hopefully results in a more just world .\nWhen there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , frustration builds , anger grows , and people become more volatile and desperate to force a conversation .\nBe warned : whatever we tolerate now \u2014 whatever we turn a blind eye to \u2014 whatever we rationalize when it is inflicted on others will eventually come back to imprison us , one and all .\nEventually , \u201c we the people \u201d will be the ones in the crosshairs .\nAt some point or another , depending on how the government and its corporate allies define what constitutes \u201c hate \u201d or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d might all be considered guilty of some thought crime or other .\nWhen that time comes , there may be no one left to speak out or speak up in our defense .\nAfter all , it \u2019 s a slippery slope from censoring so-called illegitimate ideas to silencing truth .\nEventually , as George Orwell predicted , telling the truth will become a revolutionary act .\nWe are on a fast-moving trajectory .\nIn other words , whatever powers you allow the government and its corporate operatives to claim now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or because you like or trust those in charge , will eventually be abused and used against you by tyrants of your own making .\nThis is the tyranny of the majority against the minority marching in lockstep with technofascism .\nIf Americans don \u2019 t vociferously defend the right of a minority of one to subscribe to , let alone voice , ideas and opinions that may be offensive , hateful , intolerant or merely different , then we \u2019 re going to soon find that we have no rights whatsoever ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagree , protest , opt in , opt out , or forge our own paths as individuals ) .\nNo matter what our numbers might be , no matter what our views might be , no matter what party we might belong to , it will not be long before \u201c we the people \u201d constitute a powerless minority in the eyes of a power-fueled fascist state driven to maintain its power at all costs .\nWe are almost at that point now .\nOn paper \u2014 at least according to the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak .\nIn reality , however , we are only as free to speak as a government official \u2014 or corporate entities such as Facebook , Google or YouTube \u2014 may allow .\nThe steady , pervasive censorship creep that is being inflicted on us by corporate tech giants with the blessing of the powers-that-be threatens to bring about a restructuring of reality straight out of Orwell \u2019 s 1984 , where the Ministry of Truth polices speech and ensures that facts conform to whatever version of reality the government propagandists embrace .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead , as I make clear in my book Battlefield America : The War on the American People and in its fictional counterpart The Erik Blair Diaries , it is being used as a dystopian instruction manual for socially engineering a populace that is compliant , conformist and obedient to Big Brother .\nThe police state could not ask for a better citizenry than one that carries out its own censorship , spying and policing .", "author": "HAF", "url": "https://humansarefree.com/2022/01/cancel-culture-war-on-free-speech.html", "published": "Wed, 26 Jan 2022 11:00:29 +0000",

humanity has entered a new phase along its developmental journey .\nWe are now observing a grand restructuring of human society and its many systems : financial , technological , political , cultural , and more .\nI have already spoken about how this is creating great discomfort and dissonance for many people .\nThis is inevitable , for great upheavals are rarely smooth or without disturbances and ripples .\nA new phase is emerging as the current phase is fragmenting ; and like two stones thrown into a pond , they each create interference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here is where a person chooses to position themselves .\nA new way of life can be brought into being , yet it must be birthed from within the current one as it breaks up .\nFor a time , both worlds will co-exist in the same physical space although they shall occupy a different energetic space .\nWhere a person can position themselves is to be in the world that is emerging yet not of the world that is on the way out .\nAlthough one phase has ended , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintaining this world , and they are desperately attempting to re-model it with a new facelift \u2013 as a technocracy .\nThere will be a stealthy attempt at a makeover , to present the \u2018 new future \u2019 in terms of an artificial , synthetic future .\nYet this is not an evolutionary future for humanity .\nThe new emerging world will remain organic , natural , and in biological balance .\nThis is the model that shall come forth \u2013 not a false future in shiny metal .\nWe should take heed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : \u201c You never change things by fighting the existing reality .\nTo change something , build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.\n\u201d We are here now to build a new model whilst existing within the current one that is fast becoming obsolete .\nThe power that the obsolete system , and its rulers , have over us depends upon our state of being ( level of frequency ) \u2013 that is , others can only \u2018 lord it \u2019 over us if we are existing energetically ( aka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The obsolete system wants for everyone to operate ( energetic state ) at its lower-level vibratory state .\nWe simply do not go there .\nWe have to secure and protect the most valuable thing to us \u2013 our consciousness .\nIn being better prepared for engaging with the changing world I suggest the following five aspects : i ) Conscious awareness ; ii ) Connection ; iii ) Communication ; iv ) Creation ; v ) Comprehension .\nI ) Conscious Awareness : to be aware of what is happening in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not to get dragged into or entangled with these events .\nAwareness is necessary , but only as a tool for self-knowledge \u2013 not to acquire more baggage from the world .\nII ) Connection : to find and discover other people who are on the \u2018 same wavelength \u2019 and who think and perceive like you .\nReach out , connect with others , even if you have never previously met .\nSend them a message online .\nShare your thoughts \u2013 strengthen one another \u2019 s energy states .\nNever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always other people out there who think and feel the same as you do .\nOlder social alliances will be breaking down .\nOld or existing friendships and bonds will be dissolving .\nThat \u2019 s okay \u2013 find new ones .\nRe-align your social alliances according to your new state of perception .\nIII ) Communication : Share your thoughts and ideas with others .\nState your truths .\nLet others know what position you have taken .\nDo not be cowered into silence or anonymity .\nAllow others to also find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and feelings .\nDo not be loud or go around shouting your views ; or , worse still , trying to persuade others to take your position .\nJust be confident to state your ideas when asked and to represent and communicate your own truths when necessary .\nBy communicating your position with the world outside of you , you shall also be strengthening the trust in yourself .\nIV ) Creation : be creative !\nDo not allow the events of the world to pacify or nullify you .\nDo not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of external uncertainties .\nIt is precisely at such times of dissolution and renewal that creativity is most needed .\nBeing creative does not only imply from an artistic point of view .\nNot everyone can be a painter or musician , etc .\nBut genuine creativity is about being resilient and finding new ways to do things .\nNew patterns of lifestyles ; different hobbies ; learning new skills ; preparing yourself physically , mentally , and emotionally .\nBeing creative means being adaptive during moments of change .\nV ) Comprehension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how it is affecting others .\nRecognize that there will be many conflicting points of view and opinions .\nAcknowledge that many people will not only choose not to agree with you but that they may even attack your views .\nDo not let this sway you from your own understanding and your faith and trust in yourself .\nUnderstand the full scope of the wider implications and allow others to have their own views so long as this does not impinge or trespass on yours .\nAnd if , later on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your way of understanding , be gracious to them and not judgmental .\nWe are all learning at our own pace .\nPerhaps these five \u2018 C-Ways \u2019 will assist as we each move ahead into the paths we have chosen at this time .\nIt is not necessary to have a full picture or to know exactly how the next years will be .\nFor now , it is enough to visualize that you are already in the world you wish to be , only that it hasn \u2019 t been built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 later will come the physical structures .\nImagine there are two boats upon the water , an old sinking one and a new one .\nPlace yourselves on the new one and know that you are there already , even though it looks empty and without a full crew .\nFor if you believe yourself to be remaining on the old , sinking boat you will spend too much of your energies worrying about how it is sinking and running around , desperately seeking for some unknown solutions .\nYet knowing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 the new Ark \u2013 you will feel more balanced and energized , ready for sailing when the waters become clearer .\nYou are already where you wish yourself to be \u2013 it \u2019 s just that the new structures haven \u2019 t yet materialized .\nBut energetically \u2013 vibrationally \u2013 you are already aligned with the new phase of the human path you have chosen .\nAs Buckminster Fuller also said : \u201c We are called to be architects of the future , not its victims.\n\u201d The new boat has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space for those with a new vision for the future .", "author": "HAF", "url":

imminent invasions , the Kremlin has quietly turned its sights on an altogether different target : pedophilia .\nImagine for a moment if Hollywood , the mainstream media and the three-letter federal agencies spent as much time and cash in the war against pedophiles as they do in their perennial propaganda war against Russia .\nAt the very least , the West would be fighting a real enemy and not one that has been concocted at some cluttered cubicle inside of the Ministry of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to Russia , the global spiritual superpower of last resort , to fight this worthy battle mostly alone .\nLast week , when many Western governments were trampling on the civil rights of their subjects due to a viral strain with a better than 99 percent survival rate , Russian lawmakers adopted \u2013 and without excessive fanfare and fainting spells \u2013 Law # 1248305-7 that imposes life imprisonment for \u201c crimes against the sexual integrity of minors.\n\u201d The document extends the maximum penalty of life imprisonment for pedophiles .\nCurrently in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously been convicted of violating a child under the age of 14 faces a life sentence .\nAccording to the updated legislation , which heads to the Kremlin next month for President Putin \u2019 s signature , a repeat offender found guilty of assaulting a minor above the age of 14 could receive a life sentence .\nThe Duma \u2019 s efforts to broaden the fight against pedophilia comes at a time when the world is struggling against a Western invasion of \u2018 progressive \u2019 thought that is totally at odds with what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is not to suggest that homegrown sexual deviants do not exist in Russia , or that Russia drafted these laws specifically with questionable Western values in mind .\nNevertheless , Russia is fully aware of the radical progressive tendencies that have begun devouring Western capitals .\nAnd as most people can appreciate , ideas have no respect \u2013 especially in the age of the internet \u2013 for national borders , nor do they require passports .\nMust-read : Putin \u2019 s Comments About Satanism & Pedophilia Within Western Politics Are Turning Out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past , most people \u2013 at least among the mentally stable \u2013 would agree that pedophilia is a crime of the highest magnitude against society \u2019 s most vulnerable members .\nNowadays , such a statement of \u2018 certainty \u2019 finds no shortage of cynical detractors .\nAlthough the Western world has not come out and pledged its allegiance to child molesters , or added a \u2018 P \u2019 to the LGBTQ+ parade , there are some unmistakable signs that such a day is just over the horizon .\nAlready we \u2019 ve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAs things stand , public libraries are proudly hosting ( taxpayer funded ) Drag Queen Story Hours ; a 13-year-old transgender boy named \u2018 Desmond is Amazing \u2019 is touted in the media as the ideal role model for children ; and medical practitioners are strongly discouraged from challenging those children who say they want to \u2018 transition \u2019 to the opposite sex , a decision involving hormones and surgical procedures that many people go on to regret later in life .\nWhether intentional or not , the Western establishment is slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very young children can make critical life decisions for themselves \u2013 up to and including what sex they may identify as ( an incredibly complicated and unproven concept that is oftentimes planted in young and impressionable minds courtesy of social media ) .\nThat \u2019 s not a very far leap from arguing that children should also reserve the right to decide at what age it is appropriate for them to enter into sexual relations , and with whomever they want .\nIn other words , there is no longer any need for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this bizarre new world order .\nThe mainstream media , Hollywood , public schools and social media have taken over the shop .\nThis slow-drip indoctrination process has been gathering momentum for a long time in various publications .\nIn 2017 , for example , BBC ran with an article entitled , \u2018 Paedophiles need help , not condemnation \u2013 I should know.\n\u2019 Here the reader is introduced to an anonymous 60-something male who opens his confessional by proclaiming : \u201c It \u2019 s a long time since I \u2019 ve

pedophilia , as opposed to being a mental affliction , is yet another harmless \u201c sexual orientation.\n\u201d Just so we \u2019 re all on the same page , the World Health Organization ( still ) lists pedophilia under the category of \u2018 Disorders of Sexual Preference.\n\u2019 Yet that has not stopped people who should know better from turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this month , USA Today published an article entitled , \u2018 What the public keeps getting wrong about pedophilia \u2019 where the boneheaded argument was made that a \u201c pedophile is an adult who is sexually attracted to children , but not all pedophiles abuse kids , and some people who sexually abuse kids are not pedophiles.\n\u201d Thankfully , the author did not attempt to explain exactly who or what child molesters are thought to be , but it \u2019 s probably safe to guess , considering the state of the modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere on the spectrum between \u2018 victim \u2019 and \u2018 martyr \u2019 .\nIn any case , it is clear where this game of linguistic gymnastics of turning predators into victims is heading .\nThe world must stand firm with Russia at this great turning point in history and demonstrate its intolerance to the ongoing effort to normalize the most egregious crime of them all .\nChildren deserve nothing less than society \u2019 s pledge of full protection .", "author":

in the middle of the night , transported to the quarantine camps in buses and held in isolation .\nIf this last scenario sounds chillingly familiar , it should .\nEighty years ago , another authoritarian regime established more than 44,000 quarantine camps for those perceived as \u201c enemies of the state \u201d : racially inferior , politically unacceptable or simply noncompliant .\nWhile the majority of those imprisoned in the Nazi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incarceration sites and ghettos were Jews , there were also Polish nationals , gypsies , Russians , political dissidents , resistance fighters , Jehovah \u2019 s Witnesses , and homosexuals .\nCulturally , we have become so fixated on the mass murders of Jewish prisoners by the Nazis that we overlook the fact that the purpose of these concentration camps were initially intended to \u201c incarcerate and intimidate the leaders of political , social , and cultural movements that the Nazis perceived to be a threat to the survival of the regime.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explains : \u201c Most prisoners in the early concentration camps were political prisoners \u2014 German Communists , Socialists , Social Democrats \u2014 as well as Roma ( Gypsies ) , Jehovah \u2019 s Witnesses , homosexuals , and persons accused of \u2018 asocial \u2019 or socially deviant behavior .\nMany of these sites were called

@ @ @ @ @ @ divides the populace into warring \u201c us vs. them \u201d camps \u2014 fail to take note of the looming danger that threatens to wipe freedom from the map and place us all in chains .\nIt \u2019 s about what happens when any government is empowered to adopt a comply-or-suffer-the-consequences mindset that is enforced through mandates , lockdowns , penalties , detention centers , martial law , and a disregard for the rights of the individual .\nThe slippery slope begins in just this way , with propaganda campaigns about the public good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it ends with lockdowns and concentration camps .\nThe danger signs are everywhere .\nClaudio Ronco , a 66-year-old Orthodox Jew and a specialist in 18th-century music , recognizes the signs .\nBecause of his decision to

the \u2018 national enemies \u2019 , without and within , that we had no time to think about these dreadful things that were growing , little by little , all around us.\n\u201d The German people chose to ignore the truth and believe the lie .\nThey were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around them .\nAs historian Robert Gellately points out : \u201c [ A ] nyone in Nazi Germany who wanted to find out about the Gestapo , the concentration camps , and the campaigns of discrimination and persecutions need only read the newspapers.\n\u201d The warning signs were there , blinking incessantly like large neon signs .\n\u201c Still , \u201d Gellately writes , \u201c the vast majority voted in favor of Nazism , and in spite of what they could read in the press and hear by word of mouth about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official anti-Semitism , and so on .\n\u2026 [ T ] here is no getting away from the fact that at that moment , \u2018 the vast majority of the German people backed him.\n\u2019 \u201d Half a century later , the wife of a prominent German historian , neither of whom were members of the Nazi party , opined : \u201c [ O ] n the whole , everyone felt well .\n\u2026 And there were certainly eighty percent who lived productively and positively throughout the time .\n\u2026 We also had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d In other words , as long as their creature comforts remained undiminished , as long as their bank accounts remained flush , as long as they weren \u2019 t being locked up , locked down , discriminated against , persecuted , starved , beaten , shot , stripped , jailed or killed , life

discriminated against , persecuted , starved , beaten , shot , stripped , jailed or killed , but it \u2019 s getting worse by the day for the rest of us .\nWhich brings me back to the present crisis : COVID-19 is not the Holocaust , and those who advocate vaccine mandates , lockdowns and quarantine camps are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makings of a slippery slope .\nThe means do not justify the ends : we must find other ways of fighting a pandemic without resorting to mandates and lockdowns and concentration camps .\nTo do otherwise is to lay the groundwork for another authoritarian monster to rise up

Truth About Masking", "content": "Except from Ian Miller \u2019 s new book : Unmasked : The Global Failure of Covid Mask Mandates .\nOn February 4 , 2020 , just a month before his 60 Minutes interview , and two months before the CDC , with Fauci \u2019 s support , changed their mask guidance , he received an email from Sylvia Burwell , who had previously worked as a secretary of Health and Human Services under President Obama .\nBurwell asked Fauci if she should bring a mask with her while traveling , to which he responded : \u201c Masks are really for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infection to people who are not infected rather than protecting uninfected people from acquiring infection.\n\u201d More importantly , he gave her one of the many scientifically based reasons why it wasn \u2019 t necessary : \u201c The typical mask you buy in the drug store is not really effective in keeping out virus , which is small enough to pass through the material .\nIt might , however , provide some slight benefit in keep [ ing ] out gross droplets if someone coughs or sneezes on you .\nI do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are several key points to highlight about his response , beginning with his statement that masks are not meant to provide protection to the wearer .\nAlthough this is consistent with the initial recommendation for the public to wear masks as a form of \u201c source control , \u201d the CDC and Fauci maintained that asymptomatic spread was the reason for recommending universal masking .\nBut as previously noted , asymptomatic spread is incredibly rare to nonexistent .\nIf symptomatic individuals or those in the very early stages of showing symptoms are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as multiple studies suggest , masks were never going to be effective at preventing asymptomatic cases from spreading to others .\nThe new recommendations were doomed to fail as soon as they were implemented .\nSecondly , and most notably , Fauci gave a specific explanation of the inherent flaws of masks purchased by the general public : that the virus is too small and passes right through the material .\nThis sentence alone illustrates the inescapable contradiction to his later statement on the lack of supply as his initial hesitation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based presumably on scientific evidence that he had seen and reviewed , was that masks do not work against viruses .\nHis assertion that masks might provide some slight benefit against droplets caused by coughing and sneezing is precisely the same argument used by the CDC and others to justify masking , but his previous statement negates that line of thinking entirely .\nIf masks stop some droplets but the virus is too small to be blocked , lab experiments purporting to prove mask efficacy are functionally useless .\nMechanistic laboratory simulations using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they stop droplets are measuring the wrong thing entirely .\nDr. Fauci knew pre-April 2020 that stopping droplets , the only thing that masks might potentially accomplish , won \u2019 t help due to the size of virus particles .\nHe said nothing about ensuring supply for health care workers , who would need masks for protection in their duty as frontline providers treating COVID patients .\nHe simply stated that masks are ineffective .\nConclusively , his final comment forcefully restated his point , \u201c I do not recommend that you wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Fauci knew about masking , and that is exactly what he said when questioned on 60 Minutes .\nUp until the CDC changed their guidance , Fauci \u2019 s thinking was entirely consistent .\nThen , suddenly , and without any significant shift in evidence base , his opinion dramatically flipped .\nHow can we be so sure that the evidence base didn \u2019 t change ?\nWell , because Fauci \u2019 s emails cover that as well .\nOn March 31 , just a few days before the CDC \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received an email from Andrea Lerner , another employee at NIAID and the National Institutes of Health .\nLerner confirmed what the entire scientific community already knew ; there was no evidence that masking reduced transmission of influenza-like illnesses : \u201c In addition , I found the attachedd [ sic ] review on masks that addresses use in the community settings .\nAttached are the paper and figure 3 , which summarizes the data from 9 very diverse RCTs ( overlapping with what I had sent earlier ) .\nBottom line [ sic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ILI/ URI/or flu rates when masks were used\u2026 \u201d Fauci knew masks didn \u2019 t work to prevent illnesses like COVID .\nHe knew that the evidence on masks hadn \u2019 t changed because one of his top employees confirmed that there was no positive impact from masking based on the gold standard of scientific research , randomized

experienced the horrors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t think they had to think about survival food storage or emergency preparedness like modern preppers .\nThe United Kingdom didn \u2019 t ration food until January 1940 while America only started rationing food until 1942 .\nThe suggestion to store food may have seemed strange to people living in 1939 , but by the time America was fully involved in WWII , the practice would benefit many people .\nHere are five important WWII lessons about food storage to remember and practice before SHTF : You can never have too much Wherever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can never have too many of the right foods .\nAs a prepper , you should build a food stockpile and start a home garden .\nThis ensures that you have access to both shelf-stable items and fresh fruits and vegetables .\nStock up on foods that will last a long time and can be used in different dishes .\nYou also need to learn how to cook from scratch .\nHere \u2019 s a list of food that you should stock up on before the stores run out when SHTF : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beef , salmon and tuna . )\n\u2022 Canned vegetables ( Such as beans , beets , corn , peas and tomatoes . )\n\u2022 Dairy and milk ( Like condensed milk or coconut milk . )\nIf you want to try growing your own food , here are some plants that are perfect for a survival garden : Build up your food storage supply now , not after rationing starts Don \u2019 t get complacent .\nWhile the threat of war may seem like something impossible in these modern times , preppers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ready for anything , such as natural disasters or long-term power outages .\nIf you are worried about your finances , start building your stockpile by purchasing an extra can of beans or tuna when getting the groceries .\nKeep doing this and soon , you \u2019 ll have enough extra food for a least one week .\nIn time , you will have enough for several weeks or even months .\nRemember , you don \u2019 t need to so spend all your money on extra supplies if you can \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can is more manageable .\nFood was rationed during WWII , but if you were prepared before SHTF , food supplies will be one less thing to worry about .\nNow , if your neighbors come to you asking for help in a survival scenario , give what you can spare but don \u2019 t talk about your stockpile to deter others from attempting to loot your house when SHTF .\nIf you have extra money , invest in other necessities Wartime food storage wasn \u2019 t just about food .\nBack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their money on important supplies that they couldn \u2019 t grow , make , or barter for .\nIf you have a large family , you may benefit from stocking up on other supplies like alcohol or tools so you can trade for other items that you will need when SHTF like clothing for your kids .\nYou will also need to stock up on other essentials like prescription medication , pet food , or cleaning supplies .", "author": "HAF", "url":

report is the newest in a long line of condemnations of lockdown .\nCOVID-19 confinement measures failed to save lives , according to the most thorough research ever released by one of the world \u2019 s most respected medical institutes .\nThe paper A Literature Review and Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Lockdowns on Covid-19 Mortality , co-authored by Jonas Herby of the Center for Political Studies in Denmark , Lars Jonung of Lund University in Sweden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was recently published in Johns Hopkins University \u2019 s Studies in Applied Economics .\nIt is a meta-analysis of 24 studies ( selected from a pool of over 18,000 ) that looked at how beneficial mobility and activity constraints were at lowering COVID mortality .\n\u201c While this meta-analysis concludes that lockdowns have had little to no public health effects , they have imposed enormous economic and social costs where they have been adopted , \u201d the authors conclude .\n\u201c In consequence , lockdown policies are ill-founded and should be rejected as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joakim Book , who reviewed the meta-analysis for the Brownstone Institute , the authors avoided both the downfalls of earlier

evidence for a certain hypothesis rather than comprehensively investigating how the full range of studies measure up.\n\u201d \u201c The best case we can make for lockdowns is that the minor impact they may have had in temporarily averting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the pain , the societal upheaval , the misery and human suffering that accompanied them , \u201d Book concludes .\n\u201c Is anyone responsible ever going to admit that policy error ?\n\u201d The report is the newest in a long line of condemnations of lockdown measures .\nIn April 2021 , Simon Fraser University economics professor Douglas Allen authored a study that found that although lockdowns saved 22,333 years of lost life , they also induced 6.3 million years of lost life , making the policy \u2019 s net long-term damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owing to the cumulative toll of cancelled or postponed care for other medical issues , as well as the mental distress of losing a loved one .\nIn October , Marine Baudin , J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Mercier , and Denis Rancourt published a study that credited most of the COVID casualty count in the United States to \u201c persistent chronic psychological stress induced by the long-lasting government-imposed societal and economic transformations during the COVID-era [ which ] converted the existing societal ( poverty ) , public-health ( obesity ) and hot-climate risk factors into deadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be misdiagnosed bacterial pneumonia deaths , \u201d according to the study , and also that the \u201c massive vaccination campaign\u2026 had no detectable mitigating effect , and may have contributed to making the younger population more vulnerable , \u201d possibly by inspiring extremely risky behavior through overstated perceptions of vaccine efficacy .\nIn recent times , leading members in the federal health bureaucracy who had previously championed \u201c devastating \u201d responses to lockdown naysayers had also stepped back with their more constrictive prescriptions , referencing the omicron variant , vaccine accessibility , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift instead of acknowledging any mistake in their prior stances .", "author": "HAF", "url":

Reset Agenda Has Failed \u2013 Is Ukraine Plan B?", "content": "There are people in the liberty movement that attribute FAR too much intelligence to the global power elites , to the point that they seem to think the globalists are always planning \u201c ten steps ahead.\n\u201d The funny thing about planning ten steps ahead though is that if anything goes wrong with steps 1-9 then getting to step number 10 will be impossible and you just wasted a whole lot of energy on an elaborate plan that ended up going nowhere .\nThe globalists are NOT the smartest people around ; not even close .\nThey aren \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually function and there are no surprises .\nTheir ideas fail constantly .\nThere is only one reason that centralizing criminals have not been brought down , and that is because no one has ever targeted them directly .\nEvery time there is a governmental shake up or rebellion or mass movement for change people target \u201c the system \u201d ; they blame the system for all our problems ( or they blame a handful of political puppets ) and they seek to add a fresh coat of paint or change some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the curtain always end up back behind the curtain .\nThe problem is never \u201c the system \u201d , it \u2019 s the people running and influencing the system while enjoying the comfort of the shadows .\nHere is how the globalists seem to operate the best that I can tell \u2013 They aim a fist full of darts at a board and throw as hard as they can and whatever sticks is what sticks .\nWhen a plan does stick , well the globalists appear to be brilliant , don \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just throwing around schemes blindfolded and half of those schemes landed in the gutter .\nThe problem is that while the globalists are fumbling around in the dark searching for a plan that works they can do a lot of damage and draw a lot of attention .\nEvery once in a while it becomes obvious when they have invested an immense amount of time and planning into a single unique scheme , a fulcrum point that many of their other plans will rely on in the future .\nThere is no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was meant to bulldoze over numerous social and legal conventions and achieve full bore centralization before the vast majority of people even knew what hit them .\nThe pure excitement and adrenaline on display by the globalists at the onset of the pandemic was palpable .\nThey were practically dancing in the streets , jabbering about how many worldwide socialist programs they were about to railroad through , not to mention how many individual liberties they were about to erase .\nThat said , when a plan doesn \u2019 t stick the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force it to work and this never goes well for them .\nWe \u2019 ve seen this multiple times with their attempts to institute gun control in the US and they have failed over and over again .\nMore recently , the covid agenda and by extension the globalist \u201c Reset \u201d has fallen apart in the US and this has led to problems for them in other parts of the world .\nAmerican resistance to the vax mandates and lockdowns was key to everything , more so than I think many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implement medical tyranny through much of the rest of the world , with conservative red states blocking the agenda at every turn this created a focal point for resistance .\nMeaning , all the people in the world can still see that there is another way to do things that does not involve authoritarianism .\nLife in the red states goes on as if covid barely existed .\nConservatives are not \u201c dying in the streets \u201d like the lunatic liberals said would happen .\nIn fact , millions of people have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states just to be free .\nWhen you offer people alternatives , you offer them a glimpse of freedom , and sometimes a glimpse is all that is needed to inspire rebellion .\nI believe that it was red state resistance that led directly to the Supreme Court blocking Biden \u2019 s illegal and unconstitutional vaccine mandates .\nIf the red states had not take such an aggressive stand , the whole country might be under Biden \u2019 s thumb right now as he hands out dictates from on high , or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s a coincidence that the UK government decided to remove all covid mandates right after the US Supreme Court dropped restrictions in the US .\nWhen freedom is visible it spreads .\nIt \u2019 s hard for western governments to explain to their people why they should be enslaved over the covid virus when so many other people across the ocean live their lives normally in the face of the same illness .\nThis doesn \u2019 t mean that some of the worst offenders will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their populations .\nIt would seem that the Australian government has been lost to globalist tyranny forever , but they still will not be able to deny the reality that conservative Americans are free .\nThere will always be a chance for revolt within Australia exactly because we are living proof that covid mandates do not need to exist .\nSince the very beginning of the covid pandemic I have argued that the virus itself was a lab engineered bioweapon , most likely created in the bowels of the Level 4 facilities in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is widely recognized as ground zero .\nI have also argued from the very beginning that evidence shows that the NIH and Anthony Fauci have been involved in the funding of manipulation of coronaviruses at the Wuhan Lab for many years .\nMeaning , there has been collusion between western elitists and Chinese scientists to weaponize covid through gain of function research .\nThis is now exposed as FACT .\nWhat I don \u2019 t know for certain is if the virus was released deliberately , or accidentally .\nWhat I can say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation held a \u201c simulation \u201d of a global coronavirus pandemic only two months before the real thing happened .\nThe simulation , called \u201c Event 201 \u201d , seemed to predict almost everything that would eventually happen with the real coronavirus outbreak that started in China , right down to news companies and social media giants locking down all information that didn \u2019 t fit the narrative .\nThere was just one problem \u2013 The virus wasn \u2019 t as deadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predicted 65 million initial deaths worldwide and the WHO predicted a much higher infection fatality rate of 3 % of the population or more .\nThis never happened .\nThe globalists and the media have been scrambling for the past couple years to convince the public that the death rate of covid is much higher higher than it is , but the fact remains that dozens of studies show covid \u2019 s average IFR is a mere 0.27 % .\nIt \u2019 s not going to change for the worse , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mutate into less deadly forms of itself .\nWhy did this happen ?\nIt \u2019 s impossible to say .\nMaybe the virus performed differently in the lab but then changed dramatically once it was let out into the wild ?\nThat would be my guess .\nMaybe it was divine intervention ?\nFor whatever reason , the globalists invested an intense amount of energy into the covid virus and it let them down , and now they are stuck trying to create mass panic over a nothing-burger .\nSo , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will need a distraction as a means to redirect momentum , and the globalists will do what they always do , which is create war tensions .\nThis does not mean that large scale war is the intended outcome , but limited regional wars that could grow into something more are always on the table .\nIt is not a mistake that the US could potentially be caught up in not one but two major regional conflicts at this time , including a Chinese invasion of Taiwan as well as a Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukraine is the most hyped .\nWe have seen such spill over with Ukraine many times in the past and it \u2019 s hard to say if this is yet another false start or if a full blown Russian attack is going to happen .\nWith constant US influence , funding and arming being pursued in the region I suppose getting the Russians to invade would not be that hard .\nI \u2019 m not really interested in trying to read the dice on this one .\nMy only interest in Ukraine is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ globalist agenda .\nFirst , the economic instability that has been growing exponentially the past couple years will now hit overdrive .\nInflation , gas prices , the supply chain , all the threats that are already looming over us will expand tenfold with two nuclear powers at odds .\nEven if Ukraine saber rattling was to choke out into nothing just the existence of the danger is enough to inspire widespread economic fear .\nSecond , the pandemic issue can be cast to the wayside with little fanfare .\nThe globalists know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need a way to exit without explaining the numerous lies they have peddled in the past two years .\nWar is a way to wipe the slate clean on the news cycle .\nThird , heightened tensions with Russia open the door to a different form of paranoia at home .\nHow many times have we heard media claims of \u201c Russian influence \u201d on US elections ?\nThere is ZERO proof of this , but the narrative has already been planted among leftists .\nIt would not surprise me in the slightest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the outcomes ignored because of unverified claims of Russian \u201c interference.\n\u201d What better way to prevent a complete conservative sweep in the US than to simply stop the elections altogether ?\nFourth , by extension , it is only a matter of time before a conservative rebellion arises in the US to unseat the globalists from power .\nIt is already happening in may forms today , for those who are paying attention .\nThe most common way for corrupt governments to undermine a rebellion for freedom is to accuse it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foreign enemy .\nThat is to say , the corrupt government seeks to take away the heart and soul of the rebellion by claiming they aren \u2019 t fighting for freedom , they are only fighting in exchange for money or power from a foreign nation .\nTheir reason for fighting is \u201c fake.\n\u201d We saw this with the Chinese CCP when they brutally took over Hong Kong .\nWe also saw this in Kazakhstan when the people rioted in the streets over price inflation and Russian troops were sent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign created color revolution.\n\u201d Nothing could have been further from the truth .\nMake no mistake , when the fighting starts in the US , our rebellion will not be called a fight for freedom .\nWe will be accused as \u201c Russian agents \u201d , traitors , insurrectionists , etc , etc..\nThey \u2019 ll say we \u2019 re fighting to support foreign governments , not to bring liberty and sanity back to our society .\nWe \u2019 ll be the villains ; it \u2019 s important to understand this and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warfare .\nIt is for this reason primarily that conflict with Russia makes a lot of sense for the globalists .\nPerhaps not on the scale of a global war , but enough to keep their prospective populations in line .\nWhether or not this plan succeeds is another matter entirely .\nAs already mentioned , these people fail regularly .", "author": "HAF", "url":

through their \u201c ultimate goal \u201d of getting everyone on the planet to take the \u201c lethal experimental injections.\n\u201d Fuellmich then pointed out how the WEF has captured world governments through it \u2019 s \u201c Young Global Leaders \u201d program to carry out its Great Reset agenda .\n\u201c Our governments are not our governments anymore , rather they have been taken

citing Bill Gates and former German Chancellor Angela Merkel as its first graduates .\nThe final pieces of the COVID puzzle involve \u201c population control \u201d and the dissolution of national sovereignty with the replacement of a One World Government and single currency , Fuellmich argued .\n\u201c This involves population control which , in their view , requires both a massive reduction of the population and manipulating the DNA of the remaining population with the help \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d Fuellmich said .\n\u201c But it also requires the deliberate destruction of democracy , of the rule of law , and of our constitutions through chaos so that ultimately , we will agree to losing our national and cultural identities and instead will accept a One World Government under the

the corporate media.\n\u201d On Saturday , February 5th , the committee convened to issue opening statements beginning with Dr. Reiner Fuellmich : During the course of the proceedings Dr. Fuellmich asserted the following : \u201c This case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed under the guise of a corona pandemic , looks complicated only at first glance.\n\u201d \u201c But when you put together all those

Fuellmich said , adduncing figures such as former German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Bill Gates as being among its first graduates .\nLater mentioning the tie-in of the eugenics agenda ; \u201c This involves population control which , in their view , requires both a massive reduction of the population and manipulating the DNA of the remaining population with the help \u2013 for example \u2013 of mRNA experimental injections.\n\u201d And the replacement of national sovereignty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; \u201c But it also requires the deliberate destruction of democracy , of the rule of law , and of our

the coming weeks .\nIncluding former military insider James Bush , investigative journalist Whitney Webb , former employees of the World Health Organization , British intelligence officials , and others to explain the historical and geopolitical significance of the ongoing crisis .\nBeginning with Operation Dark Winter , and continuing into the Rockefeller Lockstep Scenario , and Event201 into the current day .\nFurther adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of witnesses will consist of an assortment of lung experts , professors , a pharmaceutical executive , and biologists ; who Fuellmich stated in part will : \u201c explain to us what is behind the legend of the Wuhan wet market outbreak .\nThey will show that the virus is no more dangerous than the common flu .\nThe PCR test can not tell us

of experts comprised of doctors from around the world including Switzerland , Texas , South Africa , England , and Germany .\nAll who will attest to the misguided policies of government bodies

will further proceed by calling numerous experts from the US , France , Belgium , and Germany ; including renowned psychology professor Dr. Mattias Desmet .\nWho will elucidate the facts upon how various authoritarian measures were introduced into society , and maintained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear campaign .\nFinally concluding with the last two groups of experts , various professors and economists from the United States and Germany to elaborate as to the controlled implosion of the world \u2019 s economy through the imposition of economically destructive measures .\nMoving towards a

, and that they can be withdrawn again at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In March of 2020 , in violation of the principles embedded in our constitutions , governments around the world convinced citizens to give their leaders and public institutions the authority to overrule individual rights in order to \u201c flatten the curve.\n\u201d That impulse went unchallenged under the false assumption that human rights violations could be justified as long as the benefits to the majority outweighed the costs to the minority .\nBy accepting this excuse for overriding unconditional rights , we transformed ourselves into an authoritarian police state where \u201c might makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when all the checks and balances in our scientific and democratic institutions stopped functioning .\nLiberal democracy was built around the principle that individual rights must be unconditional .\nIn other words , they are meant to supersede the authority of government .\nConsequently , individual rights ( such as bodily autonomy ) were meant to serve as checks and balances on government power .\nThey were meant to provide a hard limit to what our government can do to us without our individual consent .\nIf the government can not override your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then it will be forced to try to convince you by talking with you .\nThat forces government to be transparent and to engage in meaningful debate with critics .\nYour ability to say NO , and to have your choice respected , is the difference between a functioning liberal democracy and an authoritarian regime .\nThe natural instinct of fearful people is to control those around them .\nUnconditional rights force people to negotiate voluntary participation in collective solutions .\nThus , unconditional rights prevent the formation of echo chambers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncontrolled panic .\nWhen no-one has the option to use the brute force of State power to force others to submit to what they think is \u201c the right thing to do \u201d , then the only path forward is to keep talking to everyone , including to \u201c fringe minorities \u201d with \u201c unacceptable views \u201d .\nWhen we allow rights to become conditional ,

be used to cut off scientific debates .\nOur governments and our fellow citizens MUST be made to understand that unconditional rights are especially important during a crisis .\nIf the legal and ethical fallacies that were used to justify mandates are not called out as inexcusable violations of our constitutional rights , we will have inadvertently normalized the illiberal idea that , as long

"humansarefree", "title": "Freemasonry: The Secret Science of Symbolism", "content": "It was during its transitional phase of the early nineteenth century that Freemasonry began to change its public symbolism .\nDuring the eighteenth century , the skull and crossbones were used to mark the grave of a Freemason , the symbol being recognised by fellow Freemasons as the resting-place of a Master Mason .\nThough the skull and crossbones can be interpreted as a symbol of mortality , the use of the symbol on the figurative grave in the third degree \u2018 raising \u2019 ceremony symbolises immortality , with the Master Mason being symbolically resurrected .\nThe symbolism on Masonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1800 \u2019 s , and the traditional and somewhat terrifying skull and crossbones , was replaced by the much more \u2018 modern \u2019 square and compass .\nThis more scientific and modern symbol began appearing on many headstones marking the grave of Freemasons after the unification of the \u2018 Modern \u2019 and \u2018 Antient \u2019 Grand Lodges in 1813 , and was adopted as the official public symbol of the new United Grand Lodge .\nThe theme of immortality within Freemasonry is represented by a further array of symbolism .\nThe symbolism of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Knights Templar ritual alongside the skull and crossbones , is also used as a representation of life and resurrection .\nThe snake swallowing its own tail symbolises eternity within Freemasonry and can been seen as a stylised symbol of infinity .\nThe sprig of Acacia , which is used as a symbol in the third degree , also represents immortality.1 The Acacia tree supposedly grew on the grave of Hiram Abbif and could be seen as a continuation of the life cycle , his death giving life to the tree .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Tabernacle , both of which resided in Solomon \u2019 s Temple , were both , according to legend , made of Acacia wood , as was Christ \u2019 s crown of thorns , and also the cross on which he was crucified , which represents the Christian belief in the Resurrection.2 Christ \u2019 s resurrection is presented in the Knights Templar ritual , presenting a similar theme to the third degree of Craft Masonry , with the raising of Christ being entwined with the search for hidden knowledge.3 Pomegranates , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented re-birth and resurrection , and were used in the third degree \u2018 raising \u2019 ceremony , during the eighteenth century , being displayed around the figurative grave.4 The pentagram , representing the five wounds of Christ , and the five points of fellowship , which is the embrace used in the raising of the Mason , is a powerful and potent symbol , and also symbolises \u2018 resurrection \u2019 , especially with the representation of the resurrection of Christ after receiving the five wounds during crucifixion .\nThe use of the pyramid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen to represent \u2018 resurrection \u2019 , as the mummified Pharaoh \u2019 s were buried within the pyramid , only to \u2018 rise \u2019 again in another world .\nThe pyramid also symbolises another form of sacred Temple , constructed using sacred geometry .\nThe significance of the Mason completing three degrees is seen as a journey from birth , through maturity and then on to death , only to be reborn as an enlightened Master Mason , having discovered the secrets of the Craft .\nThis theme had been discussed by Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the millennium , the \u2018 children of the resurrection \u2019 would reside in the New Jerusalem , the spirits of just men being made perfect .\nNewton devoured works on alchemy , philosophy and the Old Testament , searching for ancient knowledge to understand biblical prophecies and mystical alchemy .\nHis research , which appeared wide and varied on anything remotely related to alchemy , also included Rosicrucian works such as the Fama and Confessio.5 The mysterious Rosicrucian Brotherhood during the seventeenth century were believed to be immortal and \u2018 invisible \u2019 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interest of early Freemasons like Ashmole and Moray .\nThe Rose symbolised immortality , and the rose placed on a cross , was meant to symbolise the secret of immortality.6 Later Rosicrucian societies also held the symbolism of immortality in its ritual .\nThe resurrection of the mysterious mythical founder of the order , Christian Rosencreutz , was re-enacted within the ritual , the symbolic figure rising from his tomb .\nThe Rosicrucian symbolism of immortality is also reflected in Arthurian myth , such as the expected \u2018 resurrection \u2019 of King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some legends had the ability to heal and give immortality .\nThe Holy Grail was also seen as a symbol for alchemy,7 a sacred life-giving vessel which had contained the blood of Christ , also becoming linked to the Rosicrucians .\nThe importance of this symbolism still resounds today with speculative writers such as Michael Baigent using the Holy Grail in connection with Freemasonry and other secret societies.8 The Rosicrucian order , like Freemasonry , focused on a holy building , called the House of the Holy Spirit , which immediately echoes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Masonic ritual .\nThe rediscovery of ancient knowledge was also featured , and the opening of the tomb of Christian Rosencreutz ( which itself was seen as a representation of the Universe ) reinforced the belief within the mysterious Rosicrucian Order of the second coming of Rosencreutz and led the way to the revealing of the secrets of the Universe itself .\nThe Kabbalistic and Hermetic themes of immortality and the discovery of the hidden secrets of Nature symbolised in Rosicrucianism is certainly reflected in Freemasonry , and the journey made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degrees .\nThe journey is also a spiritual and educational one , the Mason gaining ultimate wisdom and an understanding of the hidden secrets of Nature and Science .\nThe Charge given to the candidate during the third degree in Freemasonry refers to the search for knowledge which will lead to the ultimate discovery : Continue to listen to the voice of nature , which bears witness , that even in this perishable frame resides a vital and immortal principle , which inspires a holy confidence that the Lord of Life will enable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath our feet\u20269 The apparent paradox of the modern third degree \u2018 raising \u2019 ceremony is that the newly made Master Mason is first told of the emblems of mortality which lies before him , only to be told that he is reborn to a new awareness , an awareness of immortality .\nDeath and rebirth is a constant theme , and the ritual became popular , spreading quickly throughout Europe .\nIn the eighteenth century Masonic ritual expos\u00e9 \u2018 Three Distinct Knocks \u2019 , a description to the climax of the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eerily given : \u201c The French have a very solemn way of representing ( Hiram \u2019 s ) Death ; for when you come into the Lodge to be made a Master , there is a Brother laid down in the Place where you are to lie , with his Face all besmear \u2019 d with Blood ; and they say to you , Brother , don \u2019 t be frighten \u2019 d , for one of our Brothers is kill \u2019 d , because he would not deliver the Master \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had no Right to it ; and it is the Duty of us all so to do ; to die before we will deliver any Part of Masonry to them that have no Right to it .\nWhen you kneel down to receive the Obligation the supposed dead Man lies behind you ; and while you are reading the Obligation and History of his Death , he gets up unknown to you , and you are laid down in his Place\u2026 \u201d 10 The theatre of necromancy presented within the third degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death and rebirth of the Master Mason symbolising the endless search for lost ancient knowledge .\nThe skull and crossbones very likely represented necromancy themes within the medieval Knights Templar order .\nThe legend of the \u2018 Skull of Sidon \u2019 reveals the story of a Templar Knight who had a relationship with a woman .\nThe woman died , and as to consummate the relationship , the Templar Knight dug up the woman \u2019 s grave , and made love to her , which resulted in the birth of a son nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the form of a skull and crossbones which protected the Knight and endowed him with magical powers .\nAgain , the skull and crossbones seem to symbolise immortality , with the continuation of life after death , entwined with secret wisdom .\nIn the third degree , the Mason , as he lies in the figurative grave , also has his right leg crossed over his left , which is also similar to effigies of the buried Templar Knights .\nAnother legend , which portrays the theme of immortality , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King , Robert the Bruce .\nWhen his grave was opened , the remains of Bruce was said to have been found with his leg bones crossed beneath his skull .\nBruce has been linked to the Templar order by a number of speculative writers , who suggest , despite the lack of evidence , the order survived in Scotland , eventually influencing modern Freemasonry.11 The necromancy traditions within the Templar movement are also reminiscent of the tale of the raising of Noah by his three sons who are searching for his secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge from the dead was a popular theme during the seventeenth century , with biblical references to the raising of the dead being well known.12 With notorious necromancers such as John Dee practising their art so openly , the search for the lost knowledge of the ancients became an exploration into the realms of the dark arts .\nThe popular image of the skull being used as an occultist tool may also have originated as part of the process of alchemy .\nDuring the process , a phase called the Dead Head occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just before the discovery of the philosopher \u2019 s stone , which produced the elusive Elixir of life .\nThe imagery that is constantly portrayed is one of the spiritual student attaining liberation and sacred knowledge , and it is only after the symbolic death of his old self that the new enlightened master craftsman can enter a new level of existence .\nThe skull is also symbolic of the Sign of Sympathy , which consisted of the striking of the skull three times .\nThis also takes place during the \u2018 raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mystical Masonic number seven , as there are supposedly seven openings to the skull .\nStevenson in his Origins of Freemasonry discusses the skull as an early Masonic symbol in Scotland representing death and rebirth , the skull , compass and square featuring on a list of symbols included in a poem displayed at the end of the early eighteenth century Dumfries No.4 Manuscript.13 Another Masonic symbol , which sometimes appeared on gravestones during the eighteenth century , was the hourglass , which , though represented mortality , was in certain cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hourglass , however , was also linked to alchemy , and appeared in many contemporary prints and works of art which covered the theme of alchemy and Rosicrucianism .\nThe hourglass , though reminding man of his time on Earth , could be turned over , letting the sand run again , and therefore giving an endless , limitless existence .\nThe shape of the hourglass is also reminiscent of the infinity symbol ( \u221e ) and is displayed alongside other related symbols such as the scythe , Noah \u2019 s Ark and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the eighteenth century .\nThe Greek philosophers believed that time could be defeated , and the Metaphysical poets of the seventeenth century , such as Donne , expressed the same ethos in their poetry .\nYet , as a Masonic symbol on gravestones , the hourglass became disused , and like the skull and crossbones , was replaced by the square and compass after the unification in 1813 .\nPublic perception of these symbols would have differed greatly from the small percentage of the population that were Freemasons .\nA fellow Freemason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public opinion may have been confused , leading to misconceptions regarding the image .\nThe skull and crossbones signified danger and conjured up fear and is highly reminiscent of the \u2018 jolly roger \u2019 , the pirate flag which began to be used in the early seventeenth century .\nThe skull and crossbones displayed on flags were also used by some Masonic lodges , such as the old South Saxon Lodge which was erected from Lewes Castle when the lodge met there during the early nineteenth century.14 Another symbol used on the flags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , as we have just seen , was also used in Freemasonry .\nPerhaps the change of symbolism may have been an attempt to move away from the older , magical , mysterious , terrifying imagery ; the new United Grand Lodge adopting a more modern and scientific symbol for the gravestones as a recognition of the new science and God \u2019 s reason , though it was a symbol which still represented the same meaning , that of life , death and re-birth .\nAlchemists and the Search for the Elixir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew upon the Rosicrucian links to alchemy and the search for the Philosophers Stone .\nThe Philosophers Stone was identified with the Elixir , the mythical substance which would bestow eternal life , and could be gained after years of study and learning .\nThis was still seen during the seventeenth century as a form of old science , Sir Isaac Newton actually practising alchemy and interpreting biblical prophecy , alongside his other , more \u2018 modernist \u2019 experimental work .\nBiblical characters such as Moses , who were noted in the Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were seen as early alchemists , and Newton became obsessed with the search for hidden codes in Greco-Roman mythology and in the biblical texts .\nNewton believed that these ancient stories hid the codes which could reveal the secret of alchemy , the ancient mythological and biblical characters literally transmuting their hidden knowledge to the modern philosophers through their encoded texts .\nNewton saw himself as the chosen One , chosen by God himself to decipher the mysteries of Nature and biblical prophecy , unlocking the secrets of God \u2019 s Universe using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experimental natural philosophy.15 One strange and mysterious figure who was said to have discovered the secret of immortality was Nicolas Flamel .\nFlamel was a fourteenth century scribe who was based in Paris , and supposedly discovered an ancient Kabbalistic manuscript .\nThis supposedly enabled Flamel to turn base metal into gold and gave him eternal life .\nFlamel \u2019 s work in alchemy created many legends , and supposed sightings of him were recorded well into the eighteenth century.16 A legendary mysterious figure who was linked to Freemasonry and the Rosicrucians in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Germain , like Flamel before him , was said to have experimented with alchemy and the occult , and became well known throughout the courts of Europe .\nHe was said to have been a Freemason himself and had known the Freemasons Casanova and Voltaire , the later referring to St. Germain as the \u201c man who never dies and knows everything.\n\u201d 18 Certainly historical alchemists such as Johann Baptista Van Helmont ( 1577\u20131644 ) , contributed to early chemistry , and inspired Newton \u2019 s research into this field , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have transmuted mercury into gold by using the Philosophers Stone.19 The search for hidden knowledge was part of the alchemists work , and the popular imagery surrounding this esoteric research resounds in the necromantic themes of the \u2018 Modern \u2019 Masonic third degree ritual , a ritual revised by Desaguliers , a disciple of Newton who was fully aware of the power of alchemy .\nAnother mysterious , though historical figure who was linked to necromancy , alchemy and the occult , was Johannes Faust .\nLittle is known of Faust , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BA in divinity at Heidelberg in 1509 , and like Flamel and St. Germain , gained mythical status as a man who sought hidden knowledge in an attempt to gain eternal life .\nFaust was also the inspiration for Christopher Marlow \u2019 s play \u2018 Doctor Faustus \u2019 and the Freemason Goethe \u2019 s \u2018 Faust \u2019 , both telling of how Faust sold his soul to the devil , paying the ultimate price for his search for forbidden knowledge .\nMarlow \u2019 s play , published not long before Bacon \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scene with vivid necromantic Masonic-like imagery describing a mixture of early natural philosophy , magical symbolism and ritualistic practices : These metaphysics of magicians and necromantic books are heavenly ; lines , circles , letters , characters \u2013 ay , these are those that Faustus most desires.20 Marlow describes a ritual which is reminiscent of third degree Masonry , a ritual which certainly has parallels with John Dee and Edward Kelley \u2019 s ritual practices , having Faustus searching for hidden knowledge to raise the dead , using magical symbols in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elizabethan mystic and alchemist who became deeply involved in necromancy , his accomplice Edward Kelley , supposedly having attempted to \u2018 resurrect \u2019 a corpse in a graveyard in Walton-le-Dale in Lancashire .\nKelley allegedly exhumed the corpse and apparently forced it to speak using magic so it could reveal the whereabouts of a hidden fortune.21 The mysterious ritual that Kelley performed on the corpse also reflects the third degree in Freemasonry , the use of necromantic imagery and the theme of immortality entwined with the search for lost knowledge .\nThe third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Master Mason that \u2018 he may finally arise from the tomb of transgression \u2019 , the search for lost knowledge culminating in a performance of necromancy .\nThough all of these figures are enveloped in myth , they may have inspired many Rosicrucian visionaries and early Freemasons , such as Ashmole and Moray , into researching the hidden mysteries of nature and science .\nCertainly Elias Ashmole became fascinated by the work of Dee and his accomplice Kelley , referring to them in his \u2018 Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum \u2019 , stating how they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Elixir in the ruins of Glastonbury Abbey ( a traditional resting place for King Arthur ) .\nThe themes of resurrection within Freemasonry , and the symbolism attached to Masonic gravestones , certainly seem to represent a belief in the eternal cycle of life , and the educational processes , which led the Mason to discover spiritual purity and immortality of the soul .\nThis is perhaps a more symbolic natural approach to everlasting life , and the influence of mysterious figures such as St. Germain , Flamel , Faust and Dee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom were supposedly learned in ancient knowledge , all having completed an educational journey of discovery in connection with alchemy and magic .\nThe above is abridged and excerpted with permission from Dr. David Harrison \u2019

Impossible", "content": "Of all the social drivers in history the concept of freedom is the most powerful and fascinating .\nThere are many observable objective truths in the world and it \u2019 s always important to recognize them , but the idea of freedom is more rare because it is a universal SUBJECTIVE truth .\nMeaning , it exists inherently in the majority of individuals ; we don \u2019 t learn it , we just know it instinctively .\nMost of us share the experience but there is no microscope or telescope in existence that can observe that experience .\nWe just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have faith .\nFreedom is not taught to us , we are born with the idea already hardwired .\nIf anything , it has to be conditioned out of us .\nWe can see the aftereffects of the human experience of freedom in the great upheavals that occur when our societies become too rigid , too controlled and too authoritarian .\nSome will argue that tyrants have no concept of freedom and this debunks the notion that it \u2019 s an inherent psychological quality , but this is a misconception .\nMany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves .\nLike an obsessive compulsive , when the average authoritarian sees free movement within the rest of society all he sees is chaos that needs to be micro-managed .\nHe is so mentally unhinged by the existence of independent activity that he is compelled to crush it and impose his brand of \u201c order.\n\u201d If you want to understand the thinking process of the political left today , this is where you need to start .\nThey believe only certain special people deserve to have freedom ( or deserve to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of that group .\nThe rest of us can \u2019 t be trusted with freedom because we \u201c think the wrong way , \u201d and so we need to be corralled and fenced in .\nThis is not to say that some structure within society is wrong , it can be a good thing , but not when it is imposed by an elitist minority of psychopathic people .\nThere will never be any justice within such a system , no fairness and no true progress .\nAuthoritarianism is the opposite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet these people call themselves \u201c progressives.\n\u201d Freedom requires boldness and courage because it demands personal responsibility .\nWhen you are free to make your own decisions you are also free to fail , and only you can be blamed for your own failures .\nThis is a terrifying notion for most leftists and collectivists because they believe that they are owed a positive outcome regardless of their actions or merit .\nThey believe it is their \u201c right \u201d to be taken care of by others if they are incapable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is not equality , this is \u201c equity.\n\u201d This is stealing wealth and opportunity from more worthy people in order to artificially inflate others that put in little or no effort .\nMeritocracy is the most equal system in existence because it is freedom based ; equality of opportunity is the epitome of fairness ; equity of outcome is the epitome of injustice .\nLeftists hyperfocus on race , skin color and sexual identity for this very reason .\nThey are desperately searching for a way to circumvent the obstacles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything in society can be reduced down to race , then personal accomplishment and responsibility are no longer relevant .\nIn the mind of the leftist , if certain people are inherently oppressed and others are inherently oppressive , then equality of opportunity is not enough and equity of outcome must be enforced .\nMaking everything about victim group status thereby erases freedom and meritocracy can not function .\nAll a person needs to do is say \u201c I am oppressed , therefore I am entitled , \u201d and if they meet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a livelihood or success simply because they exist .\nI saw a commercial on YouTube a week ago for yet another social justice documentary titled \u2018 Everything \u2019 s Going To Be All White , \u2019 once again attempting to pontificate on our supposed reign of dominance across every facet of the globe and I could not help but think this entire narrative is nothing more than a cowardly attempt to deflect responsibility .\nYes , it \u2019 s also an attempt to divide and conquer western nations but how many people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV shows un-ironically ?\nAccording to the stats and reviews there aren \u2019 t very many .\nNearly every claim made in these productions is based on previously debunked social justice misrepresentations of history from books like \u2018 White Fragility \u2019 and movements like the 1619 Project .\nIf you really want to get an accurate representation of US history in particular and the limited role slavery played in terms of modern social outcomes , then I suggest reading the works of Thomas Sowell , a brilliant black American economist and historian with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a mere footnote in our past , not an all encompassing determinant of our present and future as leftists like to argue .\nThere is no legal slavery in America , and there is no one alive today in America who has experience race based slavery or that has been affected by it .\nSlavery and racism were far more pervasive in nations of brown and black people in history .\nIn fact , some of these countries still engage in various forms of slavery today .\nIf you want to experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person then travel to a country like China and see how long it takes before you are kicked out of an establishment for your skin color .\nWhite people are not the problem , people who disrespect the benefits of freedom are the problem regardless of their skin .\nWhat we need to understand is that race and oppression propaganda is not really rooted in race and oppression .\nIt appeals to a certain subset of our population because it offers them a way to rationalize their lack of merit and their fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can blame white people for all your problems and have this be believed , then the temptation to fail is increased because there are no consequences .\nWhy work hard to make something of yourself if you can do nothing and be rewarded anyway ?\nBy extension , the racism blame game is alluring to many in society because it can be used as a weapon to harm political enemies .\nWhen leftists complain about the evils of \u201c white people \u201d what they are really talking about are the \u201c evils \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conform to the leftist ideology .\nThey rarely come right out and say it , but one day the documentaries will switch from \u201c Dear White People \u201d to \u201c Dear Conservatives.\n\u201d The fight has never been about race , it \u2019 s always been about ideals and principles and eliminating the ideals that contradict the leftist mission .\nThis is why they are consistently hostile to anyone conservative , even more so if that person is black .\nThe leftist agenda is all about diminishing freedom and societal respect for freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about management , everything is about centralization , everything is about control .\nConservatives and many moderates stand in direct opposition to this .\nThe most common mistake among newbies in the liberty movement is when they try to explain away leftist actions by bringing up the \u201c false left/right paradigm.\n\u201d These people don \u2019 t understand what this actually means .\nThe left/right paradigm exists at the TOP of the social and political pyramid ; top political and corporate leaders pretend to be in one party or the other while in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implementing the same policies .\nAt the bottom of the pyramid among regular people there is no false left/right paradigm \u2013 There is a very real left/right division .\nThis is undeniable now in the face of the covid and jjab mandates .\nFor the longest time I have heard people claim that when the push for authoritarianism in the US arrived many conservatives would simple go along with it .\nYet , today numerous conservative red states are fighting the mandates tooth and nail while leftist blue states have been suffocated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have acted as beacons of rebellion for the world \u2013 Without them it is unlikely that the Supreme Court would have dropped Biden \u2019 s federal vax mandates .\nThe threat of war is tangible if such mandates are ever instituted , and the Supreme Court knows this .\nI have had people ask me in the past why there haven \u2019 t been any major actions on the part of conservatives in the US against the mandates and I have to break it to them that there ARE NO MANDATES in conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for at least 18 months .\nNone .\nZero .\nZip .\nWe don \u2019 t need to protest because we stopped the mandates before they could take hold .\nAs I have said from the very beginning of the pandemic response , if even a handful of states or countries can remain free from covid controls they will inspire people around the world and act as proof that the mandates are pointless .\nToday , as America continues to beat back the covid agenda there are mass protests in Canada and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrictions .\nFreedom spreads like wildfire once the flames are sparked .\nLeftists hate this .\nCovid , like the fantasy of \u201c institutional racism , \u201d is a tempting vehicle to forward their ideology .\nIf you can convince the public that they are a constant threat to themselves and each other , then it is a small matter to convince them that government needs to step in and protect society from itself and from notions of freedom that might put society at risk .\nWithout covid as a foil the political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to perpetuate the lie that the virus is an imminent threat to the majority of people when the average Infection Fatality Rate is a tiny 0.27 % .\nThe real question here is , when a group of people hate freedom this much how is it possible to coexist with them ?\nThe answer is we can \u2019 t .\nAnyone who defends merit and liberty will always be a target of those that despise merit and liberty .\nThey will never stop .\nThey will forever be looking for ways to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race based propaganda don \u2019 t work then they will search for another tool to do the job .\nIf one can say anything \u201c good \u201d about leftists , it \u2019 s that they do not give up even when they are clearly outmatched and beaten .\nThe problem is that this dedication to their cause is not based in love or truth , but in zealotry and cultism .\nThey are jihadists , and nothing , not logic , not facts , not reason nor moral principle will convince them of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is the solution ?\nOne could suggest that we make it easy for them to leave .\nAfter all , if they hate America as much as they say they do then why are they still living here ?\nProbably because most other places in the world are abysmal in comparison .\nBut if we keep them around they will drag the country down to the same terrible level .\nIt \u2019 s a conundrum .\nBeyond that , what country would want them ?\nSocial justice is seen as a cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leftist migrants would be a disaster for them economically and socially , even in nations that claim to support leftist models .\nMost leftists would also refuse to leave anyway because they believe they should decide the path of America \u2019 s future .\nAs much as they hate this country they see themselves as its saviors .\nThen there is the option of internal separation , which I see as preferable .\nThis is already happening in many forms as conservatives and moderates from blue states relocate by the millions to red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montana there has been an influx of migrants from blue states and every single new person I have talked to is a conservative/prepper whose family lived in a blue state for generations and they finally got fed up .\nThe vast majority of people moving are conservative minded and they are now congregating .\nWhy not carry this process forward to its natural conclusion ?\nRed states break from blue states and red counties break from blue state control and we live our lives the way we see fit .\nLet the leftists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models and see how well that goes for them .\nI guarantee they will be in financial ruins within a decade ( the list of most indebted places in the country is dominated by blue states ) and they will be begging to return to a union with red states ( except for the zealots , which would lose influence as they continue to fail ) .\nBut this will not happen peacefully because , again , leftists can not tolerate free activity .\nTheir OCD will not allow them to be content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own ; ALL states must be collectivist before they are satisfied .\nPeople are property to them ; property of the collective , and people who are property can not be allowed to make decisions without oversight .\nThere are people who will naively argue that the establishment wants America divided and separation plays into their hands .\nGuess what ?\nThere is no reconciliation with tyrants and trying to maintain a union with them is the pinnacle of idiocy .\nThere is no union , it is a figment of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we stay within the box ; that we continue wasting all our time and attention on on trying to hold a system together that is corrupt beyond repair .\nWe will never be allowed to peacefully repair what has been broken .\nUnfortunately , the only path this leaves is one of violence [ personally , I don \u2019 t condone violence ] .\nLeftists will have to be forced out of positions of power and influence and removed from our culture like a cancerous tumor is cut from the body to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t think this should be the obvious choice .\nI don \u2019 t want it to be .\nWhat I am saying is , leftists and their partners in government and the corporate world will force the issue because they can not help it ; like the story of the scorpion and the frog , it \u2019 s in their nature to destroy .\nThey will continue to push and steal and threaten and abuse until they get the inevitable response of a punch in the teeth .\nThen , they will play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This crying and gaslighting will have to be ignored .\nIn the end , these people can not be tolerated in a free culture and their power to harm and enslave others must be removed , one way or another .", "author": "HAF", "url": "https://humansbefree.com/2022/02/why-sharing-a-society-with-the-political-left-is-impossible.html", "published": "Sat, 12 Feb 2022 11:00:20 +0000",

which \u201c argues that the laws , rules and , regulations that govern society today have been shaped by the historical subordination of people of colour and that this is a driving force behind racial inequality today , \u201d according to Breitbart .\nAs an example of the supposed racism embedded in every fiber of America \u2019 s institutions , the WEF points to the high number of

anti-freedom , liberty-destroying , and deadly response ever undertaken here in this country and globally .\nWe will never know exactly how many have and will die due to this evil draconian response to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag event meant to achieve a totalitarian outcome .\nMany have said that the response was worse than the threat , but this is a smoke and mirrors and hypocritical reaction , because there was never any legitimate threat in the first place , other than the democidal tendencies of the state against the people .\nThis is literally a war against the common man , and an eager willingness by those in power to destroy or genocide certain individuals , groups , ethnicities , select members of certain demographic makeups , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class , the psychologically weak , and the most vulnerable among us ; simply to gain total power and control of all monetary , financial , economic , geopolitical , and societal systems worldwide .\nWith this end in sight , the next obvious step is to gain complete control of all children by bio-weapon injections meant to subdue the minds and bodies of future generations .\nThis plot is already underway\u2026 Also read : World

demanded and implemented , one can only come to the certain conclusion that the death of many in this population due to the response to a fake \u2018 virus , \u2019 has not only been planned and sought by the powerful and their pawns , but has been intentionally put into place over the past two years .\nThis is a long-planned scheme meant to achieve a particular outcome of death and control .\nTo argue this is to ignore reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on fallacy .\nConsider Remdesivir , a killer drug promoted knowingly by the evil Fauci .\nIt became basically the only hospital treatment for the fraud called \u2018 Covid-19 \u2019 early on in this scam .\nIt was well known to be extremely toxic and deadly .\nIt was approved for emergency use by the FDA on May 1 , 2020 , and was subsequently fully approved by the FDA to treat \u2018 Covid-19 \u2019 on October 22 , 2020 .\nJust recently on January 22 , 2022 , the FDA granted expedited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Remdesivir , based on the recommendation of Fauci and the NIH .\nNine of the people at NIH who recommended this poison , had financial ties to the maker of Veklury ( Remdesivir ) , Gilead Sciences .\nConsider the mass use of ventilators , especially in New York .\nMost so-called \u2018 Covid \u2019 patients put on these machines for \u2018 Covid \u2019 treatment died .\nAccording to a study done early on by the American Medical Association Network : \u201c Mortality rates for those who received mechanical ventilation in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % and 97.2 % , respectively .\nMortality rates for those in the 18-to-65 and older-than-65 age groups who did not receive mechanical ventilation were 19.8 % and 26.6 % , respectively.\n\u201d Consider that stress is a known major killer , and extreme stress brought on by the bogus response to a non-existent \u2018 virus , \u2019 caused many deaths ; not only in the U.S. , but all around the world .\nThis was due to lockdowns , quarantine , loss of family and friend contact , suicide , isolation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bankruptcy , business closures , travel restrictions , and much more tyranny aimed at the general population .\nConsider the restriction of treatments for all sickness due to the fact that most every ill and every symptom was co-opted and said to be \u2018 Covid.\n\u201d Hospitals refused to treat patients , medical facilities closed their doors , certain drugs and natural treatments were outlawed , necessary surgeries were cancelled , and eventually , many , if not most , medical services were eliminated for those who refused to take an experimental bio-weapon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisons or nursing homes without any sympathy or loosening of restrictions by the evil state .\nThe government and its bosses were and are willing to commit murder , and their enforcement goons and political allies are willing to assist in this murder of innocents , all in the name of state control and tyranny , but there has been a change of heart recently by larger numbers of people , much due to those willing to fight back to regain some freedom .\nThis is happening worldwide by not only truckers but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own destiny , and if we all as individuals say no and support those willing to put themselves in harm \u2019 s way for the benefit of all , we can defeat this enemy called the state , and stop the madness that has consumed this planet .\nIt is up to each individual to fight for his own liberty ; it will not be secured for you ; you must act on your own behalf .", "author": "HAF", "url":

is Turning Into the Great Awakening", "content": "There are few words to describe the depth of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau \u2019 s depravity .\nI \u2019 m not going to even try .\nThis is a person ( because no real man would ever govern like him ) is so thoroughly ill-prepared for its job it doesn \u2019 t even know how to properly read from the prepared script .\nIt was all fun and games making Trudeau/Hitler memes until yesterday when Trudeau \u2019 s enforcers on horseback trampled an old woman : A man with any sense of decency does not send men on horseback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse than that are the people commenting on this saying some variation of \u2018 well , she deserved it.\n\u2019 Yes , she could have gone home .\nYes , she could have gotten the clot-shot .\nYes , she could have just complied with whatever Justin Trudeau told her what her morality was .\nBut Trudeau could have chosen differently as well .\nAs opposed to acting like a scared little boy worried about facing public ridicule , he could have sacked up and met with the protestors .\nInstead , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he chose violence and intimidation .\nThose who blame the victims are worse than Justin Trudeau .\nThey will never admit it , even to themselves , but their belief in the state as moral arbiter is shaken to its foundation when things like this happen .\nSo they bluster about playing stupid games , win stupid prizes .\nEmpathy ?\nWho needs that in Davos \u2019 Brave New World .\nThose against the protests have their reasons , none of them , however , are morally justified .\nBecause if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at its core , to define your morality , you will forever having to justify tyranny to remain on the side of the angels .\nBlaming the victim is the easiest thing to do .\nHow many rapists have claimed \u201c she had it coming ?\n\u201d How many abusers every day blame the people they abuse because they are too ashamed to admit they are in the wrong ?\nWe Are All Unclean Now The part of the Great Reset pertaining to COVID-19 was always about amplifying the divisions between people .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIts sacrament is the jjab .\nIts Lord \u2019 s prayer is demonizing ivermectin and trusting the science .\nIts vestment is the mask .\nIts \u201c amen , \u201d is \u201c in the name of public health.\n\u201d It has led to such dehumanizing that those who do not comply with the high priests now deserve their fate .\nMario Draghi in Italy declared the unvaccinated to no longer be a part of Italian society : And , in a way , sadly , Trudeau \u2019 s supporters are correct .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abuse if the alternative is death .\nThat woman didn \u2019 t go to Parliament Square with that choice in mind because , she , sadly , still believed in the religion of the State as a subordinate partner with the people in shaping society .\nThose final illusions were trampled fully in the eyes of millions around the world .\nPolitically , there is no going back for Justin Trudeau .\nHe , along with his supporters , will hide behind their \u2018 cope \u2019 and refuse to accept the responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are doing the same thing , putting out disinformation about trying to trip the horses and harm the policemen .\nAt this point those still on the job in Ottawa made a choice as well , to side with tyrants and embrace their own inner one .\nMany of them will enjoy finally getting to mete out the violence that festers in their souls , after all , it \u2019 s why many of them became cops in the first place .\nThose who still have their humanity are now deciding whether to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they go along they will lose what \u2019 s left of their humanity just like men did during World War II .\nAnd their true face has been revealed .\nNo Zeal for More Tyranny Now , as bad as things are in Canada , In New Zealand , Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern , tried to follow Trudeau \u2019 s script to quell protests in Wellington .\nAnd from all reports there , her efforts have failed completely .\nShe convened a meeting of essentially the national security council on Thursday .\nWe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down .\nTherefore , the silence about the outcome of that meeting speaks volumes .\nThe military weren \u2019 t willing to get involved , just like what happened to Trudeau in Canada .\nMoreover , New Zealand \u2019 s police commissioner Andrew Coster came out with a public statement saying negotiation was the path forward , something Arden has rejected out of hand , just like Trudeau , both reading from the same Davos \u2019 script .\n\u201c Coster said negotiations and de-escalation were the only safe ways to resolve the protest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the protesters .\nPolice say there are about 800 protesters but numbers could rise over the weekend .\nCoster said any forceful police action would risk injuries to the public and could turn a largely peaceful protest violent , and could increase the number of protesters.\n\u201d Ottawa Police Chief Peter Sloly tried to hold the line against Trudeau \u2019 s megalomania earlier this week .\nThat resulted in him resigning , presumably because he wouldn \u2019 t give the order to roust up the protestors and beat heads , and a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The result is what we \u2019 re witnessing now in Ottawa : The casual obscenity in this clip is the newscasters \u2019 commentary about police restoring order .\nThe reality is that Ardern and Trudeau are both hanging on by a thread because public opinion already turned against them .\nThe only thing propping Trudeau up at this point is the shock at the speed he has escalated events .\nThat shock will wear off very soon .\nIf parliament doesn \u2019 t act to limit/censure or simply get rid of this guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem on their hands .\nToo many Canadians are still asking , \u201c Is this Canada ?\n\u201d When they should be stating , \u201c This is not Canada.\n\u201d Stop asking for permission to feel outraged and feel the outrage .\nIn New Zealand , the veil of authority for Arden is thinner thanks to Trudeau \u2019 s mistakes in Ottawa .\nNo doubt they are seeing the same things we are and want no part of it .\nThe knives will come out for Ardern quickly if she doesn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , spooks start civil wars , militaries end them .\nIn Canada , the civil war there is just beginning .\nWhat we \u2019 ve not seen in New Zealand means it \u2019 s likely over before anyone even realized they were in one .\nThe Great Reset rests on tyrants like Justin Trudeau to win through fear , intimidation and the banal corruption of weak people to support them .\nWith each image of peaceful people being trampled under the bootheel of Canadian stormtroopers , more people awaken from the slumber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us from chaos .\nThat \u2019 s what the State is folks , violence .\nAlways has been .\nThis is why Klaus Schwab and his minions like Trudeau , Ardern and others will fail [ You can see Schwab \u2019 s list of \u201c Young Global Leaders \u201d HERE ] .\nThere is no law these people recognize .\nThere is no restraint on their behavior they feel is justified for their holy cause .\nThe sooner we accept that , like many of the truckers who organized this protest , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divide .\nI \u2019 ll leave the last word for Viva Frei :", "author": "HAF", "url":

Promoted Shamelessly in the Mainstream (and the Reality of Manifestation)", "content": "This morning I shared an article discussing the latest drama/outrage regarding a mainstream musician promoting Satanic imagery .\nEvery time I post/write about these types of issues \u2013 specifically , celebrities or musicians promoting this type of symbolism \u2013 there are two inevitable reactions : 1 .\nKnee jerk responses which reject the idea that this imagery could be anything more than art , or , at worst , an attempt to be edgy and troll conservatives into expressing outrage .\nThis mentality also assumes the images are aimed at increasing attention and thus album sales , attention , etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious types , and informed researchers who understand that the Predator Class is involved in various occult rituals and traditions which are not what they promote publicly .\nThese folks understand that there is an agenda to promote and normalize these traditions which invoke the left-hand path , aka do what thou will as long as it suits you .\nObviously , I am generalizing a bit here because this is a very nuanced and complex topic that deserves much attention .\nTherein lies the problem \u2013 this topic is not suited for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this issue one most study the Mystery Religions , the Secret Societies that are obsessed with them , and the connections to those in positions of power .\nI understand that it \u2019 s easy to dismiss the reactions to these situations as \u201c scared Christians \u201d or \u201c uptight square conservatives \u201d .\nIn fact , I empathize with this viewpoint because I often notice these groups afraid of things they don \u2019 t understand , including indigenous traditions that predate Christianity and the Abrahamic religions .\nI clash with these groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them .\nHowever , to dismiss this imagery , the purpose behind it , the history of these various occult teachings and the intention behind these \u201c dark religions \u201d \u2013 is the height of ignorance .\nMuch like the attempts to dismiss the reality of child trafficking involving high level government officials , the dismissal of the \u201c Satanic \u201d agenda is equally ignorant .\nWith all that said , I believe it is important to acknowledge that there are a great number of musicians , celebrities , influencers , etc who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these occult traditions .\nFor those who are unaware it might appear to be art or just a quirky artist seeking to create controversy .\nYet , for those educated in this area this agenda is very real and increasingly obvious in the mainstream world .\nYou don \u2019 t need to believe in the Christian God or the Devil or Satan or Lucifer to understand that the people practicing these traditions DO in fact believe in them .\nAnd that \u2019 s what really matters .\nThe truth is that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind .\nThey understand we each have the power to manifest our reality with our minds , our intentions , our words , symbols , and actions .\nIf one ignores this reality he/she will not actively make use of this power of manifestation .\nHowever , those who tap into this reality have the ability to manifest and shape the world around us .\nNow imagine that one has access to television , radio , the internet , and the attention of the masses because of your position ( politician , celebrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Mainstream media and various pieces of the Pyramid of Power , one could manipulate the masses into co-creating reality without being aware of the role they play .\nThis unconscious manifestation is one of the most dangerous powers of the Predator Class that rules the Pyramid of Power .\nThis also emphasizes the importance of individual mindfulness and empowerment .\nWe must liberate our hearts and minds from the world of propaganda surrounding ourselves so that we can shape and manifest our own destinies .\nRemember this fact the next time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and imagery .\nAlso , we should be open to possibility that many of these artists are victims themselves .\nIt is highly likely that these celebrities are not in complete control of the movies , videos , and images they are involved with .\nThey are likely being handled by someone else or a group of people who are much more aware of the agenda they are promoting .\nUltimately , this struggle \u2013 this Conscious Resistance \u2013 is a spiritual battle .\nAgain , one need not be a Christian to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize that the Predator Class is waging a war on our souls and our very being .\nIf we remain in control of our own minds and do the difficult work to heal our interpersonal traumas , we can ensure we are the one \u2019 s in control of our destiny .", "author": "HAF", "url":

his wealth via the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation ( BMGF ) .\nBut , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWho is the Director of the Wellcome Trust ?\nOne named Jeremy Farrar , of the United Kingdom SAGE and lockdown fame \u2013 arguably the architect of the US-UK lockdowns in 2020 \u2013 is closely associated with WEF .\nConcerning the reach that can occur , let me give some examples from the BMGF alone , and it comes from the time that I spent in 2020 reading their extensive funding list .\nA few years ago , the BMGF awarded the Institute for Health Metric Evaluation ( IHME ) a ten-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IHME ( associated with the University of Washington in Seattle ) was at the forefront of the computer modeling that was driving the lockdowns and the nonpharmaceutical Interventions during 2020 .\nPeople have seen their name often in print or on MSNBC or CNN .\nIn 2019 , IHME awarded the Editor of the Lancet ( Dr. Richard Horton ) a $ 100,000 award and described him as an \u201c activist editor.\n\u201d The Lancet , once considered one of the best medical journals , has been at the forefront of censoring opposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers \u201d that were not fit to be published .\nI never could understand what it meant to be an \u201c activist \u201d editor in a respected scientific/medical journal because , stupid me , I always thought that the first job of the editor was to be impartial .\nI guess I learned in 2020 how wrong I was .\nOf course , the Lancet is also heavily funded from pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer ( also a member of the WEF ) .\nBut , the BMGF reach goes far beyond just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognizable .\nHere are some examples of the organizations and moneys received during 2020 alone broken down by areas .\nBilly Boy has also invested heavily in Moderna and his investments have paid out nicely for him .\nThe BMGF has also given close to $ 100 million to the Clinton Health Access Initiative .\nThe questions now have to be asked : \u2022 Is this some beginning of a controlled authoritarian society intertwined via the WEF ?\n\u2022 Has the Covid panic been staged to set the stage ?\nPlease note , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d since the virus is real .\nBut , has a normal seasonal respiratory virus been used as an excuse to activate the web ?\nThe next questions , for those of us who at least pretend to live in \u201c Democratic \u201d societies , have to be : \u2022 Is this what you expected and/or want from the people you elect ?\n\u2022 How many people knew of the \u201c Associations \u201d of the people that they voted for ?\n( I certainly did not know of the associations until I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of touch ) Can we anticipate their next moves ?\nThere may be some hints .\nJeremy Farrar of The Wellcome Trust recently wrote an article for the WEF with the CEO of Novo Nordisk Foundation , Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen .\nIt is a summary of a larger piece written for and published by the Boston Consulting Group .\nIn this article , they propose that the way to \u201c fix \u201d the problem of antibiotic resistant bacteria is via a subscription service .\nThat is , you pay a fee and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an effective one will be available for you .\nMy guess is that they have the same philosophy for jjabs and that certainly seems to be the approach with Coronavirus .\nKeep paying for and taking boosters .\nIn view of this philosophy , the jjab mandates make sense .\nGet society \u201c addicted \u201d to an intervention , effective or not , and then keep feeding them .\nThis becomes especially effective if you can keep the fear going .\nThis approach is so shortsighted , from a scientific viewpoint , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of recent history , I think science has little to do with it .\nThe goal is not scientifically founded but control founded .\nAfter the discovery of penicillin almost one century ago , there were scientists who warned that antibiotic usage should be considered very carefully in practice because evolutionary pressures would lead to antibiotic resistant species of bacteria .\nAt that time , they were considered to be rogue scientists ; after all , didn \u2019 t we suddenly have a miracle cure for many deadly problems ?\nFrom the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decade before fermentation methods were developed to produce sufficient quantities of antibiotics to be practical .\nThese methods allowed for the use of penicillin on the battlefield towards the end of WWII and undoubtedly saved many lives then and later in subsequent wars ( Korea and Vietnam ) by preventing serious infections resulting from wounds sustained during battle .\nHowever , it did not take long before the medical establishment was handing out antibiotics like candy .\nI experienced this myself when I was a child in the 1960s .\nIt seemed like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no matter what the problem , I was given a series ( not just one ) of injections of penicillin .\nThere were never any attempts to determine if I had a virus , bacteria , or even an allergy .\nThe answer was : in with the needle .\nI can not count how many times I was \u201c jabbed \u201d as a child .\nIt didn \u2019 t take long before resistance species started to appear .\nThe result was that more and more money was pumped into R & @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in graduate school during the 1980s , one sure way to get some NIH funding was to tie the research into the \u201c antibiotic \u201d search .\nAntibiotics became big business .\nWe now have several classes of antibiotics that are used for specific cases .\nWe have Aminoglycosides ( Streptomycin , Neomycin , etc . )\n, Beta-Lactams Cephalosporins ( four generations including Cefadroxil-G1 , Cefaclor-G2 , Cefotaxime-G3 , Cefepime-G4 , Beta-Lactams Penicillins ( including Ampicillin , Amoxicillin , and Penicillin ) , Other Beta-Lactams ( Meropenem ) , Fluoroquinolones ( Levofloxacin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macrolides ( Azithromycin , Clarithromycin , etc . )\n, Sulfonamides ( Sulfisoxazole , etc . )\n, Tetracyclines , and others such as Clindamycin and Vancomycin ( typically reserved for resistant bacteria ) .\nAll in all , physicians have over 50 different choices for antibiotics .\nThe most common place to encounter antibiotic resistant bacteria is in a hospital .\nMost people who get some sort of infection in the normal routine of life , like a sinus infection or skin infection , will not likely encounter an antibiotic resistant species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the problem and that has been in the food supply .\nAntibiotics have become very popular with large scale meat production facilities of all types including beef , poultry , swine , and even fish .\nThese include actual farms where the animals are raised as well as in the processing of the meat .\nThe overuse of antibiotics in these industries has also produced resistant forms of bacteria .\nFor example , in attempts to limit the bacteria e. coli , common to mammalians , antibiotics have been used and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of e. coli .\nAn infection via e. coli ( antibiotic resistant or not ) can be avoided by proper cooking and handling of meats .\nHowever , sometimes that does not happen and there are e. coli outbreaks ( also from improperly washed vegetables that may use contaminated irrigation water ) .\nFor most healthy people , experiencing e. coli ( either resistant or not ) is only a passing discomfort that includes intestinal cramps , diarrhea , and other GI complaints .\nDepending on the amount of contamination , a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or for several days .\nBut , with some people , it can be serious or deadly ( such as in elderly people in poor health and young children ) .\nIf that occurs , then the presence of an antibiotic resistant form can be a serious matter .\nPresence of a non-resistant form can be treated more readily .\nA few years ago I had pneumonia ; a relatively mild case .\nI was given a choice of in-patient treatment or out-patient and it was a no-brainer .\nIf I wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handled by the normal course of antibiotics ( I was given a quinolone ) , staying at home and away from the hospital was important .\nI knew that hospital-acquired pneumonia could be a much more serious situation .\nSo , I stayed at home and easily recovered .\nThat did not mean I was guaranteed getting a more serious resistant form in the hospital but I understood that the risk was much greater .\nProducing more antibiotics and giving them on subscription to the users is not the answer .\nThat will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there will be this continuing loop of antibiotic use .\nBut , if the actual goal is societal addiction to antibiotics out of fear , just like addiction to universal Covid jjabs out of fear , then it makes sense .\nFinding a few universal antibiotics that deal with the resistant forms is important and it is also important to use those sparingly and only as a last resort .\nIn addition , better management of antibiotic use in our society would go a long way to attenuating the problem .\nThere is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was accepted by nearly every responsible health professional only two years ago .\nBut we live now in different times of extreme experimentation , such as the deployment of world-wide lockdowns for a virus that had a highly focused impact , with catastrophic results for the world .\nIt was the WEF on March 21 , 2020 that assured us \u201c lockdowns can halt the spread of Covid-19.\n\u201d Today that article , never pulled much less repudiated , stands as probably the most ridiculous and destructive suggestion and prediction of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WEF is still at it , suggesting that same year that at least lockdowns reduced carbon emissions .\nWe can easily predict that the WEF \u2019 s call for a universal and mandated subscription plan for antibiotics \u2013 pushed with the overt intention of shoring up financial capitalization of major drug manufacturers \u2013 will meet the same fate : poor health outcomes , more power to entrenched elites , and ever less liberty for the people .", "author": "HAF", "url": "https://humansbefree.com/2022/02/the-next-step-for-the-world-economic-forum.html", "published": "Mon, 21 Feb 2022

emergency \u201d in the second book of the \u201c Great Reset \u201d series .\nIn 2021 , World Economic Forum ( WEF ) founder Schwab and Thierry Malleret , co-founder and main author of the Monthly Barometer , published a book called \u201c COVID-19 : The Great Reset \u201d .\nIn the book , they define the Great Reset as a means of addressing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purportedly exposed by the Covid pandemic .\nThe new book is titled \u201c The Great Narrative \u201d .\n\u201c The environment is on the brink of disaster and climate change is an existential threat , \u201d Schwab insists .\nAccording to Schwab , the world must be rapidly transformed according to the designs of a technocratic elite , and \u201c we \u201d must adopt the ideas and policy preferences of 50 hand-picked \u201c narrators \u201d interviewed for the book , who he describes as \u201c global thinkers and public intellectuals.\n\u201d Schwab says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of theory , \u201d serving as a \u201c call to action.\n\u201d He writes : \u201c We adopt the view that , as they recover from the pandemic and embark on a path to radical and accelerated change , our societies and economies should be \u2026 attuned to the needs of our global commons.\n\u201d Writing for The Covid World on Feb. 21 , Jordan Schachtel noted : \u201c The Great Narrative is an attempted reminder to keep us on edge .\nIt is a grand call to take sweeping \u2018 climate emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credentialed elite .\nIt relentlessly hammers home the apparent necessity of taking dramatic tyrannical action to intervene in the climate .\nAnd by intervening in the climate , he means radically reorienting every nation on earth by imposing a totalitarian global governance order.\n\u201d Climate change , according to Schwab , is the \u201c greatest collective action problem we \u2019 ve ever been confronted with , \u201d adding that \u201c humanity has never faced an endeavor more complex , ambitious , and far-reaching than arresting the collapse of our ecosystem and stabilizing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God complex , and he frequently reminds the reader of his apparently unlimited technocratic faculties , \u201d Schachtel wrote .\n\u201c He routinely reveals that he believes his group of colleagues have deity-like powers and that once they unite their overall expertise , these technocrats , once in charge of all of us , can bring about unprecedented happiness and order.\n\u201d In The Great Narrative , Schwab makes it clear that he prefers a system of state control , which , in his view , would reduce \u201c demonstrations and social unrest.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ social contract \u201d and for the consolidation of global central banks around climate action .\nIn the \u201c bioeconomy , \u201d as Schwab describes

\u2014 James Madison ( aka \u201c America \u2019 s First Politician.\n\u201d ) War is the enemy of freedom .\nAs long as America \u2019 s politicians continue to involve us in wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servicemen and women , increase the chances of terrorism and blowback domestically , and push the nation that much closer to eventual collapse , \u201c we the people \u201d will find ourselves in a perpetual state of tyranny .\nIt \u2019 s time for the U.S. government to stop policing the globe .\nThis latest crisis \u2014 America \u2019 s part in the showdown between Russia and the Ukraine \u2014 has conveniently followed on the heels of a long line of other crises , manufactured or otherwise , which have occurred like clockwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deluded , amused , and insulated from the

.\nIndeed , even if we were to put an end to all of the government \u2019 s military meddling and bring all of the troops home today , it would take decades to pay down the price of these wars and get the government \u2019 s creditors off our backs .\nWar has become a huge money-making venture , and the U.S. government , with its vast military empire , is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most Americans \u2014 brainwashed into believing that patriotism means supporting the war machine \u2014 fail to recognize is that these ongoing wars have little to do with keeping the country safe and everything to do with propping up a military industrial complex that continues to dominate , dictate and shape almost every aspect of our lives .\nConsider : We are a military culture engaged in continuous warfare .\nWe have been a nation at war for most of our existence .\nWe are a nation that makes a living from killing through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wars .\nWe are also being fed a steady diet of violence through our entertainment , news and politics .\nAll of the military equipment featured in blockbuster movies is provided \u2014 at taxpayer expense \u2014 in exchange for carefully placed promotional spots .\nBack when I was a boy growing up in the 1950s , almost every classic sci fi movie ended with the heroic American military saving the day , whether it was battle tanks in Invaders from Mars ( 1953 ) or military roadblocks in Invasion of the Body Snatchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t know then as a schoolboy was the extent to which the Pentagon was paying to be cast as America \u2019 s savior .\nBy the time my own kids were growing up , it was Jerry Bruckheimer \u2019 s blockbuster film Top Gun \u2014 created with Pentagon assistance and equipment \u2014 that boosted civic pride in the military .\nNow it \u2019 s my grandkids \u2019 turn to be awed and overwhelmed by child-focused military propaganda .\nDon \u2019 t even get me started on the war propaganda churned out by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gotten in on the gig , with the Pentagon \u2019 s entertainment office helping to sell war to the American public .\nIt \u2019 s estimated that U.S. military intelligence agencies ( including the NSA ) have influenced over 1,800 movies and TV shows .\nAnd then there are the growing number of video games , a number of which are engineered by or created for the military , which have accustomed players to interactive war play through military simulations and first-person shooter scenarios .\nThis is how you acclimate a population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultivate loyalty to a war machine .\nThis is how , to borrow from the subtitle to the 1964 film Dr. Strangelove , you teach a nation to \u201c stop worrying and love the bomb.\n\u201d As journalist David Sirota writes for Salon , \u201c [ C ] ollusion between the military and Hollywood \u2013 including allowing Pentagon officials to line edit scripts \u2014 is once again on the rise , with new television programs and movies slated to celebrate the Navy SEALs\u2026 .\nmajor Hollywood directors remain more than happy to ideologically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pro-militarist direction that the Pentagon demands in exchange for taxpayer-subsidized access to military hardware.\n\u201d Why is the Pentagon ( and the CIA and the government at large ) so focused on using Hollywood as a propaganda machine ?\nTo those who profit from war , it is \u2014 as Sirota recognizes \u2014 \u201c a \u2018 product \u2019 to be sold via pop culture products that sanitize war and , in the process , boost recruitment numbers\u2026.At a time when more and more Americans are questioning the fundamental tenets of militarism ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wars/occupations , etc . )\n, military officials are desperate to turn the public opinion tide back in a pro-militarist direction \u2014 and they know pop culture is the most effective tool to achieve that goal.\n\u201d The media , eager to score higher ratings , has been equally complicit in making ( real ) war more palatable to the public by packaging it as TV friendly .\nThis is what professor Roger Stahl refers to as the representation of a \u201c clean war \u201d : a war \u201c without victims , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c \u2018 Dehumanize destruction \u2019 by extracting all human imagery from target areas \u2026 The language used to describe the clean war is as antiseptic as the pictures .\nBombings are \u2018 air strikes.\n\u2019 A future bombsite is a \u2018 target of opportunity.\n\u2019 Unarmed areas are \u2018 soft targets.\n\u2019 Civilians are \u2018 collateral damage.\n\u2019 Destruction is always \u2018 surgical.\n\u2019 By and large , the clean war wiped the humanity of civilians from the screen \u2026 Create conditions by which war appears short , abstract , sanitized and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death : of soldiers or civilians.\n\u201d This is how you sell war to a populace that may have grown weary of endless wars : sanitize the war coverage of anything graphic or discomfiting ( present a clean war ) , gloss over the actual numbers of soldiers and civilians killed ( human cost ) , cast the business of killing humans in a more abstract , palatable fashion ( such as a hunt ) , demonize one \u2019 s opponents , and make the weapons of war a source of wonder and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of war has a name : technofetishism , \u201d explains Stahl .\n\u201c Weapons appear to take on a magical aura .\nThey become centerpieces in a cult of worship.\n\u201d \u201c Apart from gazing at the majesty of these bombs , we were also invited to step inside these high-tech machines and take them for a spin , \u201d said Stahl .\n\u201c Or if we have the means , we can purchase one of the military vehicles on the consumer market .\nNot only are we invited to fantasize about being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are routinely invited to peer through the crosshairs too .\nThese repeated modes of imaging war cultivate new modes of perception , new relationships to the tools of state violence .\nIn other words , we become accustomed to \u2018 seeing \u2019 through the machines of war.\n\u201d In order to sell war , you have to feed the public \u2019 s appetite for entertainment .\nNot satisfied with peddling its war propaganda through Hollywood , reality TV shows and embedded journalists whose reports came across as glorified promotional ads for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sports to further advance its agenda , \u201c tying the symbols of sports with the symbols of war.\n\u201d The military has been firmly entrenched in the nation \u2019 s sports spectacles ever since , having co-opted football , basketball , even NASCAR .\nThis is how you sustain the nation \u2019 s appetite for war .\nNo wonder entertainment violence is the hottest selling ticket at the box office .\nAs professor Henry Giroux points out , \u201c Popular culture not only trades in violence as entertainment , but also it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pleasure principle steeped in graphic and extreme images of human suffering , mayhem and torture.\n\u201d No wonder the government continues to whet the nation \u2019 s appetite for violence and war through paid propaganda programs ( seeded throughout sports entertainment , Hollywood blockbusters and video games ) \u2014what Stahl refers to as \u201c militainment \u201c \u2014that glorify the military and serve as recruiting tools for America \u2019 s expanding military empire .\nNo wonder Americans from a very young age are being groomed to enlist as foot soldiers\u2014even virtual ones\u2014in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s also the name of a first person shooter video game produced by the military ) .\nExplorer Scouts , for example , are one of the most popular recruiting tools for the military and its civilian counterparts ( law enforcement , Border Patrol , and the FBI ) .\nNo wonder the United States is the number one consumer , exporter and perpetrator of violence and violent weapons in the world .\nSeriously , America spends more money on war than the combined military budgets of China , Russia , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saudi Arabia , India , Germany , Italy and Brazil .\nAmerica polices the globe , with 800 military bases and troops stationed in 160 countries .\nMoreover , the war hawks have turned the American homeland into a quasi-battlefield with military gear , weapons and tactics .\nIn turn , domestic police forces have become roving extensions of the military \u2014 a standing army .\nWe are dealing with a sophisticated , far-reaching war machine that has woven itself into the very fabric of this nation .\nClearly , our national priorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nEventually , all military empires fall and fail by spreading themselves too thin and spending themselves to death .\nIt happened in Rome : at the height of its power , even the mighty Roman Empire could not stare down a collapsing economy and a burgeoning military .\nProlonged periods of war and false economic prosperity largely led to its demise .\nThe American Empire \u2014 with its endless wars waged by U.S. military servicepeople who have been reduced to little more than guns for hire : outsourced , stretched too thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police the globe\u2014is approaching a breaking point .\nThe government is destabilizing the economy , destroying the national infrastructure through neglect and a lack of resources , and turning taxpayer dollars into blood money with its endless wars , drone strikes and mounting death tolls .\nThis is exactly the scenario President Dwight D. Eisenhower warned against when he cautioned the citizenry not to let the profit-driven war machine endanger our liberties or democratic processes .\nEisenhower , who served as Supreme Commander of the Allied forces in Europe during World War II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the profit-driven war machine that , in order to perpetuate itself , would have to keep waging war .\nYet as Eisenhower recognized , the consequences of allowing the military-industrial complex to wage war , exhaust our resources and dictate our national priorities are beyond grave : \u201c Every gun that is made , every warship launched , every rocket fired signifies , in the final sense , a theft from those who hunger and are not fed , those who are cold and are not clothed .\nThis world in arms is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending the sweat of its laborers , the genius of its scientists , the hopes of its children .\nThe cost of one modern heavy bomber is this : a modern brick school in more than 30 cities .\nIt is two electric power plants , each serving a town of 60,000 population .\n\u201c It is two fine , fully equipped hospitals .\nIt is some 50 miles of concrete highway .\nWe pay for a single fighter with a half million bushels of wheat .\nWe pay for a single destroyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 8,000 people .\nThis , I repeat , is the best way of life to be found on the road the world has been taking .\nThis is not a way of life at all , in any true sense .\nUnder the cloud of threatening war , it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron.\n\u201d The illicit merger of the armaments industry and the government that Eisenhower warned against has come to represent perhaps the greatest threat to the nation today .\nWhat we have is a confluence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere comparisons to Rome .\nIt is a union of Orwell \u2019 s 1984 with its shadowy , totalitarian government \u2014 i.e.\n, fascism , the union of government and corporate powers \u2014 and a total surveillance state with a military empire extended throughout the world .\nAs I make clear in my book Battlefield America : The War on the American People and in its fictional counterpart The Erik Blair Diaries , this is how tyranny rises and freedom falls .\nThe growth of and reliance on militarism as the solution for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill for the constitutional principles which form the basis of the American experiment in freedom .\nAs author Aldous Huxley warned : \u201c Liberty can not flourish in a country that is permanently on a war footing , or even a near-war footing .\nPermanent crisis justifies permanent control of

use one in self-defense .\nIndeed , while it still technically remains legal to own a firearm in America , possessing one can now get you pulled over , searched , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveillance , treated as a suspect without ever having committed a crime , shot at , and killed .\nAmericans no longer have a right to private property .\nIf government agents can invade your home , break down your doors ,

property .\nAmericans no longer have a say about what their children are exposed to in school .\nIncredibly , the government continues to insist that parents essentially forfeit their rights when they send their children to a public school .\nThis growing tension over whether young people , especially those in the public schools , are essentially wards of the state , to do with as government officials deem appropriate , in defiance of the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their parents , is at the heart of almost every debate over educational programming , school discipline , and the extent to which parents have any say over their children \u2019 s wellbeing in and out of school .\nAmericans are powerless in the face of militarized police forces .\nWith local police agencies acquiring military-grade weaponry , training and equipment better suited for the battlefield , Americans are finding their once-peaceful communities transformed into military outposts patrolled by a standing military army .\nAmericans no longer have a right to bodily integrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad territory , ranging from abortion and euthanasia to forced blood draws , biometric surveillance and basic healthcare .\nForced vaccinations , forced cavity searches , forced colonoscopies , forced blood draws , forced breath-alcohol tests , forced DNA extractions , forced eye scans , forced inclusion in biometric databases : these are just a few ways in which Americans continue to be reminded that we have no control over what happens to our bodies during an encounter with government officials

entered the age of authoritarianism , where all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so-called elected officials represent the interests of the corporate power elite .\nThis topsy-turvy travesty of law and government has become America \u2019 s new normal .\nAmericans can no longer rely on the courts to mete out justice .\nThe U.S. Supreme Court was intended to be an institution established to intervene and protect the people against the government and its agents when they overstep their bounds .\nYet through their deference to police power , preference for security over freedom , and evisceration of our most basic rights for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the justices of the Supreme Court have become the architects of the American police state in which we now live , while the lower courts have appointed themselves courts of order , concerned primarily with advancing the government \u2019 s agenda , no matter how unjust or illegal .\nI haven \u2019 t even touched on the corporate state , the military industrial complex , SWAT team raids , invasive surveillance technology , zero tolerance policies in the schools , overcriminalization , or privatized prisons , to name just a few , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to show that the landscape of our freedoms has already changed dramatically from what it once was and will no doubt continue to deteriorate unless Americans can find a way to wrest back control of their government and reclaim their freedoms .\nThis steady slide towards tyranny , meted out by militarized local and federal police and legalistic bureaucrats , has been carried forward by each successive president over the past seventy-plus years regardless of their political affiliation .\nThe more things change , the more they stay the same .\nBig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights of the citizenry have grown smaller .\nWe are walking a dangerous path right now .\nHaving allowed the government to expand and exceed our reach , we find ourselves on the losing end of a tug-of-war over control of our country

government can only go as far as \u201c we the people \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The pickle we find ourselves in speaks volumes about the nature of the government beast we have been saddled with and how it views the rights and sovereignty of \u201c we the people.\n\u201d Now you don \u2019 t hear a lot about sovereignty anymore .\nSovereignty is a dusty , antiquated term that harkens back to an age when kings and emperors ruled with absolute power over a populace that had no rights .\nAmericans turned the idea of sovereignty on its head when they declared their independence from Great Britain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ III .\nIn doing so , Americans claimed for themselves the right to self-government and established themselves as the ultimate authority and power .\nIn other words , in America , \u201c we the people \u201d \u2014 sovereign citizens \u2014 call the shots .\nSo when the government acts , it is supposed to do so at our bidding and on our behalf , because we are the rulers .\nThat \u2019 s not exactly how it turned out , though , is it ?\nIn the 200-plus years since we boldly embarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been steadily losing ground to the government \u2019 s brazen power grabs , foisted upon us in the so-called name of national security .\nWe have relinquished control over the most intimate aspects of our lives to government officials who , while they may occupy seats of authority , are neither wiser , smarter , more in tune with our needs , more knowledgeable about our problems , nor more aware of what is really in our best interests .\nThe government has knocked us off our rightful throne .\nIt has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staged the ultimate coup .\nIts agents no longer even pretend that they answer to \u201c we the people.\n\u201d Worst of all , \u201c we the people \u201d have become desensitized to this constant undermining of our freedoms .\nHow do we reconcile the Founders \u2019 vision of the government as an entity whose only purpose is to serve the people with the police state \u2019 s insistence that the government is the supreme authority , that its power trumps that of the people themselves , and that it may exercise that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( that includes government agents crashing through doors , mass arrests , ethnic cleansing , racial profiling , indefinite detentions without due process , and internment camps ) ?\nThey can not be reconciled .\nThey are polar opposites .\nWe are fast approaching a moment of reckoning where we will be forced to choose between the vision of what America was intended to be ( a model for self-governance where power is vested in the people ) and the reality of what it has become ( a police state where power is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are repeating the mistakes of history \u2014 namely , allowing a totalitarian state to reign over us .\nFormer concentration camp inmate Hannah Arendt warned against this when she wrote : \u201c No matter what the specifically national tradition or the particular spiritual source of its ideology , totalitarian government always transformed classes into masses , supplanted the party system , not by one-party dictatorships , but by mass movement , shifted the center of power from the army to the police , and established a foreign policy openly directed toward world domination.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nAldous Huxley predicted that eventually the government would find a way of : \u201c making people love their servitude , and producing dictatorship without tears , so to speak , producing a kind of painless concentration camp for entire societies , so that people will in fact have their liberties taken away from them , but will rather enjoy it , because they will be distracted from any desire to rebel by propaganda or brainwashing , or brainwashing enhanced by pharmacological methods .\nAnd this seems to be the final revolution.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowing yourself to be distracted and diverted .\nLearn your rights .\nStand up for the founding principles .\nMake your voice and your vote count for more than just political posturing .\nNever cease to vociferously protest the erosion of your freedoms at the local and national level .\nMost of all , do these things

Kennedy Jr is what the CIA and its media mouthpieces have been doing for years .\nThis has become more and more necessary as they have realized the great growing danger he poses to their agenda .\nCalling him an anti-vaxxer , conspiracy theorist , and names far worse , is part of a concerted smear campaign to turn the public away from his message , which is multi-faceted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nLike his father and uncle , he has become an irrepressibly eloquent opponent of the demonic forces intent on destroying the democratic dream .\nThe Times article by Adam Nagourney is a blatant hatchet job filled with sly jabs , innuendos , and ignorant lies .\nAs is par for the course , his hack piece completely avoids Kennedy \u2019 s arguments but relies on a form of social gossip that substitutes for logic and evidence .\nHe seems to have learned much from The National Enquirer and The New York Post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ styles the NY Times has emulated .\nNagourney tells the reader that RFK Jr \u2019 s work as the face of the jjab resistance movement has \u201c tested , \u201d \u201c rattled , \u201d \u201c anguished , \u201d and \u201c mystified \u201d family , friends and his Hollywood crowd ; that this man \u201c of the often troubled life \u201d has effectively used his talent and one of the most prominent names in American political history as a platform for fueling resistance to jjabs that could save countless lives.\n\u201d Translation : Kennedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addict , is so mentally unbalanced that he will betray his family and friends and kill people with medical advice that runs counter to the truth .\nNo evidence is required to establish this \u201c truth , \u201d just Nagourney \u2019 s word and those of those he can get to say the same thing , in other words .\nSuch as : His conduct \u2018 undercuts 50 years of public health jjab practice , and he \u2019 s done it in a way I \u2019 ve never see [ sic ] anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T. Osterholm , the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota .\n\u2018 He is among the most dangerous because of the credibility of who he is and what his family name has brought to this issue.\n\u2019 Notice the implication : that these experimental mRNA so-called jjabs have been around 50 years and Kennedy is against all jjabs , both of which are false .\nFurthermore , Nagourney says RFK Jr not only \u201c inveighs \u201d against jjabs , especially Covid vaccinations , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views ( implication : orthodox views are good ) over the years .\nOne is his claim that Sirhan Sirhan did not kill his father Senator Robert F. Kennedy .\nNagourney might do a smidgen of research and discover that Kennedy is correct ; but doing so would disrupt the flow of his ad hominem attack .\nAll serious writers on the case know that the senator was not shot by Sirhan ; they know there are deep CIA connections to the assassination .\nThe evidence conclusively proves , as the autopsy has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the senator when he fired his pistol but RFK was shot from the rear at very close range with all bullets entering his body from the rear .\nNagourney either knows nothing about the assassination or is dissembling the facts , which must be \u201c unorthodox.\n\u201d Sounding like a US government spokesmen telling the press something is true without an iota of evidence , he writes the following sentence as if it were true simply because he wrote it , while making sure not to mention the book \u2019 s title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Big Pharma , and the Global War on Democracy \u2013 a brilliant , deeply researched and sourced book The Times will not review : In a best-selling new book , he claimed that Dr Anthony S. Fauci , who is President Biden \u2019 s top medical adviser for the coronavirus pandemic , and Billy Boy , the co-founder of Microsoft , were in cahoots with the pharmaceutical industry to profiteer off dangerous jjabs .\nNotice Nagourney \u2019 s insidious method .\nState RFK \u2019 s claim as if it \u2019 s false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact it is so abundantly true and backed up by massive evidence that if Nagourney dared to engage in actual journalism by checking Kennedy \u2019 s book he would discover it .\nBut his job is not to search for truth but to defile a man \u2019 s reputation .\nHe accuses Kennedy of circulating false information on the coronavirus and the jjabs but of course doesn \u2019 t say what that is or why it is false .\nHis entire article is an ad hominem attack by statement with the author cunningly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public distress of his wife , the actress Cheryl Hines , Mr. Kennedy invoked Anne Frank , the young German-Dutch diarist who died in a Nazi prison camp , as he compared government measures for containing the pandemic with the Holocaust at that rally in Washington .\nHowever , that is not what he said .\nHe said that during the Holocaust Anne Frank could hide for a while and others could flee out of Germany , but with the new \u201c turnkey totalitarianism \u201d being introduced today , which is technological , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for every aspect of life will be monitored by the authorities in a digital dystopia .\nSuch a perspective is in no way unusual , for it is shared by many scholars of technology and only the most na\u00efve would consider it eccentric .\nHis point and words were twisted to serve others \u2019 purposes and to paint him as an insensitive Holocaust denier .\nHere \u2019 s what he said : What we \u2019 re seeing today is what I call turnkey totalitarianism .\nThey are putting in place all of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen before .\nIt \u2019 s been the ambition of every totalitarian state since the beginning of mankind to control every aspect of behavior , of conduct , of thought and to obliterate dissent .\nNone of them have been able to do it .\nThey didn \u2019 t have the technological capacity .\nEven in Hitler \u2019 s Germany , you could cross the Alps into Switzerland .\nYou could hide in an attic like Anne Frank did .\nI visited in 1962 East Germany with my father and met people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so it was possible .\nMany died \u2026 but it was possible .\nYet his sister Kerry also ripped him for making a statement that was clearly true if you accept his argument about the technological lockdowns in progress .\nYou can disagree ( I don \u2019 t ) but to impugn his intentions and his words is really despicable , but Nagourney adds it to his ad hominem attacks , making sure to include his sister Kerry \u2019 s Tweet : Bobby \u2019 s lies and fear-mongering yesterday were both sickening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his hateful rhetoric .\nNagourney : \u201c Even his most prominent critics say they do not doubt his sincerity , even as he has become one of the most prominent spreaders of misinformation on jjabs.\n\u201d Big Daddy Fauci is introduced to tell the young whippersnapper the following after Kennedy delivered a briefing at The National Institutes of Health : When it was over , Dr Fauci walked Mr Kennedy out of the conference room .\n\u201c I said , \u2018 Bobby , I \u2019 m sorry we didn \u2019 t come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said .\n\u201c \u2018 Although I disagree factually with everything you are saying , I do understand and I respect that deep down you are really concerned about the safety of children.\n\u2019 I said that in a very sincere way.\n\u201d Condescension and sincerity overflow as the \u201c conspiracy theorist \u201d patient is told by the good doctor that he means well but needs help .\nThen , making sure to include The New York Times endlessly repeated CIA talking point , our no-nothing author writes : The assassination of President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1963 , when Robert was 9 , helped foster a modern culture of conspiracy theories .\nNow , many of the arguments that Mr Kennedy has embraced \u2014 including that Dr Fauci is part of a \u201c historic coup d \u2019 \u00e9tat against Western democracy \u201d \u2014 recall the theories of a secret assassin helping Lee Harvey Oswald from the grassy knoll in Dallas .\nThat it was the CIA that weaponized the use of the term \u201c conspiracy theory \u201d in a 1967 dispatch \u2013 # 1035-960 \u2013 in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its cover-up of the CIA \u2019 s role in JFK \u2019 s assassination is another fact that our fair-minded scribe conveniently omits while insidiously implying that Lee Harvey Oswald killed JFK .\nYes , there are magic bullets and magical tricks used to make sure RFK , Jr. is seen as a \u201c sincere \u201d nutcase .\nRFK Jr has been and is an astute critic of the CIA and all its machinations , including its involvement in the assassinations of his uncle JFK , his father Senator Robert F. Kennedy , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its extensive deadly deeds and disinformation at home and abroad .\nHis critical siblings praise him for his great intelligence and political acumen but seem clueless themselves .\nSo they ally with the same media that have been stenographers for the CIA .\nThe Kennedy family may be very well known , but in these ways they are very typical of American families that are divided by those who know and those who don \u2019 t know who the real devils are .\nBut let me make two final points about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jr has spent decades as an environmental lawyer fighting the pollution of our air , earth , and water .\nIn other words , the pollution also of human beings who live in nature while nature lives in us .\nSome people know the outside and the inside are connected .\nYet Nagourney bemoans the tragic turn he took from such good work with the environment to such terrible work with Children \u2019 s Health Defense and jjabs .\nHe writes : The swerve in Mr Kennedy \u2019 s career , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because for many family members and other Kennedy associates , Robert Kennedy Jr is the sibling who most recalls the level of charisma and political appeal of his late father .\nStartling ?\nNo , very consistent for one who can think .\nThere is an obvious link between the major corporate polluters of the outside environment and the major polluters of human bodies .\nBig pharmaceutical , oil , chemical , agribusiness , military , etc .\nare an interrelated lot of criminal enterprises despoiling all life on earth .\nKennedy \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trajectory and underlying it all is his critique of the CIA and its media accomplices , such as The New York Times .\nYes , those family and friends who say he \u2019 s brilliant are right , and he is following in his father \u2019 s footsteps in ways they do not grasp ; for he is able to connect the dots , diagnose the patterns , and expose with facts the criminal syndicates that are destroying democracy and so many lives .\nThe reason The New York Times publishes hit pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent books is because his critique of these nefarious forces has gained a large audience and as a result many people are awakening to the truths concealed by the likes of \u201c the paper of record \u201d with its propaganda .\nHit pieces like Nagourney \u2019 s should cause anyone reading it intense \u201c anguish.\n\u201d There is nothing \u201c mystifying \u201d about it .", "author": "HAF", "url":

large international investors buy out Ukrainian government \u2019 s securities .\nFranklin Templton is one of them .\nThe investment group snapped up Ukrainian international debt with a face value of almost $ 5 billion at the end of August , nearly a fifth of the country \u2019 s outstanding international government bonds .\nFranklin Templton has all the makings of a \u00ab financial vulture

to be in the hands of financial vultures that spoiled it all by demanding full payment .\nThe vultures ( two US investment funds ) started court proceedings to make Argentina default .\nThe country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complies with the ultimatums of vultures and the ruling of US court .\nThe story is a warning to Ukraine which has sold its securities to Franklin Templton .\nAccording to a recent Bloomberg report , the investment fund acts under US jurisdiction and is controlled by Rothschilds , the family known for its death grip .\nLast year I wrote in my article The Financial Situation of Kiev Regime and Prospects for Ukraine \u2019 s Default that Ukraine may face the very same default that \u00ab will never come \u00bb according the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk .\nSome may lose billions , some may acquire unprecedented wealth .\nAs the global experience shows , defaults are seldom impromptu .\nNormally they are planned .\nSometimes the preparations may last for a few years .\nUkraine is not an exclusion .\nIt will default on its debts .\nThe time will be defined by sponsors and modest beneficiaries of such organizations as Franklin Thompson .\nAt the moment of writing the article I did not know their names .\nNow they have come into the open .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ drama is nearing its denouement .\nThe Rothschilds family [ which is the head of the New World Order beast ] has come up with an initiative to create a group of Ukrainian bonds holders to shape a common policy on debt settlement .\nRothschild & Cie Banque , a French bank belonging to Rothschild Group , offered its service in the capacity of \u00ab go-between \u00bb in the talks of Ukraine \u2019 s Ministry of Finances and creditors on restructuring the debt .\nNow creditors are waiting for Kiev to put forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Giovanni Salvetti , Co-head of Russia and CIS at Rothschild Inc. , who handles central and Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States .\nSalvetti said there were two opinions among creditors about setting up the committee : those who want to wait and see what the government will say and those who want to set \u00ab some hard lines for the potential restructuring , like saying we \u2019 re looking for a proposal but be aware that we are not ready to accept X , Y , Z.\n\u00bb The Bloomberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it allows to make the following conclusions : first , the default of Ukraine is inevitable and the credit holders are aware of this fact , second , the default will be accompanied by restructuring on tough terms unfavorable for Ukraine .\nOne detail strikes an eye \u2013 the leak on the coming default and debt restructuring coincided with the announcement made by the International Monetary Fund that on March 11 it signed off on an USD17.5

investment and credit rating .\nVersion three .\nThe decision is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money but not for some ephemeral \u00ab program of economic stabilization \u00bb .\nThe purpose is to guarantee that Franklin Templeton and other financial marauders acting under the disguise of respectable \u00ab investment funds \u00bb get full payment on Ukraine \u2019 s securities .\nIf so , the Rothschilds and the International Monetary Fund do effectively coordinate their activities .\nThe security holders are confident in inevitability of Ukraine \u2019 s default .\nIn this case the country will be ruled by duumvirate of US government and world financial oligarchy on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be signed in Kiev with the Rothschilds .\nIt can be presumed , that the agreement will confirm the consent of

first step , the western population or Global North \u2013 many or most of them are considered by the ruling elite , \u201c useless eaters and consumers \u201d .\nAround the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumption of natural resources exceeded the factor \u201c 1 \u201d ( one ) of what Mother Earth is generally providing .\nThis over-consumption reaches today , in the early 2020s , factors 3.5 to 4.5 between Europe and the US of Mother Nature \u2019 s offerings .\nThis refers not just to food \u2013 which , after all , is a renewable resource \u2014 but primarily to non-renewable resources , one of which is hydrocarbon .\nFossil fuels in mid-2020 ( the year of the COVID lockdown ) accounted for 84 % ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy used worldwide .\nAn increase of 4 % was projected for 2021 .\nOn food : As an example , Eurostat ( 2018 ) reports that in the EU about 88 million tons of food waste are generated per year , at a cost of about 143 billion euros .\nThis corresponds to about 20 % of total food produced .\nAccording to FAO , worldwide approximately a third of all food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted \u2013 see this .\n\u2022 A huge shift of capital and assets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle class ( mostly small- and medium-sized enterprises ) to the top .\nAccording to Forbes , 2021 accounted for 2,755 billionaires worldwide , an increase of 660 new ones over 2020 .\nAltogether

congruent with what he also calls the Fourth Industrial Revolution .\nAll-digitization allows for full control of everything .\nDespite all the widely propagated , so-called loosening of COVID

, of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of multi-cultural European countries beginning in the mid-sixties European nations \u2019 sovereignty and independence gradually melted away .\nThis was never a European idea ,

do .\nFor decades they have complied with this rule .\nBut , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , didn \u2019 t believe it , or were too complacent and blind in our comfort to see it .\nThis planned and aspired world domination by a super-rich and a super-sick elite has started decades ago , at least since WWII , probably earlier .\nWhile we could go back much further , this is just to mention a few of these open warnings within the last couple of decades .\n\u2022 The 2010 Rockefeller Report .\nIt outlined in four simple steps and chapters what was planned and what would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lockstep \u201d phase , where people would be stunned , shocked , isolated and made fearful and totally submissive to authorities ( \u00e0 la Naomi Klein \u2019 s \u201c The Shock Doctrine \u201d ) , from things not visible including an invisible \u2013 and never isolated \u2013 virus , all the way to the final phase of full digitization and total control .\n\u2022 Billy Boy \u2019 February 2010 TedTalk , \u201c Innovating to Zero \u201d in which he infamously said : \u201c If we are really doing a good job [ jjabing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population by between 10 % and 15 % \u201d ( about minute four of the video ) .\n\u2022 The June 2016 ( Swiss ) depicting a Luciferian ceremony beginning with a Lockstep scenario and ending with the total submission of the people .\nIt was attended mostly by European politicians in lead positions \u2013 and , in hindsight , many of those who attended went to Klaus Schwab \u2019 s \u201c academy \u201d for Young Global Leaders .\nSee this 6-minute video clip .\n\u2022 Event 201 \u2013 An open simulation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on 18 October 2019 in NYC , organized by The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation .\nThe event depicted a high-level pandemic exercise with participants from the World Bank , IMF , various agencies of the UN system , including WHO and UNICEF and many more , illustrating \u201c areas where public / private partnerships will be necessary during the response to a severe pandemic in order to diminish large-scale economic and societal consequences.\n\u201d For more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe rest is history .\nIn the meantime we know how large-scale economic and societal consequences were avoided or diminished .\nTo the contrary , they were intended to hit the population as severely as possible , to cause utmost shock , fear , financial , physical and emotional damage .\nThe Role of the Financial Giants They \u2013 the masters behind the WEF and above all 193 UN member countries , the collective trillionaires of this world and their ( so far ) all-commanding financial institutions like , BlackRock , Vanguard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advancing at relentless pace on several fronts and in several dimensions .\nThese financial giants are largely inter-woven through mutual shareholderships and inter-changeable management positions .\nTogether , they control some US $ 20 to 25 trillion of assets , giving them a leverage power in excess of 100 trillion dollars ( the world \u2019 s 2021 GDP US $ 95 trillion , IMF estimate \u2013 see this ) .\nWith such powers it is possible to coerce , force , or blackmail everyone nation of the 193 UN members to chant and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether or not they agree with the root purpose of such coercion .\nHence , WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 , and a pandemic on 11 March 2020 .\nAs we know by now , a lockdown and plandemic and all the repressive covid measures , that have nothing , but nothing to do with health , but only with the ulterior goal of installing a global One World Government with absolute and total control over everything , including all surviving citizens , In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manipulable transhumans , modern slaves that own nothing but are happy ( Klaus Schwab \u2013 The Great Reset ) .\nThis agenda is advancing despite people \u2019 s protests throughout the globe , and despite the \u201c fake \u201d loosening of covid restrictions throughout the world , predominantly the western world .\nWith almost all covid restrictions lifted in the western world , be aware and conscious , not to fall into the trap of illusions , that all is over now and that we are back to \u201c normal \u201d .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of an ongoing psychological warfare .\nIt \u2019 s a strategy to shock you again into submission , to clamp down even further in the fall , or before .\nIf We , the People , let it happen .\nWe are just entering Phase 6 of the Great Reset \u2013 full digitization : Agenda ID2020 , fully integrated into the QR codification of everything , digital money \u2013 towards total and absolute control \u2013 and transhumanism .\nPrecursors to the final blow may be artificially produced inflation ( in the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] , expected to move into double-digits by fall 2022 , or before ) , rising interest rates , further rising debt driven by all the COVID-induced subsidies , more \u201c new \u201d money put in circulation without any economic backing \u2013 all to be \u201c balanced \u201d and \u201c resolved \u201d by a ( sudden ) debt-wipe-out and introduction of digital money , over which governments and banks have full control on behalf of the world financial elite .\nBut again , only if We , the People , let it happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 as part of the renewed socio-psychological fear domination , possibly the application of the \u201c shock doctrine \u201d through a serious disease , like Ebola , tested in West Africa in 2014 .\nEarlier this year , French Prime Minister Jean Castex , warned of possibly postponing France \u2019 s Presidential election in April 2022 , due to a possible outbreak of Marburg ( Ebola ) disease .\nAny reference to this statement has disappeared from internet .\nIt may have been simply a fearmongering remark .\nWhatever may happen , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more experimental \u201c gene-therapy \u201d , many more deaths before closure of Agenda 2030 .\nNothing is beyond evil , for these un-people .\nBut there is nothing that can not be successfully fought , if We the People , collectively and solidarily put our minds , conscience and spirits together .\nIt is never too late , in fact it is high time , to step up protests , to step up our conscious rejection of this monster tyranny that is descending on Mother Earth , threatening full annihilation of whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or at least of civilization as we know it .\nWe can not idle .\nTime is precious and is of the essence .\nIf anyone still doubts that we are in the fangs of a worldwide drive towards a One World Order , a Global Government led by extraordinary financial interests , but also by a cult of power-thirsty megalomaniacs , then think again .\nThe world is in deep trouble .\nIf anything \u201c globalist \u201d has to happen , it is a global awakening .\nFast .\nWhat is occurring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishment of a global tyranny ; a tyranny directed and led by the World Economic Forum .\nIt is obvious that the financial elite and the all-controlling top financial institutions , such as BlackRock , Vanguard , State Street and Fidelity , plus some obscure multi-multi billionaires , are calling the shots .\nThe WEF complies with an agenda well and by long-hand prepared \u2013 we are talking decades \u2013 implementing this nefarious , diabolical plan which also goes under the anodyne name of UN Agenda 2030 .\nAbsolute must-read

.\nEspecially those countries for which the WEF selected its WEF-trained leaders .\nFor three decade the WEF has been \u201c educating \u201d young promising politicians , artists , industrialists ( Volkswagen , the Coca Cola Company , BP Amoco and more ) \u2013 but foremost politicians \u2013 to become so-called \u201c Young Global Leaders \u201d ( YGL ) .\nAmong those that went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angela Merkel , Germany ; Sarkozy , Macron , France ; Jacinda Ardern , Prime Minister , New Zealand ; Scott Morrison , PM , Australia \u2013 and many more .\nBut outstanding is Justin Trudeau , Canada

Canadian people , but for the global objectives of the WEF .\nTrudeau is an instrument of the WEF .\nTo strengthen the ties with the WEF , Trudeau is assisted by Chrystia Freeland , Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WEF \u2019 s Board of Trustees .\nThe Board of Trustees serves as the guardian of the World Economic Forum \u2019 s mission and values \u2013 see this .\nPrime

drafting a pandemic treaty based on an already existing international legal instrument called the International Health Regulations ( 2005 ) , also known as the IHR .\nThe stated purpose of the IHR is to : \u201c Prevent , protect against , control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks , and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade.\n\u201d In the event that another deadly bioweapon gets released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bioweapons laboratories in Ukraine , for

by what already took place as part of the Wuhan coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) plandemic .\nNow , the WHO wants even more power for the next one , which the powers-that-be are already hinting is soon to come .\n\u201c Indeed , it was in January 2020 , that pursuant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WHO Director-General ( the \u2018 Director-General \u2019 ) declared that the COVID-19 was a \u2018 public health emergency of international concern \u2019 ( a \u2018 PHEIC \u2019 ) , setting off a worldwide tidal wave of highly restrictive government health policies resulting in lockdowns , mandatory masking ,

never imagine .\nDespite the fact that he was famous but not as much as he should have been , as most of the patents were registered by Edison or Westinghouse , Tesla himself , was altruistic , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he probably wished them well .\nHe wasn \u2019 t financially motivated beyond survival , and he sought to share his ideas with the entire world , either by him or by others .\nOne of his most floated theories is Tesla 3 6 9 Number Theory .\nMysterious things Tesla used to do Tesla did countless mysterious experiments , but he was a whole other mystery on his own .\nAs a famous saying goes \u201c The greatest minds are always curious \u201d , goes well on Nikola Tesla .\n\u2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had its room number divisible by 3 \u2022 He would wash his dishes with 18

may have come across this quote claiming to be said by Tesla all over the internet , but there is no reference anywhere to it is being truly said by him .\nEven though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts and things Tesla used to do make it more believable that he was obsessed with these numbers and it can conclude the quote to be genuine .\nMoreover , the significance of number three just not known by Tesla but a lot of other people of this era relate to the number three .\nIt could make more sense taking real-life examples , from an atom consisting of three subatomic particles ( proton , neutron , and electron ) , to Holy Trinity ( God , Jesus , and Holy Spirit ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also featured three gods that represented heaven , earth , and the abyss .\nMoreover , the evolution of our ideas are from the Past , our experience is always the Present , and all our imaginations and aspirations are of the Future making the three Kaal ( Sanskrit for Time ) .\nThe Nikola Tesla 3 6 9 theory or the key to the universe Nikola Tesla was obsessed with numbers , but especially 3 , 6 , and 9 .\nHe wanted the world to know the significance of the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these were extremely important numbers , but the question is why ?\nWhat was that Nikola Tesla wanted the world to understand ?\nHow it becomes Nikola Tesla 3 6 9 theory ?\nTo understand that , we must first know about Mathematics .\nWhy it is so different yet the same anywhere in the universe .\nMath was and has been the most valued subject of all time and the most powerful too .\nTwo plus two will always be four everywhere in the universe .\nPossibly , Nikola Tesla knew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe Golden ratio in Mathematics is a special number found by dividing a line into two parts such that the longer part divided by the smaller part is also equal to the whole length divided by the longer part .\nIt is often symbolized using phi , after the 21st letter of the Greek alphabet .\nIn an equation form , it looks like this : The Golden ratio was used to achieve balance and beauty in many Renaissance paintings and sculptures .\nDa Vinci himself used the Golden ratio to define @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including the dimensions of the table and the proportions of the walls and backgrounds .\nThe Golden ratio also appears in da Vinci \u2019 s Vitruvian Man and the Mona Lisa .\nThere are patterns that naturally occur in The Universe , patterns we \u2019 ve discovered in life , galaxies , star formations , evolution , and almost all natural systems , and The Golden Ratio is one of them .\nBeing said that , Mathematics was and still is one of the most powerful and important languages , used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers is the cradle of all creations .\nWithout this , the world can not move even an inch .\nEvery human being , everyone , needs mathematics in their day-to-day life .\nEven animals , plants , and insects have the Golden ratio , the geometrical pattern , they use mathematics in their everyday life for existence .\nThere must have been at least some reason that Tesla was obsessed with equations and numbers .\nIn Vortex Math ( Science of Torus Anatomy ) .\nif you follow a specific pattern as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have something like this : As you can see , starting with 1 , and doubling it ( 1+1 ) we got 2 , again , doubling 2 ( 2+2 ) we got 4 .\nFurther doubling 32 ( 32+32 ) we got 64 and summing up 6+4 gave us 10 which again summing up the two digits gave us 1 .\nIf you keep following this pattern , It will always give us the digits 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 .\nEven summing 7+7 gives 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNotice how 3 , 6 , and 9 are not in this pattern .\nScientist Marko Rodin ( Discoverer of Vortex Maths ) believes these numbers represent a vector from the third to fourth dimension which he calls a \u201c flux field.\n\u201d This field is supposed to be higher dimensional energy that influences the energy circuit of the other six points ( 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 ) .\nThings start getting strange from here \u2026 If you take these 3 numbers ( 3 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 and doubling it ( 3 + 3 = 6 ; 6 + 6 = 12 ; 1 + 2 = 3 ) , you will find that there is no mention of 9 !\nWe find lots of evidence that nature uses threefold and sixfold symmetry , including the hexagonal tile shape of the common honeycomb .\nInterestingly not just in nature but also the ancient establishments have this symmetry .\nOne of the greatest of them all is the Giza \u2013 Orion correlation theory .\nAccording to which there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest pyramids of the Giza and Orion \u2019 s Belt of the constellation Orion , and that this correlation was intended as such by the original builders of the Giza pyramid complex .\nThe stars of Orion were associated with Osiris , the god of rebirth and the afterlife by

with the Milky Way galaxy .\nWe also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately away from the three larger pyramids , which makes the total number of pyramids to be 6 .\nThree pyramids correlate with the constellation Orion .\nIs it a coincidence , or there exist a significance of 3 and 6 ?\n\u201c If you want to find the secrets of the universe , think in terms of energy , frequency and vibration.\n\u201d Is it possible that there is something special about these mysterious numbers , 3 , 6 , and 9 , tesla 3 6 9 ?\nWas 3 6 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible that Tesla uncovered this profound secret and used this knowledge to push the boundaries of science and technology ?\nWe don \u2019 t know , but we definitely find it fascinating how these numbers do relate to the universe in some way .\nNow that you

panel discussions and white papers outlining a \u201c pandemic \u201d of a completely different nature ; what they referred to as an impending \u201c cyber-attack with covid like characteristics.\n\u201d The program agenda at the WEF was titled \u201c Cyber Polygon \u201d and headed with unsettling zeal by globalist Klaus Schwab .\nThe WEF and Schwab are best known for two things : 1 ) Their involvement in a war game called Event 201 which simulated the global spread of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two months BEFORE the real thing happened in early 2020 and a majority of the measures played out in the game were in fact implemented almost immediately following the outbreak .\n2 ) Klaus Schwab \u2019 s excited announcement that the pandemic was the perfect \u201c opportunity \u201d to institute what he calls the \u201c Great Reset \u201d of the global economy along with the rise of the Fourth Industrial Revolution , which is the complete centralization of world trade and governance into a global socialist empire where you will \u201c own nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it.\n\u201d World Economic Forum : By 2030 \u2018 You Will Own Nothing \u2019 ( New World Order Detailed ) .\nThe fact that the WEF was so prescient when it came to the covid pandemic was quite a miracle .\nIt was almost as if they knew it was going to happen , and their political friends in various nations wasted no time carrying out their draconian mandate policies around the world .\nBut something happened that seemed to throw a monkey wrench into the plan \u2013 Event 201 predicted an initial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but this didn \u2019 t happen .\nIn fact , the median Infection Fatality Rate of covid was only 0.27 % .\nCovid wasn \u2019 t killing enough people , and the public was starting to question the efficacy of the lockdowns , the useless mask rules and the need to take an experimental mRNA gene therapy with no long term testing to prove its safety .\nIn the US specifically , conservative states began to rise up and block the covid agenda .\nToday , the CDC and the Federal Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even leftist blue states are beginning to relent .\nHowever , most conservative red states have been without mandates for well over a year to a year-and-a-half .\nWe \u2019 ve been without restrictions this whole time , and the government is acting as if they have just \u201c allowed us \u201d to be free again .\nThe truth is , the globalists at the WEF and their partners abroad FAILED in their efforts to institute medical tyranny , at least in the US and in certain parts of Europe .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in every respect .\nThey had nothing .\nWith 99.7 % of people safe from covid , it was impossible to engineer enough fear in enough of the population to get them to relinquish their freedoms .\nSo , for those of us that have been tracking these events carefully , the alarm bells really started ringing when the WEF switched gears and suddenly shifted focus to a cyber-attack narrative .\nWas this Plan-B ?\nIn April of 2021 I published an article titled \u2018 The Globalists Will Need Another Crisis In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In that article I outlined the most likely scenarios for the next disaster event , which included war in Ukraine as well as a global cyber-attack that disrupts the supply chain .\nIn that article I stated : \u201c The media and the Biden Administration are very busy trying to create tensions with Russia over Ukraine .\nThere are renewed tensions between Iran and Israel and continued destabilization by the West in Syria .\nAnd , a rising danger of confrontation with China over Taiwan\u2026 There is \u2026 a narrative advantage to global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat , are Americans more likely to reject notions of rebellion against government trespasses ?\nI have no doubt that the establishment will try to claim the liberty movement is not a movement for freedom , but an \u201c astro-turf \u201d movement created by the Russians to destabilize America .\nThis has been the leftist media propaganda strategy for years now ; so why would they stop ?\n\u201d In June of 2021 I wrote more specifically on the suspicious nature of Cyber Polygon in my article \u2018 Cyber Polygon : Will The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Convenient Catastrophe ?\n\u2019 Then in July of 2021 I wrote an article titled \u2018 What If The Next Major Cyber Attack Targeted The Internet ?\n\u2019 In it I made this observation : \u201c In June of this year there was an internet outage event that led to large swaths of the web going dark , including a number of mainstream news sites , Amazon , eBay , Twitch , Reddit and a host of government websites went down .\nAll this happened when content delivery network ( CDN ) company Fastly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its website back online within 20 minutes , the brief outage cost the company over $ 5.5 million in sales ( and that \u2019 s just one website ! )\n.\nFastly identified and fixed the problem within two hours , and continues to claim the outage had nothing to do with a cyberattack .\nHowever , it did reveal a huge vulnerability for the internet ( what von Clausewitz would \u2019 ve called a schwerpunkt ) .\nA large portion of the web is dependent on only three CDN companies , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : If there was a cyberattack on such weak points in the web , and the attack involved a malicious worm or other highly infectious weapon , then Klaus Schwab could very well get his cyber pandemic.\n\u201d Today , the war tensions with Russia are now about to overflow and I suspect it \u2019 s only a matter of time before China also begins operations against Taiwan .\nBut there is a much bigger threat on the horizon .\nI have little doubt at this stage that a false flag attack on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) is now imminent , and what I mean by \u201c false flag \u201d is that the attack will be designed to benefit the globalists and not necessarily the country that is blamed for it .\nAs I have noted in the past , Vladimir Putin is a long time associate of numerous globalists .\nHis friendship with New World Order ghoul Henry Kissinger started decades ago and they continue to meet for regular lunches as Kissinger acts as an adviser to multiple branches of the Kremlin .\nPutin has also maintained a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even joined Klaus Schwab \u2019 s Fourth Industrial Revolution Network just last year .\nThe claim the Putin is anti-globalist is a lie , he is deeply involved in the globalist system and always has been .\nThe globalists are playing BOTH SIDES of the Ukraine conflict .\nThis is reality .\nIt \u2019 s very important to understand and accept this fact otherwise you will not be able to grasp the events that happen next .\nPutin recently threatened western governments with a reprisal the likes of which they have never seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukraine .\nThe problem is that many in the mainstream and alternative media automatically assumed this was a threat of nuclear war .\nI don \u2019 t think this is what Putin was referring to .\nI have another theory\u2026 The globalists are unlikely to spend the past several decades building up one of the most complex technocratic control grids in history to track and dominate the public only to then annihilate it all in the blink of an eye with nukes .\nA post-nuke environment would be impossible for them to control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my view , is a massive cyber-attack that targets the functionality of the internet itself , and it would have to happen relatively soon .\nThe amount of economic and business operations tied to the web is staggering .\nEven if the internet was to go down for a mere two weeks , the repercussions to our markets and to our supply chain would be devastating .\nBy extension , the benefits to the globalists would be immense .\nThey could implement filters and firewalls on any part of the web they don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media ) and claim that this is to protect the internet from possible sources of viral spread .\nThey could whittle the web down to only a handful of approved corporate and government sites all in the name of protecting the integrity of the net .\nFurthermore , such an attack would be a perfect scapegoat for the already crashing economy and rising inflation .\nAt that point , the central banks that are truly responsible for our financial instability could simply say that everything was \u201c about to go back to normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread the cyber-virus .\nAnd , maybe Russia will be involved , but it will not be Putin that gives the order , it will be his globalist partners behind the curtain .\nThe hype machine surrounding Ukraine is in overdrive right now .\nIt \u2019 s a little bizarre to me how much panic and indignance is being drummed up .\nIt \u2019 s as if people have forgotten that the US government just spent well over a decade devastating a country like Iraq for no good reason .\nNo one seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all out war against Russia when US campaigns in Iraq killed hundreds of thousands of civilians and very few countries batted an eye about it .\nClearly , the controlled media is trying to convince the western people to support direct military confrontation with Russia over a conflict that has nothing to do with us .\nThere are even numerous GOP neo-cons out there ( Lindsay Graham , I \u2019 m looking at you ) campaigning for true conservatives to go along with a war footing .\nI don \u2019 t think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what has worked as an effective manipulation against conservatives in the past ?\nThe globalists need another Pearl Harbor \u2013 A 9/11 attack or something even bigger .\nThey need something that will enrage the American population , specifically conservatives .\nThey need a crisis of epic proportions to lure us into an emotional response and the abandonment of logic .\nThey also need a scapegoat disaster that they can use to lay the blame for the impending economic crisis .\nI predict this event will come in the form of a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events suggests to me that they will try to implement such an attack in the near term .\nPerhaps within the next couple of months and certainly before the year is over .\nThis is not about Russia .\nIt \u2019 s not about Ukraine .\nThe real war is between free peoples and the globalists .\nWhen they are removed and their puppets are removed , the majority of these disasters will stop .\nAs long as they remain in power , the crisis events will only accelerate and increase in frequency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that makes most people willing to give up their liberties in exchange for the false promise of security .", "author": "HAF", "url":

ways in which the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine is the next catalyst for the World Economic Forum \u2019 s Great Reset agenda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global stakeholders and a diffuse network of public-private partnerships .\nMust-read : Very Detailed Explanation of the Great Reset and the New World Order .\n1 .\nThe war between Russia and Ukraine is already causing unprecedented disruption to global supply chains , exacerbating fuel shortages and inducing chronic levels of inflation .\nAs geopolitical tensions morph into a protracted conflict between NATO and the Sino-Russia axis , a second contraction may plunge the economy into stagflation .\nIn the years ahead , the combination of subpar growth and runaway inflation will force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and low-wage jobs in an emerging gig

lead to a dramatic downsizing of the global workforce .\nThe architects of the Great Reset have anticipated this trend for a number of years and will exploit this economic turbulence by propelling the role of disruptive technologies to meet global challenges and fundamentally alter traditional business patterns to keep pace with rapid changes in technology .\nLike the pandemic , disaster preparedness in the age of conflict will rest significantly on the willingness to embrace specific technological innovations in the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can supply the labour demands of the Great Reset .\nA recurring theme in Klaus Schwab \u2019 s Shaping the Future of the Fourth Industrial Revolution is that groundbreaking technological and scientific innovations will no longer be relegated to the physical world around us but become extensions of ourselves .\nHe emphasises the primacy of emerging technologies in a next generation workforce and highlights the urgency to push ahead with

innovations , e-strategies , telepresence labour , Artificial Intelligence , robotics , nanotechnology , the Internet of Things and the Internet of Bodies .\nThe breakneck speed in which AI

workers , such as farming , retail , catering , manufacturing and the courier industries .\nHowever , automation in the form of robots , smart software and machine learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are routine ,

as accounting , HR and middle management positions .\nAlthough anticipating future employment trends is no easy task , it \u2019 s safe to say that the combined threat of pandemics and wars means the labour force is on the brink of an unprecedented reshuffle with technology reshaping logistics , potentially threatening hundreds of millions of blue and white collar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fastest displacement of jobs in history and foreshadowing a labour market shift which was previously inconceivable .\nWhile it has long been anticipated that the increased use of technology in the private sector would result in massive job losses , pandemic lockdowns and the coming disruption caused by a war will speed up this process , and many companies will be left with no other option but to lay off staff and replace them with creative technological solutions merely for the survival of their businesses .\nIn other words , many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ahead were already moving towards redundancy and are unlikely to be recovered once the dust is settled .\n3 .\nThe war has significantly reduced Europe \u2019 s reliance on the Russian energy sector and reinforced the centrality of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and \u2018 net zero \u2018 emissions which lies at the heart of the Great Reset .\nPolicymakers marching lockstep with the Great Reset have capitalised on the tough sanctions against Russia by accelerating the shift towards \u2018 green \u2019 energy and reiterating the importance of decarbonisation as part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 .\nHowever , it would be very short-sighted to assume that the Great Reset is ultimately geared towards the equitable distribution of \u2018 green \u2019 hydrogen and carbon-neutral synthetic fuels replacing petrol & diesel .\nWhile UN SDGs are crucial to post-pandemic recovery , more importantly , they are fundamental to the makeover of shareholder capitalism which is now being vaunted by the Davos elites as \u2018 stakeholder capitalism \u2019 .\nIn economic terms , this refers to a system where governments are no longer the final arbiters of state policies as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trustees of society , taking on the direct responsibility to address the world \u2019 s social , economic and environmental challenges through macroeconomic cooperation and a multi-stakeholder model of global governance .\nUnder such an economic construct , asset holding conglomerates can redirect the flow of global capital by aligning investments with the UN \u2019 s SDGs and configuring them as Environmental , Social , and Corporate Governance ( ESG ) compliant so that new international markets can be built on the disaster and misery of potentially hundreds of millions of people reeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nTherefore , the war offers a huge impetus for the governments pushing the reset to actively pursue energy independence , shape markets towards \u2018 green and inclusive growth \u2019 and eventually move populations towards a cap-and-trade system , otherwise known as a carbon credit economy .\nThis will centralise power in the hands of stakeholder capitalists under the benevolent guise of reinventing capitalism through fairer and greener means , using deceptive slogans like \u2018 Build Back Better \u2019 without sacrificing the perpetual growth imperative of capitalism .\n4 .\nFood shortages created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boon to the synthetic biology industry as the convergence of digital technologies with materials science and biology will radically transform the agricultural sector and encourage the adoption of plant-based and lab-grown alternatives on a global scale .\nRussia and Ukraine are both breadbaskets of the world and critical shortages in grains , fertilisers , vegetable oils and essential foodstuffs will catapult the importance of biotechnology to food security and sustainability and give birth to several imitation meat start-ups similar to \u2018 Impossible Foods \u2019 which was co-funded by Billy Boy .\nOne can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dramatic overhaul to industrial food production and cultivation , ultimately benefiting agribusiness and biotech investors , since food systems will be redesigned through emerging technologies to grow \u2018 sustainable \u2019 proteins and CRISPR gene-edited patented crops .\n5 .\nRussia \u2019 s exclusion from SWIFT ( The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication ) foreshadows an economic reset which will generate precisely the kind of blowback necessary for corralling large swathes of the global population into a technocratic control grid .\nAs several economists have opined , weaponizing SWIFT , CHIPS ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the US Dollar against Russia will only spur geopolitical rivals like China to accelerate the process of de-dollarisation .\nThe main benefactor of economic sanctions against Russia appears to be China which can reshape the Eurasian market by encouraging member states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ( SCO ) and BRICS to bypass the SWIFT ecosystem and settle cross-border international payments in the Digital Yuan .\nWhile the demand for cryptocurrencies will see a massive spike , this is likely to encourage many governments to increasingly regulate the sector through public blockchains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cryptocurrencies .\nThe shift to crypto could be the dress rehearsal to eventually expedite plans for programmable money overseen by a federal regulator , leading to the greater accretion of power in the hands of a powerful global technocracy and thus sealing our enslavement to financial institutions .\nI believe this war will bring currencies to parity , therefore heralding a new Bretton Woods moment which promises to transform the operation of international banking and macroeconomic cooperation through the future adoption of central bank digital currencies .\n6 .\nThis war marks a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a new international rules-based order anchored in Eurasia .\nAs the \u2018 father of geopolitics \u2019 Halford Mackinder opined over a century ago , the rise of every global hegemon in the past 500 years has been possible because of dominance over Eurasia .\nSimilarly , their decline has been associated with losing control over that pivotal landmass .\nThis causal connection between geography and power has not gone unnoticed by the global network of stakeholders representing the WEF , many of whom have anticipated the transition to a multipolar era and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s receding political and economic influence and a pressing need for what technocrats call smart globalisation .\nWhile America tries desperately to cling to its superpower status , China \u2019 s economic ascent and Russia \u2019 s regional ambitions threaten to upend the strategic axial points of Eurasia ( Western Europe and Asia Pacific ) .\nThe region in which America previously enjoyed uncontested hegemony is no longer impervious to cracks and we may be witnessing a changing of the guard which dramatically alters the calculus of global force projection .\nAlthough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Initiative ( BRI ) has the potential to unify the world-island ( Asia , Africa and Europe ) and cause a tectonic shift in the locus of global power , the recent invasion of Ukraine will have far-reaching consequences for China-Europe rail freight .\nThe Ukrainian President Zelensky claimed that Ukraine could function as the BRI \u2019 s gateway to Europe .\nTherefore , we can not ignore China \u2019 s huge stake in the recent tensions over Ukraine , nor can we ignore NATO \u2019 s underlying ambition to check China \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sale of Ukrainian assets to China and doing everything in its capacity to thwart The Modern Silk Road .\nAs sanctions push Russia towards consolidating bilateral ties with China and fully integrating with the BRI , a Pan-Eurasian trading bloc may be the realignment which forces a shared governance of the global commons and a reset to the age of US exceptionalism .\n7 .\nWith speculation mounting over the war \u2019 s long term impact on bilateral trade flows between China and Europe , the Russia-Ukraine conflict will catapult Israel \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 to even greater international prominence .\nIsrael is a highly attractive BRI market for China and the CCP is acutely aware of Israel \u2019 s importance as a strategic outpost connecting the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea through the Gulf of Suez .\nFurthermore , the Chinese government has for many years acknowledged the primacy of Israel as a global technology hub and capitalised on Israel \u2019 s innovation capabilities to help meet its own strategic challenges .\nTherefore , Naftali Bennet \u2019 s mediation between Moscow and Kiev is likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI ) in expanding both China and Israel \u2019 s regional and global strategic footprint .\nIsrael \u2019 s status as among the leading tech hubs of the future and gateway connecting Europe and the Middle East is inextricably tied to the web of physical infrastructures , such as roads , railways , ports and energy pipelines which China has been building over the past decade .\nAlready a powerhouse in auto-technologies , robotics and cybersecurity , Israel aspires to be the central nation in the millennial Kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are predicted to play a key role in the fourth industrial revolution .\nStrengthening its evolving relationship with China amid the Russia-Ukraine crisis could help propel Israel into a regional hegemon par excellence with a large share of centralised economic and technological power converging in Jerusalem .\nAs Israel embarks on efforts to diversify its export markets and investments away from the United States , it begs an important question .\nIs Israel in the formative stages of outsourcing its security interests away from the US and hedging its bets on the Sino-Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common knowledge that Digital IDs are a central plank in the World Economic Forum \u2019 s Great Reset agenda and are to be streamlined across industries , supply chains and markets as a way of advancing the UN 2030 SDGs and delivering individualised and integrated services in future smart cities .\nMany have cottoned on to how such a platform can be used to usher in a global system of technocratic population control and compliance by incorporating humanity into a new corporate value chain where citizens are mined as data commodities for ESG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assigned a social and climate score based on how well they measure up against the UN SDGs .\nThis seamless verification of people and connected devices in smart environments can only take place once our biometrics , health records , finances , education transcripts , consumer habits , carbon footprint and the entire sum of human experiences is stored on an interoperable database to determine our conformity with the UN SDGs , thus forcing a monumental change to our social contract .\nVaccine passports were initially touted by public-private partnerships as an entry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a logic has run its course , how might the present geopolitical tensions contribute to scaling what is the key node in a new digital ecosystem ?\nUkraine has traditionally been called Europe \u2019 s breadbasket and alongside Russia , both nations are major global suppliers of staple grains .\nTherefore , the war has all the makings of a black swan for commodities and inflation .\nWith an economy teetering on the brink of collapse due to a global supply crunch , I believe the resulting economic tremors will trigger wartime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be told to brace themselves for rationing .\nOnce this takes place , the multilateral adoption of Digital IDs which interface with Central Bank Digital Currencies can be touted as the solution to efficiently manage and distribute household rations under an unprecedented state of emergency and exception .\nThe Bank of England has already floated the prospect of programmable cash which can only be spent on essentials or goods which an employer or government deem sensible .\nOnce the issuer is granted control over how it is spent by the recipient , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequately without a Digital ID , which will be required to receive food parcels and obtain a basic means of subsistence .\nThink UBI ( Universal Basic Income ) .\nIf food inflation continues on an upward trajectory with no signs of abating , governments may institute price controls in the form of rationing and ration entries could be logged on blockchain ledgers on the Digital ID to track our carbon footprint and consumptive habits during a national emergency .\n9 .\nEurope is directly in the line of fire once a hybrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is underway .\nIt would be remiss to ignore the clear and present danger posed by a cyber attack on banks and critical infrastructure or even a tentative and tactical nuclear exchange with intercontinental ballistic missiles ( ICBMs ) .\nWarning !\nThe World Economic Forum Ran a Financial Cyberattack Simulation That Led to a Great Reset of the Global Economy .\nI can \u2019 t see how any warring party will not be limited by the doctrine of mutually assured destruction so a thermonuclear fallout is unlikely .\nHowever , the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory from the SWIFT banking apparatus or Cross-Border Interbank Payment System can potentially render much of the international economy non-operational and send the dollar into a tailspin .\nIf an event of such cataclysmic proportions was to occur , it will undoubtedly lead to increasing demands to overhaul cyber security .\nThe fallout from such an event could very well establish a new global security protocol according to which citizens must possess a Digital ID as a necessary national security measure .\nOne can imagine how accessing the internet or public services in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require citizens to use a Digital ID to authenticate that their online activities and transactions are from a legitimate and non-malicious source .\nThere are few coincidences in politics .\n10 .\nThe economic implications of this war will be so disastrous that governments and the public sector will require a significant injection of private capital to address the financing shortfall .\nThis will effectively render the traditional separation of powers between central banking institutions and governments obsolete , as the former will be positioned to disproportionately influence the fiscal trajectory of nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out by the wholesale capture of governments by the central banks and hedge funds .\nTherefore , the nation-state model is gradually being upended by a global technocracy , consisting of an unelected consortium of leaders of industry , central banking oligarchs and private financial institutions , most of which are predominantly non-state corporate actors attempting to restructure global governance and enlist themselves in the global decision-making process .\nTherefore , the future of international relations and the social , economic and political transformation which the world is presently undergoing in light of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be decided through multilateralism and elected representatives of sovereign states .\nRather , it will be decided through a network of multi-stakeholder partnerships which are motivated by the politics of expediency and not accountable to any electorate or beholden to any state and for whom concepts like sovereignty and international law are meaningless .", "author": "HAF", "url": "https://humansbefree.com/2022/03/10-signs-the-war-in-ukraine-is-part-of-the-great-reset.html", "published": "Mon, 14 Mar

on the dominant role that carbon dioxide is said to play in the global atmospheric temperature .\nAccording to the climate site No Tricks Zone , the list has grown significantly from 50 in 2016 .\nMuch of the ongoing science debate , ignored by almost all media , concerns equilibrium climate sensitivity ( ECS ) \u2013 the increase in the global temperature that will follow a doubling of atmospheric CO2 .\nWhen green activists talk of \u2018 settled \u2019 science , they refer to their certainty that humans drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the climate .\nBut this political certitude is far from settled among scientists , notably those who study physics and chemistry .\nNobody actually knows what the ECS figure is , so estimates are made all the way up to 6\u00b0C .\nThese are then used in climate models , which have spent the last 40 years producing inaccurate forecasts .\nIn addition , a worst case prediction or \u2018 pathway \u2019 called RCP8.5 assumes that temperatures will rise by 5\u00b0C in less than 80 years .\nThis \u2018 pathway \u2019 was quoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the recent doomsday IPCC report .\nNo Tricks Zone highlighted a recent paper from the German physics Professor Dieter Schildknecht from Bielefeld University .\nThis work suggested that a further atmospheric increase of CO beyond 300 parts per million ( it currently stands at around 418 ppm ) \u201c can not lead to an appreciably stronger absorption of radiation , and consequently can not affect the Earth \u2019 s climate \u201d .\nThis finding is one of many that suggest the ability of CO to radiate heat back to the Earth \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point .\nProfessor Schildknecht finds that doubling CO leads to 0.5\u00b0C warming as \u201d absorption reaches close to 100 % \u201d .\nHe concludes that the effect of an anthropogenic CO increase on the Earth \u2019 s climate is \u201c fairly negligible \u201d .\nSome of the work on the warming properties of CO and other greenhouse gases such as water vapour , methane and ozone uses the HITRAN database , which helps detailed study of the infrared spectrum .\nIt can be seen that CO traps heat , but only within certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led many scientists , notably Professor William Happer of Princeton University ( pictured ) , to suggest that CO becomes \u201c saturated \u201d once it reaches a certain level .\nMost , if not all , the heat that is going to be trapped will have already been radiated back by the CO molecules evenly distributed in the existing atmosphere .\nThe atomic physicist Dr. Boris Smirnov is another scientist who has conducted work on the radiative abilities of greenhouse gases .\nIn 2018 , he published a paper that suggested doubling CO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0.4\u00b0C in global temperature .\nThe human contribution from burning fossil fuel is put at a \u201c negligible \u201d 0.02\u00b0C .\nAt the heart of the Net Zero agenda is an assumption that burning fossil fuel is responsible for all or most of the recent rise of atmospheric CO .\nHowever , humans contribute barely 4 % of the gas that enters the atmosphere every year .\nThree physics professors led by Kenneth Skrable from the University of Massachusetts recently examined the three isotopes of carbon found in the atmosphere .\nThe carbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly higher proportion of carbon isotope 12C and marginally alters the balance of the other two .\nBy examining the isotope trail , the scientists found that human-released CO between 1750 and 2018 \u201c was much too low to be the cause of global warming \u201d .\nNew Research Finds Human Activity Has Virtually ZERO Negative Impact On Global Temperatures .\nThe direct link between rising , or falling , CO2 and temperature has never been conclusively proved .\nIn the historical and geological past , few links have been shown .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5.2 % in the atmosphere from 1900 to 1940 , before global industrialisation took off .\nFrom 1940 to 1980 , the global temperature fell , but CO2 rose 8.9 % .\nFor almost two decades , recent warming has run out of steam and the temperature hasn \u2019 t moved for the last seven years and four months .\nThis despite CO2 continuing to rise .\nPhysics Professor Peter Stallinga from the University of the Algarve states that the correlation between CO and temperature is \u201c readily explained \u201d by the outgassing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly plausible in explaining the recent rise in atmospheric CO .\nThe oceans hold vast reserves of CO and any natural warming is likely to release some of this into the atmosphere .\nSome ice core evidence also suggests that CO rises in the atmosphere after the temperature increases .\nThe climate change business has largely been captured by \u2018 post-normal \u2019 scientists , as the Daily Sceptic showed last Monday .\nThis occurs when high cost decisions are at stake , but there is considerable uncertainty over the relevant scientific facts .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and economic \u2013 are sought from an extended peer base .\nTraditionally , scientists have looked to falsify an hypothesis by empirical data .\nUnder this rigour , it is not possible yet to prove humans caused all or most climate change ( let alone single weather events , as is sometimes claimed ) .\nTop Scientist Resigns : \u2018 Global Warming is a $ Trillions Scam \u2014 It Has Corrupted Many Scientists.\n\u2019 Net Zero relies on the \u2018 settled \u2019 science lie , a lie that after three decades of constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command-and-control Net Zero political agenda needs science debate to be stifled , and therein lies the current danger of a suggested referendum on the matter .\nWriting in the Daily Telegraph on Tuesday , Madeline Grant called Net Zero a \u201c fantasy \u201d and a \u201d worthy ambition \u201d in the course of the same paragraph .\nNet Zero is an impractical fantasy , and is likely to collapse of its own accord , with or without the immediate help of the

collection .\nThe reaction she received was that having graphic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both acceptable and advantageous for pupils .\nShe inquired , \u201c Why is there child pornography in NY School Libraries ?\n\u201d She included explicit photographs from the book when she sent the enquiry .\nAccording to the DOE , the book \u201c neither depicts or describes pedophilia , child rape , or desensitizes to predators \u201d based on such photos .\nGender Queer : A Memoir , by Maia Kobabe , is a coming-of-age novel about a girl who grows up with hippie parents , discovers herself at odds with the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and fantasizes about having a penis .\nThe novel even mentions discovering materials at the library that inspired the protagonist to explore her gender identity .\n\u201c Why is this graphic pornographic and grooming text in the NY school libraries ?\n\u201d the New York City mom asks .\n\u201c Our family has been harmed by gender ideology and pornography in schools , leading to three hospitalizations and a suicide attempt .\nTransition was not therapeutic and yet everywhere we turn , there is more propaganda pushing our children towards transition .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why is

having a penis , describes porn preferences with friends , keeps complaining that nobody ever comprehends being asexual , and is horribly traumatized and frightened of gynecological consultations , a theme that recurs throughout the novel .\nRather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own skin , the main character fights against herself at each and every opportunity .\nThe book contains images of blow jobs , as

the apparent lack of a healthy comprehension of intimate relationships , decides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pointless hook-up merely to learn what kissing is like so she can include it in One Direction fan fiction .\nOn page 157 , the main character realizes that erotic desires are driven by a \u201c kink \u201d : \u201c autoandrophilia , \u201d or being excited by the concept of having male genitals

examination of porn and random hook-up mentality .\nThe incorporation of the book is justified by the New York City Department of Education , which claims that \u201c other readers can gain empathy and understanding for peers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to note , \u201d they write , \u201c Gender Queer is a memoir and one person \u2019 s experience with their own identity.\n\u201d The novel includes graphic

making \u201c eir \u201d own decisions rather than a gullible adolescent .\nThe main character dismisses worries that merely being female in civilization is problematic , and declares that a \u201c third option \u201d has always been desired .\nThe accessories and practicalities of being female seem to have been clearly overwhelming earlier in the book , but by page 197 , the sensation of becoming a \u201c third gender \u201d is abruptly something that had been \u201c always wanted.\n\u201d It \u2019 s as if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recreating their own history in real time and then rejecting that they are doing it .\nThe NYCDOE \u2019 s Materials Evaluation Committee determined that all these items ought to be available in school libraries .\nThey defend their choice by claiming that the book has won numerous honors , without mentioning that these honors are given by groups dedicated to advancing minors \u2019 gender transition , including Stonewall , or by far-left activists , like the American Library Association .\nThe Materials Evaluation Committee ( read below ) advises school librarians to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criteria match the curriculum , age level of your students and the religious and cultural atmosphere of your community \u201d in guidelines for school librarians .\nThe book is recommended for 14-year-olds and up .\nThe main character is using a binder by page 211 to minimize \u201c eir \u201d breasts and look less characteristically female .\nBy page 213 , the protagonist is fantasizing about a double mastectomy .\nBy the page 233 , the protagonist is educating middle school kids and planning to come out to them .\nThe DOE claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d in the school library , despite the fact that \u201c affirmation \u201d is not the only or even the most effective way .\nThe New York mom contacted Chancellor of Schools David Banks upon receiving confirmation from the DOE that such a book will indeed be accessible to children in public school libraries .\nShe stated : \u201c I reported this book for inappropriate sexual and gender grooming content .\nYou can see my complaints attached and the city \u2019 s response .\nThe reviewing committee felt that this title , Gender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nDo you agree ?\nHere is an excerpt , \u201d she writes , including images of the lesbian strap-on blowjob and nude gay sex fantasies .\n\u201c This is not

in the name of the noblest causes.\n\u201d \u2014 Thomas Paine The government wants your money .\nIt will beg , steal or borrow if necessary , but it wants your money any way it can get it .\nThe government \u2019 s schemes to swindle , cheat , scam , and generally defraud taxpayers of their hard-earned dollars have run the gamut from wasteful pork barrel legislation , cronyism and graft to asset forfeiture , costly stimulus packages , and a national security complex that continues to undermine our freedoms while failing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have also been made to pay through the nose for the government \u2019 s endless wars , subsidization of foreign nations , military empire , welfare state , roads to nowhere , bloated workforce , secret agencies , fusion centers , private prisons , biometric databases , invasive technologies , arsenal of weapons , and every other budgetary line item that is contributing to the fast-growing wealth of the corporate elite at the expense of those who are barely making ends meet \u2014 that is , we the taxpayers .\nThis is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills : someone \u2019 s got to foot the bill .\nBecause the government \u2019 s voracious appetite for money , power and control has grown out of control , its agents have devised other means of funding its excesses and adding to its largesse through taxes disguised as fines , taxes disguised as fees , and taxes disguised as tolls , tickets and penalties .\nNo matter how much money the government pulls in , it \u2019 s never enough , so the government has come up with a new plan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seize Americans \u2019 bank accounts .\nMake way for the digital dollar .\nIn an Executive Order issued on March 9 , 2022 , President Biden called for the federal government to consider establishing a \u201c U.S .\nCentral Bank Digital Currency ( CBDC ) .\n\u201d Similar to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin , CBDCs would also be a form of digital money , but there the resemblance ends .\nIf adopted , CBDCs would be issued by the Federal Reserve , the central banking system for the U.S. government .\nOne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a physical dollar .\nAnd like the physical dollar , which ceased to be backed by gold more than 50 years ago , the CBDC would be considered a government-issued fiat currency that is backed by the strength and credit of the U.S. government .\n( Of course , that \u2019 s not saying much considering that much of the time , the U.S. government operates in the red . )\nAlthough government agencies have six months to weigh in on the advantages and disadvantages of a centralized digital currency , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal .\nFor instance , three weeks before the Biden Administration made headlines with its support for a government-issued digital currency , the FBI and the Justice Department quietly moved ahead with plans for a cryptocurrency enforcement team ( translation : digital money cops ) , a virtual asset exploitation unit tasked with investigating crypto crimes and seizing virtual assets , and a crypto czar to oversee it all .\nNo surprises here , of course .\nThis is how the government operates : by giving us tools to make our lives \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making it easier for the government to track , control and punish the citizenry .\nIndeed , this shift to a digital currency is a global trend .\nMore than 100 other countries are considering introducing their own digital currencies .\nChina has already adopted a government-issued digital currency , which not only allows it to surveil and seize people \u2019 s financial transactions , but can also work in tandem with its social credit score system to punish individuals for moral lapses and social transgressions ( and reward them for adhering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expert Akram Keram wrote for The Washington Post , \u201c With digital yuan , the CCP [ Chinese Communist Party ] will have direct control over and access to the financial lives of individuals , without the need to strong-arm intermediary financial entities .\nIn a digital-yuan-consumed society , the government easily could suspend the digital wallets of dissidents and human rights activists.\n\u201d Where China goes , the United States eventually follows .\nInevitably , a digital currency will become part of our economy and a central part of the government \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ESG ( Environmental , Social and Governance ) initiatives that are tantamount to social media credit scores for corporations , and you will find that we \u2019 re traveling the same road as China towards digital authoritarianism .\nAs journalist Jon Brookin warns : \u201c Digital currency issued by a central bank can be used as a tool for government surveillance of citizens and control over their financial transactions.\n\u201d As such , digital currency provides the government and its corporate partners with a mode of commerce that can easily be monitored , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hacked , hijacked and confiscated when convenient .\nThis push for a digital currency dovetails with the government \u2019 s war on cash , which it has been subtly waging for some time now .\nMuch like the war on drugs and the war on terror , this so-called \u201c war on cash \u201d has been sold to the public as a means of fighting terrorists , drug dealers , tax evaders and more recently , COVID-19 germs .\nIn recent years , just the mere possession of significant amounts of cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ label you a criminal .\nThe rationale ( by police ) is that cash is the currency for illegal transactions given that it \u2019 s harder to track , can be used to pay illegal immigrants , and denies the government its share of the \u201c take , \u201d so doing away with paper money will help law enforcement fight crime and help the government realize more revenue .\nAccording to economist Steve Forbes , \u201c The real reason for this war on cash \u2014 start with the big bills and then work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power grab by Big Government .\nPeople will have less privacy : Electronic commerce makes it easier for Big Brother to see what we \u2019 re doing , thereby making it simpler to bar activities it doesn \u2019 t like , such as purchasing salt , sugar , big bottles of soda and Big Macs.\n\u201d This is how a cashless society \u2014 easily monitored , controlled , manipulated , weaponized and locked down \u2014 plays right into the hands of the government ( and its corporate partners ) .\nDespite what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of corruption , bumbling , fumbling and data breaches , not to mention how easily technology can be used against us , the shift to a cashless society is really not a hard sell for a society increasingly dependent on technology for the most mundane aspects of life .\nIn much the same way that Americans have opted into government surveillance through the convenience of GPS devices and cell phones , digital cash \u2014 the means of paying with one \u2019 s debit card , credit card or cell phone \u2014 is becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police state .\nNot too long ago , it was estimated that smart phones would replace cash and credit cards altogether by 2020 .\nRight on schedule , growing numbers of businesses have adopted no-cash policies , including certain airlines , hotels , rental car companies , restaurants and retail stores .\nIn Sweden , even the homeless and churches accept digital cash .\nMaking the case for a digital wallet , journalist Lisa Rabasca Roepe argues that there \u2019 s no longer a need for cash .\n\u201c More and more retailers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Google Wallet , Samsung Pay , and Android Pay , \u201d notes Roepe .\n\u201c PayPal \u2019 s app is now accepted at many chain stores including Barnes & Noble , Foot Locker , Home Depot , and Office Depot .\nWalmart and CVS have both developed their own payment apps while their competitors Target and RiteAid are working on their own apps.\n\u201d So what \u2019 s really going on here ?\nDespite all of the advantages that go along with living in a digital age \u2014 namely , convenience \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cashless world navigated by way of a digital wallet doesn \u2019 t signal the beginning of the end for what little privacy we have left and leave us vulnerable to the likes of government thieves , data hackers and an all-knowing , all-seeing Orwellian corpo-governmental state .\nFirst , when I say privacy , I \u2019 m not just referring to the things that you don \u2019 t want people to know about , those little things you do behind closed doors that are neither illegal nor harmful but embarrassing or intimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that are deeply personal and which no one need know about , certainly not the government and its constabulary of busybodies , nannies , Peeping Toms , jail wardens and petty bureaucrats .\nSecond , we \u2019 re already witnessing how easy it will be for government agents to manipulate digital wallets for their own gain in order to track your movements , monitor your activities and communications , and ultimately shut you down .\nFor example , civil asset forfeiture schemes are becoming even more profitable for police agencies thanks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Data ) devices supplied by the Department of Homeland Security that allow police to not only determine the balance of any magnetic-stripe card ( i.e.\n, debit , credit and gift cards ) but also freeze and seize any funds on pre-paid money cards .\nIn fact , the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that it does not violate the Fourth Amendment for police to scan or swipe your credit card .\nExpect those numbers to skyrocket once digital money cops show up in full force .\nThird , a government-issued digital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of the economy and complete access to the citizenry \u2019 s pocketbook .\nWhile the government might tout the ease with which it can deposit stimulus funds into the citizenry \u2019 s accounts , such a system could also introduce what economists refer to as \u201c negative interest rates.\n\u201d Instead of being limited by a zero bound threshold on interest rates , the government could impose negative rates on digital accounts in order to control economic growth .\n\u201c If the cash is electronic , the government can just erase 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d said David Yermack , a finance professor at New York University .\nFourth , a digital currency will open Americans \u2014 and their bank accounts \u2014 up to even greater financial vulnerabilities from hackers and government agents alike .\nFifth , digital authoritarianism will redefine what it means to be free in almost every aspect of our lives .\nAgain , we must look to China to understand what awaits us .\nAs Human Rights Watch analyst Maya Wang explains : \u201c Chinese authorities use technology to control the population all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways .\nThe central bank is adopting digital currency , which will allow Beijing to surveil \u2014 and control \u2014 people \u2019 s financial transactions .\nChina is building so-called safe cities , which integrate data from intrusive surveillance systems to predict and prevent everything from fires to natural disasters and political dissent .\nThe government believes that these intrusions , together with administrative actions , such as denying blacklisted people access to services , will nudge people toward \u2018 positive behaviors , \u2019 including greater compliance with government policies and healthy habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a pre-technological , Luddite age , there \u2019 s really no way to pull this horse back now that it \u2019 s left the gate .\nTo our detriment , we have virtually no control over who accesses our private information , how it is stored , or how it is used .\nAnd in terms of our bargaining power over digital privacy rights , we have been reduced to a pitiful , unenviable position in which we can only hope and trust that those in power will treat our information with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any kind of digital currency is adopted , we need stricter laws on data privacy and an Electronic Bill of Rights that protects \u201c we the people \u201d from predatory surveillance and data-mining business practices by the government and its corporate partners .\nAs I make clear in my book Battlefield America : The War on the American People and in its fictional

just what are they ?\nSome smart acres say , \u201c well , if I heard of them then they ain \u2019 t so secret are they ?\n\u201d Well , I say just because you have heard of them does not mean you know neither all of their secrets nor exactly what they are really all about .\nThen on the other hand , there just may be some that we have not even heard of and that makes them very secret societies .\nFine Dictionary puts it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society that conceals its activities from nonmembers \u201d while Wikipedia adds a bit more to that , \u201c A secret society is a club or an organization whose activities , events , inner functioning , or membership are concealed .\nThe society may or may not attempt to conceal its existence .\nThe term usually excludes covert groups , such as intelligence agencies or guerrilla warfare insurgencies , that hide their activities and memberships but maintain a public presence \u201d which better explains why the guy in the first instance is incorrect .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ societies in coming instalments while this first column is an overview of them in general .\nWhile we are on the subject of what a secret society is , let us also look at what it is not as the second description covers and add a bit to that .\nGroups like BLM and Antifa do not qualify as a secret society but act like them and do count as covert warfare or insurgency agents while the World Economic Forum and the Council of Foreign Affairs may not be either although they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ societies and perhaps they include operatives that are secret enforcement or activation groups ( like BLM and Antifa ) that may also be secret societies .\nAgain , let \u2019 s look at what Wikipedia says to help clarify that a bit : \u201c The exact qualifications for labeling a group a secret society are disputed , but definitions generally rely on the degree to which the organization insists on secrecy , and might involve the retention and transmission of secret knowledge , the denial of membership or knowledge of the group , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the organization , and the use of secret rites or rituals which solidify members of the group.\n\u201d There seems to be an abundance of them on college campuses and in business dealings and political systems .\nOne must look at the difference between what faith in Christian religion exemplifies and what faith in the \u2018 rational \u2019 mind of Man is .\nFaith in our Creator is natural ; it is good because there is a higher order that overcomes the weaknesses in man , while the basic idea behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea that man is in and of himself the god ( s ) .\nPresident John F Kennedy gave the following speech on Secret Societies : One results in the higher or nobler laws that are immutable , everlasting and supreme while the other is determined by the vagaries and impersonal and deviant desires of very fallible men .\nPlease note that the execution of those higher laws and ideals are not well followed , while the execution of the grosser \u2018 man is supreme \u2019 ideas are always fatally realized .\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also many groups that disguise or hide inside of or are extensions to religious systems as well and that is why the pure Christian ideal is rarely if not at any time realized , although the teachings of the basic Hebrew Ten Commandments and the much greater Sermon on the Mount are the foundation of rational as well as spiritual life for those that would live happily and fruitfully .\n\u201c Rational \u201d is a term that Miriam-Webster \u2019 s more applicable definition is that \u201c having reason or understanding\u2026 relating to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason \u201d and \u201c Reason \u201d is \u201c a statement offered in explanation or justification\u2026 the thing that makes some fact intelligible\u2026 the power of comprehending , inferring , or thinking especially in orderly rational ways\u2026 treatment that affords satisfaction \u201d and it is agreeable to reason that what makes life easier to contend with and allows people to be safely sociable and more anxious for peace , justifies a life well lived and creates satisfaction with not only oneself but those you love and is made eternally binding and non mutable is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , the idea of the Gnostics that there is a greater understanding of the world derived from mans own logic or rational thought than that given by the Creator of that same world .\nThey rely on their own devises and ideas as to what the world is , how it is run , how to use or manipulate and control it and therefore that God who created it is of no importance .\nYes , I understand that is not what is taught in our universities about it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own studies .\nEvil is the satanic revolt against divine authority , and therefore the rejection of that divine wisdom and substituting and implementing you own theories is the very basis of such evils as the Marxist theories , \u201c woke \u201d culture , hedonistic destructions , our modern New World Order and the evil force behind the \u201c Great Reset \u201d and the basis of what those Secret Societies are comprised of .\nBibleTools.org says it this way , \u201c Gnosticism is difficult to define because it comes in so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not a separate denomination or religion but a religious philosophy .\nIt is a framework from which to explain the nature of God , creation , good and evil , man , and the purpose of life\u2026 ; The Gnostics spoke extensively about a species of non-physical entities called \u2018 archons \u2019 , who can posses human bodies and manipulate them to their personal gain .\nIn the Bible , we know them as devils ; those who are well-versed in the ET intervention on Earth understand them as non-physical aliens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archons HERE .\nThe Gnostic concepts are typically traced back to the religions of Persia and India ( Zoroastrianism and Hinduism ) , but they have been added to and modified over time , especially as they became entrenched in Greek culture .\nAs Plato \u2019 s writings are full of Gnostic concepts , he furthered the cause of the Gnostics tremendously .\nToday , Jewish mystics practice a religion known as Kabbalah , a Gnostic version of Judaism\u2026 \u201d and in Genesis 3:1 speaks of \u201c Satan sows seeds of doubt as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Satan \u2019 s very first words were , \u201c Has God indeed said\u2026 ?\n\u201d Spoken or not , this sentiment that God is untrustworthy , and that His Word is suspect , has been a regular feature in mankind \u2019 s relationship with God ever since .\nThe Gnostics were no exception \u2014 in fact , they are a prime example.\n\u201d Gnostics trust their own selves and do not trust in God and that is what makes them anti-God and never to be trusted .\nThis concept is the very basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and weak of faith and of mind .\nOur second video covers some of the ways that secret societies prove you do not love God and that you are in the bitterness of evil if you reject this warning .\n\u201c A core issue of the Bible is whether we submit to God \u2019 s governance or try to form a government based on our own perception of what is good or what works .\nGod \u2019 s way results in eternal life , but it comes with the obligation to submit ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of His commandments and overcoming our human weaknesses that do not rise to that standard .\nSatan , conversely , seeks to persuade us to do our own thing and to usurp God \u2019 s prerogative in defining right living .\nHe encourages us to be enlightened , to have our eyes opened , by doubting God and rejecting His way.\n\u201d Cain can be seen as the creator of the first secret society in that he hid his crime of murder for the sake of taking his brothers goods because he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not him .\nWhy is explained in the Bible in Hebrews 11:4 \u201c By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain , by which he obtained witness that he was righteous , God testifying of his gifts : and by it he being dead yet speaketh \u201d , but if God had respect for Abel \u2019 s sacrifice and not Cain \u2019 s we can logically assume that Cain did not sacrifice in the manner given of God or not in the right state of heart and mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cain sacrificed for his own gain and not for obeying Gods words .\nWhen looking at the story of Lamech it appears there may have been some kept secret oath of silence by his wives about the murder of that young man and therefore some sort of conspiracy involved .\nI have wondered if that same idea applies to Cain and his situation as the sentence pronounced by the Lord if anyone came after them to kill them means that their stories were more similar than mentioned .\nOther readings translated from other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea that this may be so , which means that the very first secret societies were created by man to hide the evil act of cold blooded murder for gain , and that is also a fitting definition of what many secret societies are made for .\nMany are just that and history is full of them .\nThe result is that the secret society is one of the very oldest constructs created by man ( or Satan ! )\nand predates most written history even back as far as just after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eden .\nAnd they have never been organized for the betterment of Gods children but for the gain of those involved alone .\nThe Catholic church said of secret societies that the \u201c judgment of the Church on secret oath-bound associations has been made abundantly clear by papal documents .\nFreemasonry was condemned by Clement XII in a Constitution , dated 28 April , 1738 .\nThe pope insists on the objectionable character of societies that commit men of all or no religion to a system of mere natural righteousness , that seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret pacts by strict oaths , often under penalties of the severest character , and that plot against the tranquility of the State \u201d .\nThis particular document also goes specifically over the Catholic leaders ideas on the Masons and some other secret societies .\nThe Lutheran church said \u201c The Synod observes with sorrow that many Christians in this country have gotten mixed up in secret societies such as the Odd Fellows , Freemason lodges , etc.\n, and are still mixed up in them .\nThe Word of God is clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as \u201c Matthew 5:33-37 forbids us to swear by any creature of God or any thing in general \u201d and that \u201c Matthew 6:25-34. is transgressed by someone who joins these secret societies .\nFor by not avoiding their company for the sake of receiving physical support , he declares that he does not turn to his God and provider in times of need and death , but to human fellowship and Mammon \u201d .\nFor reference , go back to my explanation of why Gnosticism is not of God and that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our Creator .\nThat seems very clear , and there are far more religions that forbid belonging to any secret society than a book sized article could contain .\nAnd not just in Christianity alone but in many religions all over the world .\nThe fact remains that secret societies and many brotherhoods can be described as churches in their own right and are against God \u2019 s commandments to be a part of .\nWhat is worse is what they do to the Children of God and the world in general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sect of such or a secret society ?\nA cult is a \u201c a system of religious beliefs and ritual \u201d while a sect is a \u201c a religious denomination\u2026 a religious denomination\u2026 regarded as extreme or heretical \u201d ( definitions from Merriam-Webster ) and there can be some very vague separations although generically we can say that a cult is a sect , a separate organ and usually a version or \u2018 dialect \u2019 of some religion while a secret society is a very secret or selectively secret club .\nPlease do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one religion does not meet you own specific ideals does not make them automatically a cult , they just have different beliefs than you .\nAlso , ones cult is another \u2019 s religion , and ones religion may be another \u2019 s secret society so we need to use good judgment in determining what is what and even that can often be incorrect .\nBut as we shall see , secret societies are often based on and sometimes constitute or institute a religion of their own much the same as a cult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although the primary difference seems to be that the cult is primarily religious in nature while the secret society is primarily political or ( and ) criminal in nature ( which suggests political parties are related to both cults and secret societies ) .\nAnd because secret societies originated in religion and operate under many versions of governance and have so many aspects of a religion ( or more accurately , cults ) the lines can become very blurry .\nTo be sure , there are religions that are thought of as cults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with secret societies .\nCults and secret societies can have distinct specific and even intoned beliefs , rituals , dress , and even language determined by their own intrinsic utilization of their own terms .\nYes , they have a lot in common .\nPerhaps one of the major differences is in the fact that religions and sects have what is seemingly secret things but are better classified as sacred , not secret .\nSacred means Holy ; one does not \u2018 toss ones pearls before swine \u2019 as the Bible says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor profane the holy and sanctified by public or off handed references to holy matters .\nSecrets are those things that are forbidden because of the harm it can bring to those making those things secret , like the slaughter of the \u2018 young man to Lamech \u2019 s hurt \u2019 .\nThe Eucharist and baptism of the Catholic and other churches is holy , the Passover meal and coming of age rights in the Jewish traditions ( and the ancient temple rites ) , the installation of a priest in the Buddhist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacred and are not to be profaned by common discussion .\nBut the secrets in many cults or societies or brotherhoods and the like are punishable by death of not just yourself but many times of your entire family as seen on various organized criminal gangs and \u2018 mafias \u2019 .\nConcealed or secret is not the same thing as sacred .\nThis distinction is very apparent in the study of the great secret societies that we will be looking at soon .\nThey play a huge role is what we are witnessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our history and that of many other cultures , and we will look more particularity at those that affect us the most because our very existence may be at stake with the recent developments cause by those secret societies and their correlation with prophecy .", "author": "HAF", "url":

attribute which can best be described as \u201c living.\n\u201d The ancient Hebrew language contains many such words ending in the \u2018 im suffix .\nNotable among these is \u201c Elohim , \u201d a plural group of living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c gods.\n\u201d The well-known \u201c Nephilim \u201d are another such example .\nDozens of further examples exist and are the topic of a separate study by this author .\nCherubim are commonly believed to be angels who act as powerful guards or attendants to the divine throne .\nThe Bible supports this view to a point .\nIn Genesis 3:24 , God places cherubim and a flaming sword at the Garden of Eden to guard the way of the tree of life .\nElsewhere , numerous instances occur where the cherubim are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d In the Tabernacle , and later in the temple , gold cherubim on the mercy seat not only signified the presence of God , but also seemed to act in some sort of protective capacity ( Exodus 37:7-9 ; Numbers 7:89 ; Psalm 80:1 ) .\nHowever , this model of the cherubim as Yahweh \u2019 s guardian angels falls a bit short when one considers the description and other activities ascribed to the cherubim throughout the scriptures .\nChariot , Flying Vehicle , or Top Gun : Different Interpretations of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bible , Yahweh is said to \u201c ride upon \u201d the cherubim .\nIn many of these references , the cherubim are described as some kind of flying vehicle , often compared to a chariot .\nThis concept was so influential in second century BC Judaism that an entire sect of Kabbalah mysticism formed around this so-called chariot that they called the Merkabah .\nKing David , the author of the Psalms , describes \u201c thousands upon thousands \u201d of these flying cherubim and how they were instrumentally involved in several of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to indicate that certain tactics were pre-arranged ahead of time between himself and the cherubim in order to ambush the enemy .\nSome hints of this can be glimpsed in Psalm 18 , Psalm 33 , Psalm 68 , and Psalm 102 .\nThis is also the origin of the phrases \u201c the heavenly hosts \u201d and \u201c the Lord of hosts.\n\u201d The prophet Ezekiel put a slightly different twist on this concept , however .\nIn Ezekiel \u2019 s vision ( sometimes interpreted to be a UFO encounter ) , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , but as \u201c living beings \u201d that somehow controlled Yahweh \u2019 s craft .\nThere is an intriguing link in the stories of Ezekiel and Isaiah which seem to equate the cherubim with another fascinating \u2018 im word , the seraphim .\nThe seraphim are understood to be snake-like in some regard , perhaps reptilian , but also represented as possessing the power of flight .\nThe parallels to global mythological components here are abundant , from the Greek god Triptolemus to the plumed serpents of Mesoamerican lore and dragons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write of their encounters with the Cherubim , describing them as having multiple surfaces .\nTypically , these descriptions are translated as monstrous descriptions of creatures with many wings and with four faces : \u201c each creature had the face of a man , the face of a lion , the face of an ox and the face of an eagle.\n\u201d It is an intriguing fact that the mythologies of several other cultures combine these same animals into their own versions of what might be the same phenomena .\nThe roughly contemporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lamassu , with body parts taken from a bull , a lion , an eagle , and a man .\nLikewise , the Talmudic and deuterocanonical \u201c Asmodeus \u201d appears to have the same four faces in some depictions .\nSuch depictions are thought to predate the many chimeric mythological creatures of a wide range of cultures , such as the sphinx of Egyptian and Asian fame , as well as the numerous Greek examples , and may have been an inspiration or influence on these later traditions .\nWhether through intelligent design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrestrial life appears to follow a handful of simple heuristics ; one of the most prevalent of which is bilateral symmetry .\nBilateral symmetry provides matching sets of many elements of gross anatomy , from pairs of arms and hands , to pairs of eyes and ears .\nIt is the reason that mirrors are effective in providing a reasonably accurate representation of reality .\nThis is where one may begin to notice a problem with the classic interpretation of the multifaceted cherubim .\nThey are apparently the only animal in the known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symmetry .\nThus , it is my opinion that the interpretation of the four faces suffers from translation problems .\nAnimals just don \u2019 t have four faces .\nThe fact is that the text of the original Hebrew Bible is decidedly less clear regarding certain key words in these relevant passages .\nI do not think they were describing faces at all .\nPerhaps the other animals indicated are meant to provide some type of hint toward various attributes of the cherubim .\nIn any case , the text contains enough ambiguity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumptions on this translation .\nThe prophet Ezekiel opens up a rather intriguing tangential topic in his 28th chapter .\nThis chapter is written as a message to be delivered from Yahweh , through Ezekiel , to someone called the \u201c Prince of Tyre.\n\u201d As a strange twist , Ezekiel specifically mentions the cherubim who was standing guard at Eden in Genesis 3 .\nHe actually equates this singular cherubim ( sic ) with the \u201c Prince of Tyre.\n\u201d But how can this be ?\nThis prince is the recipient and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , obviously indicating that said prince must have been contemporary to the prophet ( circa 600 BC ) , and therefore capable of receiving a message from him .\nYet , Ezekiel claims that this same person was present at the Garden of Eden , as part of a narrative that took place at a minimum of several thousand years prior to Ezekiel \u2019 s lifetime .\nThis would seem to indicate that at the time of Ezekiel , this particular cherubim was thousands of years old , yet still alive , residing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tyre , in Lebanon .\nThis fact may also indicate some level of support for the idea sometimes known as the \u201c 70 sons of El , \u201d as presented in the Ugaritic texts .\nThe crux of this theory is that the Earth is divided into several ( ostensibly , seventy ) territories , each ruled by a different regional god , one of whom is the god of Israel , namely Yahweh .\nThe theory is loosely evidenced by scripture , with the event of said division referred to historically in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divine \u201d rulers also seems to agree with the extremely long lifespans of the early biblical patriarchs , as well as the kings presented in the Sumerian kings list , the Aztec kings lists , the Mayan calendar , and the wall murals at the Egyptian site of Dendera , all of which speak of ancient rulers of former epochs whose lifespans reached the inhuman lengths of several thousands of years .\nRemarkably , if these legends contain even a grain of truth , this may provide some evidence that human civilization is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classicism ; an idea that has been gradually gaining traction in recent years with such archaeological bombshells as Gobekli Tepe and many other sites and finds which are pushing back long-held and ferociously guarded traditional dating and interpretations .\nCould the Cherubim Be Living Machines ?\nIsaiah is clear in presenting the cherubim as a living , intelligent being that is capable of occupying a position as a ruler over a city-state .\nEzekiel makes a similar case , when he speaks of \u201c four living creatures \u201d in his experience as described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAlthough he does not use the word cherubim in this description , he later has a second experience of the same creatures , as described in Ezekiel chapter 10 , and this time he does include their name ; cherubim .\nHowever , living these creatures may appear , Ezekiel \u2019 s description also contains many elements which seem to indicate a more machine-like quality to the cherubim .\nHe describes what appear to be separate mechanical components , using names which all end in the \u2018 im suffix , which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cherubim ; Ezekiel mentions the ophanim , panim , kenapayim , enayim , and sokekim .\nAll of these words present difficulty to translators for they only ever appear in this context and therefor lack a \u201c Rosetta Stone \u201d to enable reliable translation , however , when read in context they appear to be components of a highly technical system .\nIsaiah concurs with this in his narration , even going so far as to say that he heard the living beings specifically naming certain subcomponents .\nBoth Ezekiel and Isaiah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d but also the machinations of what appear to be some sort of flying ship .\nAccording to Ezekiel \u2019 s narrative , several metallic objects descend from the sky , accompanied by billowing thick clouds with lights shooting from within .\nEzekiel also employs the Hebrew term uma-asehem which translates to a more general term meaning machinery .\nIsaiah indicates that the machines are fueled by combustion and that this vehicle transports him from Babylon to Jerusalem , a distance of nearly 3,000 kilometers ( 1,864 mi ) .\nWhen taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the prophets \u2019 descriptions appear to indicate a type of smart machine , and the cherubim may be interpreted as some kind of robotic entity or perhaps parts of an advanced and almost intelligent control system .\nIn the book of Exodus , Yahweh handpicks a skilled craftsman named Bezalel to work on a special project .\nThe project includes the Tabernacle and the Ark of the Covenant , both of which are said to include cherubim .\nBezalel receives special detailed instructions from Yahweh regarding how to implement the cherubim to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss in further detail in my book UFOs in the Bible , these cherubim are not simply decorative embroidered tapestries and sculptures as is commonly believed .\nIn fact , the Israelites had just been given a commandment by God expressly forbidding them from creating visual and graphic arts .\n\u201c You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below , \u201d state the Ten Commandments in Exodus 20:4 .\nClearly , it is ludicrous to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then immediately turn around and order exactly such a project .\nRather , the work of Bezalel appears to be more closely related to the technical algorithms of computer engineering .\nThe Ark of the Covenant and the Tabernacle itself are fabricated to highly specific instructions out of materials including semiconducting metals and component arrangements recognizable to today \u2019 s electronic engineers .\nThese apparently high-tech items were themselves woven into the Hebrew religion at a fundamental level , becoming the central focus of the most holy rituals of ceremonial Judaism for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a trace into the mists of legend .\nThe Great Mystery of the Cherubim In a fascinating semantic twist , the modern Hebrew language may hold some subconscious ancient knowledge .\nKerub is a word in modern Hebrew which translates to \u201c approximation \u201d or \u201c estimation.\n\u201d This is a crucial concept to consider .\nWords themselves are merely representational of some underlying object or concept .\nThe words model the concepts .\nThey are not intended to be an exact representation , nor is such an intention possible .\nIs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cherubim are so inherently complex or alien that we can only hope to achieve a rough approximation of understanding ?\nIs this notion baked right into the Hebrew language to this day ?\nIt is certainly difficult to get a firm grasp on what the cherubim really are .\nThe truth is no one really knows what the cherubim are .\nAlthough the common perception is that they are small , baby-faced angels who live in the clouds , there is absolutely no evidence for such a conclusion in the ancient texts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart , yet machine-like , and in any case very strange .\nPerhaps if there is one thing we can learn from the cherubim , it is simply this : what we think we know is often wrong .\nBy Ken Goudsward , author of UFOs in the Bible .\nSource : Ancient-Origins.net", "author": "HAF", "url":

, IF they know what to do beforehand and have made even the most modest of preparations .\nTragically , though , most Americans today won \u2019 t give much credence to this good news , much less seek

bad they \u2019 ll wish they had .\nThat \u2019 s why you hear such absurd comments as ; \u201c If it happens , I hope I \u2019 m at ground zero and go quickly.\n\u201d This defeatist attitude was born as the disarmament movement ridiculed any competing alternatives to their ban-the-bomb agenda , like Civil Defense .\nThe activists wanted all to think there was no surviving any nukes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sound Civil Defense strategies of the 50 \u2019 s , 60 \u2019 s and 70 \u2019 s have been derided as being largely ineffective , or at worst a cruel joke .\nSince the supposed end of the Cold War in the 80 \u2019 s , most Americans saw neither a need to prepare , nor believed that preparation would do any good .\nToday , with growing prospects of nuclear terrorism , and nuclear saber rattling from rogue nations , we see emerging among the public either paralyzing fear or irrational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to envision effective preparations for ever surviving a nuclear attack .\nThey think it totally futile , bordering on lunacy , to even try .\nIronically , the disarmament activists legacy , regardless their noble intent , has rendered millions of Americans even more vulnerable

, IF the public was pre-trained through an aggressive national Civil Defense educational program .\nSimple measures taken immediately after a nuclear detonation , by a pre-trained public , can prevent agonizing death and injury from radiation exposure .\nThe National Planning Scenario # 1 , an originally confidential internal 2004 study by the Department of Homeland Security , examined the effects

another 15,000 casualties from the blast , thermal flash and initial radiation release.1 As horrific as that is , and even without \u2018 Duck & Cover \u2019 , the surprising revelation here is that over 99 % of the residents in the DC area will have just witnessed and survived their first nuclear explosion .\nClearly , the good news is most people would survive that initial blast .\nHowever , that study also soberly determined that as many as another 250,000 people could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of radiation from the fallout drifting downwind towards them after the blast .\n( Another study , released

estimated to be at risk downwind from fallout , again many more than from the initial blast itself.2 ) The good news here , that these much larger casualty numbers from radioactive fallout are largely avoidable , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Civil Defense program in what they need to do before it arrives .\nToday , lacking any meaningful Civil Defense program , millions of American families continue to be at risk and could perish needlessly for lack of essential knowledge that used to be taught at the grade school level .\nThe public at large , businesses and all our children \u2019 s schools ,

least in that building .\nIn other sections there was a heavy toll of serious injuries from flying glass \u2019 .\n\u201d Masao Komatsu , 40 , was hit by falling beam in a Hiroshima warehouse and was on board a train in Nagasaki when the bomb fell ( Trumbull , p101 ) : \u201c \u2026the interior of the coach was bathed in a stark , white light .\nKomatsu immediately dived for the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screamed at the other passengers .\nSome recovered sufficiently from the daze of the blinding light to react promptly to his warning .\nSeconds later came the deafening crack of the blast , and a shock wave that splintered all the windows on both sides of the train .\nThe passengers who had not dived under the seats were slashed mercilessly from waist to head by glass flying at bullet speed.\n\u201d While terrorist nukes would likely be smaller than the Hiroshima ( 15 KT ) bomb , in a modern super power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger , most in the 100 KT to 500 KT range .\nThe unsurvivable \u2018 ground zero \u2019 lethal zone of a 500 KT nuke airburst , would extend out to about 2.2 miles .\nThe blast wave would arrive at that 2.2 mile marker about eight seconds after the flash and then continue on causing death or injury from there out to about 9 miles .\nPutting at grave risk then an additional over 15 times more souls than were already lost within that unsurvivable 2.2 mile ground zero radius .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know to \u2018 Duck & Cover \u2019 in those 8 to 20+ seconds after the flash and before the blast wave arrived .\nIn other words , with \u2018 Duck & Cover \u2019 taught to and employed by all , there could be over 15 times fewer casualties from that blast wave !\n6 Clearly , prompt \u2018 Duck & Cover \u2019 , upon any bright flash suddenly appearing , is lifesaving good news everyone should be taught !\nThey need to also be taught , after the blast , attempting to outrun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly discouraged .\nIt only works if wind direction , speed , and distance from ground zero is known and assures plenty enough time to escape exposure in the open well before the fallout would arrive along their , likely clogged , route .\nThey must also be taught , sheltering-in-place is usually the better option , as the radioactive fallout loses 90 % of its lethal intensity in the first seven hours and 99 % of it in two days .\nFor those requiring sheltering from fallout , the majority would only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunkering down , not weeks on end , before safely joining an evacuation , if even still necessary then .\nThat \u2019 s more good news as an effective expedient fallout shelter can easily be improvised at home , school or work quickly , but , again , only IF the public had been trained beforehand in how to do so , as was begun in the 50 \u2019 s , 60 \u2019 s & 70 \u2019 s with our national Civil Defense program .\nUnfortunately , our government today is doing little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruction among the general public .\nRegrettably , most of our politicians , like the public , are still captive to the same illusions that training and preparation of the public are ineffective and futile against a nuclear threat .\nBush administration Department of Homeland Security head , Michael Chertoff , demonstrated this attitude in 2005 when he responded to the following question in USA Today:7 Q : In the last four years , the most horrific scenario \u2013 a nuclear attack \u2013 may be the least discussed .\nIf there were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an American city , how would it be handled ?\nA : In the area of a nuclear bomb , it \u2019 s prevention , prevention , prevention .\nIf a nuclear bomb goes off , you are not going to be able to protect against it .\nThere \u2019 s no city strong enough infrastructure-wise to withstand such a hit .\nNo matter how you approach it , there \u2019 d be a huge loss of life .\nMr. Chertoff failed to grasp that most of that \u201c huge loss of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the blast zone and downwind knew what to do beforehand .\nHe only acknowledges that the infrastructure will be severely compromised \u2013 too few first-responders responding .\nCivil Defense pre-training of the public is clearly the only hope for those in the blast zone and later in the fallout path .\nOf course , the government should try and prevent it happening first , but the answer he should have given to that question is ; \u201c preparation , preparation , preparation \u201d of the public via training beforehand , for when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Obama administration also failed to grasp that the single greatest force multiplier to reducing potential casualties , and greatly enhancing the effectiveness of first-responders , is a pre-trained public so that there will be far fewer casualties to later deal with .\nSpending millions to train and equip first-responders is good and necessary , but having millions fewer victims , by having also educated and trained the public beforehand , too , would be many magnitudes more effective in saving lives .\nMaybe the Trump administration will do better , but time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to launch a national mass media , business supported , and school based effort , superseding our most ambitious public awareness campaigns like for AIDs , drug abuse , drunk driving , anti-smoking , etc .\nThe effort should percolate down to every level of our society .\nLet \u2019 s be clear \u2013 we are talking about the potential to save , or lose needlessly , many times more lives than those saved by all these other noble efforts combined !\n# 2 \u2013 Continuity of Government ( COG ) and casualty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While the vital key component continues to be largely ignored\u2026 # 3 \u2013 Continuity of the Public while it \u2019 s happening \u2013 via proven mass media Civil Defense training beforehand that would make the survival difference then for the vast majority of Americans affected by a nuclear event and on their own from that first initial flash & blast and through those critical first couple days of the highest radiation threat , before government response has arrived in force .\nThis deadly oversight will persist until those crippling myths of nuclear un-survivability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trained and prepared public can , and ultimately has to , save themselves .\nMore training of the public beforehand means less body bags required afterwards , it \u2019 s that simple .\nThe tragic After Action Reports ( AAR \u2019 s ) , of an American city nuked today , would glaringly reveal then that the overwhelming majority of victims had perished needlessly for lack of this basic , easy to learn & employ , life-saving knowledge .\nRe-launching Civil Defense training is an issue we hope & pray will come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with both parties vying to outdo each other proposing national Civil Defense public educational programs .\nWe are not asking billions for provisioned public fallout shelters for all , like what already awaits many of our politicians .\nWe are just asking for a comprehensive mass media , business , and school based re-release of the proven practical strategies of Civil Defense instruction , a modernized version of what we used to have here , and that had been embraced by the Chinese , Russians , Swiss and Israeli \u2019 s .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ legitimate , primary responsibility of any government than to protect its citizens .\nAnd , no greater condemnation awaits that government that fails to , risking millions then perishing needlessly .\nWe all need to demand renewed public Civil Defense training and the media needs to spotlight it by questioning officials and politicians , until the government corrects this easily avoidable , but fatal vulnerability .\nIn the meantime , though , don \u2019 t wait around for the government to instruct and prepare your own family and community .\nEducate yourself today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survival preparations by reading the free nuke prep primer HERE .\nThen , post links to , or pass copies of , this \u2018 Good News \u2019 article to friends , neighbors , relatives , fellow workers , churches and community organizations with a brief note attached saying simply : \u201c We hope/pray we never need this , but just-in-case , keep it handy !\n\u201d Few nowadays will find that approach alarmist and you \u2019 ll be pleasantly surprised at how many are truly grateful .\nEveryone should also forward copies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representatives , as well as your own communities first-responders and local media , all to help spread this good news that \u2019 s liberating American families from their paralyzing and potentially fatal myths of nuclear un-survivability !\nBottom Line : We could easily reduce by 90 % the lethality of all Chinese , Russian , N Korean and Iranian missiles , and any terrorist nukes , too , quick as the public is trained up in blast & fallout Civil Defense basics again .\nAnd , that is very good news !\nDoctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this article : Toshiharu Kano , third generation Japanese-American , author of Passport to Hiroshima reminded us recently : \u201c I am the last , closest to ground zero ( 800 meters from hypocenter ) , living survivor of Hiroshima atomic bomb of August 1945 .\nMany of the tens of thousands of victims there tragically perished from an unfamiliarity of how to protect themselves from the unique effects of a nuclear bomb \u2019 s flash , blast and radiation .\nAs a US citizen living in middle America today I see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public here ever since Civil Defense was discontinued after the Reagan Cold War era .\n\u201c The \u2018 Good News About Nuclear Destruction \u2019 is that if all Americans were trained again in the Civil Defense basics of what to do and not do if nuclear weapons were ever unleashed again , we could instantly make all nukes 90 % less lethal .\nIdeally , while I \u2019 d like to see a world free of nuclear weapons someday , in the

surveillance and limiting their access to information doesn \u2019 t make them safer \u2014 in fact , research suggests just the opposite .\nUnfortunately those tactics are the ones endorsed by the Kids Online Safety Act of 2022 ( KOSA ) , introduced by Sens .\nBlumenthal and Blackburn .\nThe bill deserves credit for attempting to improve online data privacy for young people , and for attempting to update 1998 \u2019 s Children \u2019 s Online Privacy Protection Rule ( COPPA ) .\nBut its plan to require surveillance and censorship of anyone under sixteen would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of young people online .\nKOSA would require the following : \u2022 None A new legal duty for platforms to prevent certain harms : KOSA outlines a wide collection of content that platforms can be sued for if young people encounter it , including \u201c promotion of self-harm , suicide , eating disorders , substance abuse , and other matters that pose a risk to physical and mental health of a minor.\n\u201d \u2022 None An elaborate age-verification system , likely run by a third-party provider \u2022 None Parental controls , turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to block or filter a wide array of content There are numerous concerns with this plan .\nThe parental controls would in effect require a vast number of online platforms to create systems for parents to spy on \u2014 and control \u2014 the conversations young people are able to have online , and require those systems be turned on by default .\nIt would also likely result in further tracking of all users .\nData collection is a scourge for every internet user , regardless of age .\nAnd in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nearly every online platform would hide or remove huge swaths of content .\nAnd because each of the listed areas of concern involves significant gray areas , the platforms will over-censor to attempt to steer clear of the new liability risks .\nThese requirements would be applied far more broadly than the law KOSA hopes to update , COPPA .\nWhereas COPPA applies to anyone under thirteen , KOSA would apply to anyone under sixteen \u2014 an age group that child rights organizations agree have a greater need for privacy and independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in contrast to COPPA \u2019 s age self-verification scheme , KOSA would authorize a federal study of \u201c the most technologically feasible options for developing systems to verify age at the device or operating system level.\n\u201d Age verification systems are troubling \u2014 requiring such systems could hand over significant power , and private data , to third-party identity verification companies like Clear or ID.me .\nAdditionally , such a system would likely lead platforms to set up elaborate age-verification systems for everyone , meaning that all users would have to submit personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredibly broad definition of a covered platform would include any \u201c commercial software application or electronic service that connects to the internet and that is used , or is reasonably likely to be used , by a minor.\n\u201d That would likely encompass everything from Apple \u2019 s iMessage and Signal to web browsers , email applications and VPN software , as well as platforms like Facebook and TikTok \u2014 platforms with wildly different user bases and uses .\nIt \u2019 s also unclear how deep into the \u2018 tech stack \u2019 such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or domain registries likely aren \u2019 t the intended platforms for KOSA , but depending on interpretation , could be subject to its requirements .\nAnd , the bill raises concerns about how providers of end-to-end encrypted messaging platforms like iMessage , Signal , and WhatsApp would interpret their duty to monitor minors \u2019 communications , with the potential that companies will simply compromise encryption to avoid litigation .\nKOSA would force sites to use filters to block content \u2014 filters that we \u2019 ve seen , time and time again , fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from \u201c bad \u201d speech .\nThe types of content targeted by KOSA are complex , and often dangerous \u2014 but discussing them is not bad by default .\nIt \u2019 s very hard to differentiate between minors having discussions about these topics in a way that encourages them , as opposed to a way that discourages them .\nUnder this bill , all discussion and viewing of these topics by minors should be blocked .\nThe law requires platforms to ban the potentially infinite category of \u201c other matters that pose a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minor .\nResearch already exists showing bans like these don \u2019 t work : when Tumblr banned discussions of anorexia , it discovered that the keywords used in pro-anorexia content were the same ones used to discourage anorexia .\nOther research has shown that bans like these actually make the content easier to find by forcing people to create new keywords to discuss it ( for example , \u201c thinspiration \u201d became \u201c thynsperation \u201d ) .\nThe law also requires platforms to ban the potentially infinite category of \u201c other matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental health of a minor.\n\u201d As we \u2019 ve seen in the past , whenever the legality of material is up for interpretation , it is far more likely to be banned outright , leaving huge holes in what information is accessible online .\nThe law would seriously endanger access to information to teenagers , who may want to explore ideas without their parents knowledge or approval .\nFor example , they might have questions about sexual health that they do not feel safe asking their parents about , or they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating disorder or a substance abuse problem .\n( Research has shown that a large majority of young people have used the internet for health-related research . )\nKOSA would allow individual state attorneys general to bring actions against platforms when the state \u2019 s residents are \u201c threatened or adversely affected by the engagement of any person in a practice that violates this Act.\n\u201d This leaves it up to individual state attorneys general to decide what topics pose a risk to the physical and mental health of a minor .\nA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tennessee , has referred to education about race discrimination as \u201c dangerous for kids.\n\u201d Many states have agreed , and recently moved to limit public education about the history of race , gender , and sexuality discrimination .\nRecently , Texas \u2019 governor directed the state \u2019 s Department of Family and Protective Services to investigate gender affirming care as child abuse .\nKOSA would empower the Texas attorney general to define material that is harmful to children , and the current position of the state would include resources for trans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to force online services to remove and block access to that material everywhere \u2014 not only Texas .\nThat \u2019 s not to mention the frequent conflation by tech platforms of LGBTQ content with dangerous \u201c sexually explicit \u201d material .\nKOSA could result in loss of access to information that a vast majority of people would agree is not dangerous , but is under political attack .\nSome legitimate concerns are driving KOSA .\nData collection is a scourge for every internet user , regardless of age .\nInvasive tracking of young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2014 EFF has long pushed back against remote proctoring , for example .\nBut the answer to our lack of privacy isn \u2019 t more tracking .\nDespite the growing ubiquity of technology to make it easy , surveillance of young people is actually bad for them , even in the healthiest household , and is not a solution to helping young people navigate the internet .\nParents have an interest in deciding what their children can view online , but no one could argue that this interest is the same if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would put all children under sixteen in the same group , and require that specific types of content be hidden from them , and that other content be tracked and logged by parental tools .\nThis would force platforms to more closely watch what all users do .\nKOSA \u2019 s parental controls would give parents , by default , access to monitor and control a young person \u2019 s online use .\nWhile a tool like Apple \u2019 s Screen Time allows parents to restrict access to certain apps , or limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would need to do much more under KOSA .\nThey would have to offer parents the ability to modify the results of any algorithmic recommendation system , \u201c including the right to opt-out or down-rank types or categories of recommendations , \u201d effectively deciding for young people what they see \u2013 or don \u2019 t see \u2013 online .\nIt would also give parents the ability to delete their child \u2019 s account entirely if they \u2019 re unhappy with their use of the platform .\nThe answer to our lack of privacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill tackles algorithmic systems by requiring that platforms provide \u201c an overview of how algorithmic recommendation systems are used \u2026to provide information to users of the platform who are minors , including how such systems use personal data belonging to minors.\n\u201d Transparency about how a platform \u2019 s algorithms work , and tools to allow users to open up and create their own feeds , are critical for wider understanding of algorithmic curation , the kind of content it can incentivize , and the consequences it can have .\nEFF has also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content they see online .\nBut KOSA requires that parents be able to opt-out or down-rank types or categories of recommendations , without the consent or knowledge of the user , including teenage users .\nLastly , under KOSA , platforms would be required to prevent patterns of use that indicate addiction , and to offer parents the ability to limit features that \u201c increase , sustain , or extend use of the covered platform by a minor , such as automatic playing of media , rewards for time spent on the platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patterns that can trick users into giving up personal information is a laudable goal , determining what features \u201c cause addiction \u201d is highly fraught .\nIf a sixteen year-old spends three hours a day on Discord working through schoolwork or discussing music with their friends , would that qualify as \u201c addictive \u201d behavior ?\nKOSA would likely cover features as different as Netflix \u2019 s auto-playing of episodes and iMessage \u2019 s new message notifications .\nPutting these features together under the heading of \u201c addictive \u201d misunderstands which dark patterns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nEFF has long supported comprehensive data privacy legislation for all users .\nBut the Kids Online Safety Act would not protect the privacy of children or adults .\nIt is a heavy-handed plan to force technology companies to spy on young people and stop them from accessing

has more control over everything and the people don \u2019 t have much control over anything .\nEveryone starts off with so many points .\nAnd a smart app on every phone measures behaviour and helps the authorities decide whether or not you are good citizen .\nThere are , of course , video cameras absolutely everywhere watching to see whether you cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke in public , throw down litter or do anything considered anti-social or inappropriate .\nIf you talk to the wrong sort of people you \u2019 ll find your credit rating goes down .\nStand and talk to me and you \u2019 ll get

lose you points as will being arrested ( it doesn \u2019 t matter whether you are found guilty ) .\nHaving too big a carbon footprint , being middle class or white or asking too many questions will

another person .\nYour intention will be irrelevant .\nThe complainant only has to say he was hurt .\nWriters , actors or film or stage directors could be charged if anyone finds any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t appear much in the future .\nYou probably think I \u2019 m really kidding now .\nIf you do just check out what is happening in Scotland .\nIn the UK , the police now define a crime or

to find out what your social credit score is , to find out exactly how scores are made up or to correct any error .\nAnd scores will be changed in real time .\nSo you could join a queue thinking you are entitled to hire a car or board a train and find , when you get to the front of the queue that your rating has changed and you can \u2019 t do either of those things .\nGovernments , big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information about you from facial recognition cameras , biometric studies at airports , drones , surveillance planes and social media .\nThis is the technocratic state in full fly .\nUsing a silly

in a religious ceremony will result in punishment .\nYou may , for example , be sent to an education and training centre where the inmates study political propaganda .\nEvery time you give information on line they are storing up information about you , your views , your personality and so on .\nAnd there are so , so many ways in which your social credit score can be adversely affected .\nIf you drop rubbish in a public place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points .\nIn Thailand , tourists who drop rubbish in a national park must give their name and address .\nIf they leave rubbish behind they are in trouble .\nAll this is known as social engineering .\nIt \u2019 s something politicians have been trying to do for many years since , when it works , which it does , it gives them complete control over the population .\nThere is no longer any need to worry about opposition or criticism .\nIn China , citizens who do ` good \u2019 things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rewarded by having their photographs and names on a local wall .\nThis is exactly what I remember seeing in East Germany in the 1970s .\nAnd back then people vied with one another to please the State and win a place on the wall .\nSo , again , if you want to know the sort of society you and your children will live in then look at China now where what people do , say and think is being monitored .\nBut our future won \u2019 t be so free and @ @ @ @

.\nPeople who speak out about corruption or who question the propaganda will be punished .\nIf they are fined then their fine will be higher because they are seen as bad people .\nAnd it \u2019 s already all happening .\nComputer games are training us for our future .\nI \u2019 m banned in China because I wrote a column for a Chinese newspaper which was considered unacceptable .\nMy books in

!\nRussia \u2019 s military operations in Ukraine have been going on for more than a month and NATO \u2019 s propaganda operations for a month and a half .\nAs always , the war propaganda of the Anglo-Saxons is coordinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War , the British have acquired an unparalleled know-how .\nIn 1914 , they had managed to convince their own population that the German army had carried out mass rapes in Belgium and that it was the duty of every Briton to come to the rescue of these poor women .\nIt was a cleaner version of Kaiser Wilhelm II \u2019 s attempt to compete with the British colonial empire .\nAt the end of the conflict , the British population demanded that the victims be compensated .\nA census was taken and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been extraordinarily exaggerated .\nThis time , in 2022 , the British managed to convince the Europeans that on February 24 the Russians had attacked Ukraine to invade and annex it .\nMoscow was trying to reconstitute the Soviet Union and was preparing to attack all its former possessions in succession .\nThis version is more honorable for the West than evoking the \u201c Thucydides trap \u201d \u2013 I will come back to this .\nIn reality , Kiev \u2019 s troops attacked their own population in Donbass on the afternoon of February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rag in front of the Russian bull with President Zelenskyy \u2019 s speech to the political and military leaders of NATO gathered in Munich , during which he announced that his country was going to acquire nuclear weapons to protect itself from Russia .\nDon \u2019 t believe me ?\nHere are the OSCE readings from the Donbass border .\nThere had been no fighting for months , but the observers of the neutral organization observed 1,400 explosions per day as of the afternoon of February 17 .\nImmediately , the rebel provinces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered themselves Ukrainian but claimed autonomy within Ukraine , moved more than 100,000 civilians to protect them .\nMost retreated to the interior of Donbass , others fled to Russia .\nIn 2014 and 2015 , when a civil war had pitted Kiev against Donestk and Lugansk , the material and human damage was only a matter of Ukraine \u2019 s internal affairs .\nHowever , in the course of time , almost the entire Ukrainian population of Donbass considered emigrating and acquired dual Russian citizenship .\nTherefore , Kiev \u2019 s attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17 was an attack on Ukrainian-Russian citizens .\nMoscow came to their rescue , in an emergency , from February 24 .\nThe chronology is indisputable .\nIt was not Moscow that wanted this war , but Kiev , despite the predictable price it would have to pay .\nPresident Zelenskyy deliberately put his people in danger and bears sole responsibility for what they are enduring today .\nWhy did he do this ?\nSince the beginning of his term , Volodymyr Zelenskyy has continued the support of the Ukrainian state , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the embezzlement of funds by his American sponsors and for the extremists in his country , the Banderists .\nPresident Putin called the former \u201c a bunch of drug addicts \u201d and the latter \u201c a bunch of neo-Nazis \u201d [ 1 ] .\nNot only did Volodymyr Zelensky publicly declare that he did not want to solve the conflict in Donbass by implementing the Minsk Agreements , but he banned his fellow citizens from speaking Russian in schools and administrations and , worse , signed a racial law on July 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claiming their Slavic origin from the enjoyment of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms .\nThe Russian army first invaded Ukrainian territory , not from the Donbass , but from Belarus and Crimea .\nIt destroyed all Ukrainian military installations used by NATO for years and fought the Bandit regiments .\nIt is now dedicated to annihilating them in the east of the country .\nThe propagandists in London and their almost 150 communication agencies around the world assure us that , pushed back by the glorious Ukrainian Resistance , the defeated Russian army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking Kiev .\nHowever , never , absolutely never , did President Putin say that Russia would take Kiev , overthrow the elected President Zelenskyy and occupy his country .\nOn the contrary , he has always said that his war aims were to denazify Ukraine and eliminate foreign ( NATO ) weapons stockpiles .\nThis is exactly what he is doing .\nThe Ukrainian population is suffering .\nWe are discovering that war is cruel , that it always kills innocent people .\nToday we are overwhelmed by our emotions and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ February 17 , we blame the Russians , whom we wrongly call \u201c aggressors \u201d .\nWe do not feel the same compassion for the victims of the simultaneous war in Yemen , its 200,000 dead , including 85,000 children , who died of hunger .\nBut it is true that the Yemenis are , in the eyes of the West , \u201c only Arabs \u201d .\nThe fact of suffering should not be interpreted a priori as proof that one is right .\nCriminals suffer like the innocent .\nHow is such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 ] Ukraine referred to the fact that President Putin , during his speech on the Russian military operation , said that the people of Donbass were victims of \u201c genocide \u201d .\nShe therefore denied this \u201c genocide \u201d and accused Russia of having used this argument improperly .\nIn international law , the word \u201c genocide \u201d no longer refers to the eradication of an ethnic group , but to a massacre ordered by a government .\nOver the past eight years , between 13,000 and 22,000 civilians have been killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one refers to Ukrainian or Russian government statistics .\nRussia , which had sent its plea in writing , argues that it is not relying on the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide , but on Article 51 of the UN Charter , which authorizes war in self-defence , as President Putin had explicitly stated in his speech .\nThe Tribunal did not attempt to verify anything .\nIt stuck to the Ukrainian denial .\nIt therefore concluded that Russia had improperly used the Convention as an argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider it necessary to be physically represented at the Court , the Court used its absence to impose an aberrant provisional measure .\nRussia , sure of its good right , refused to comply and is demanding a judgment on the merits , which will not be given before the end of September .\nAll this being said , we can only understand the duplicity of the West if we put the events in their context .\nFor a decade , American political scientists have been telling us that the rise of Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war .\nThe political scientist Graham Allison created the concept of the \u201c Thucydides trap \u201d [ 3 ] .\nHe was referring to the Peloponnesian wars that opposed Sparta and Athens in the fourth century BC..\nThe strategist and historian Thucydides analyzed that the wars had become inevitable when Sparta , which dominated Greece , realized that Athens was conquering an empire and could replace its hegemony .\nThe analogy is telling , but false : while Sparta and Athens were close Greek cities , the United States , Russia and China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China , for example , rejects President Biden \u2019 s proposal for trade competition .\nInstead , it has the opposite tradition of \u201c win-win \u201d .\nIn doing so , it is not referring to mutually beneficial trade contracts , but to its history .\nThe \u201c Middle Kingdom \u201d has an extremely large population .\nThe emperor was forced to delegate his authority to the maximum .\nEven today China is the most decentralized country in the world .\nWhen he issued a decree , it had practical consequences in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The emperor therefore had to make sure that each local governor would not consider his decree irrelevant and forget his authority .\nHe then offered compensation to those who were not affected by the decree so that they would still feel subject to his authority .\nSince the beginning of the Ukrainian crisis , China has not only taken a non-aligned position , but has protected its Russian ally in the UN Security Council .\nThe United States has wrongly feared that Beijing would send weapons to Moscow .\nThis has never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance in the form of prepared meals for the soldiers , for example .\nChina is watching how things are going and deducing how they will go when it tries to get the rebel province of Taiwan back .\nBeijing has kindly declined Washington \u2019 s offers .\nIt is thinking in the long term and knows from experience that if it allows Russia to be destroyed , it will once again be plundered by the West .\nIts salvation is only possible with Russia , even if it must one day challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back to Thucydides \u2019 trap .\nRussia knows that the United States wants to erase it from the scene .\nIt anticipates a possible invasion/destruction .\nBut its territory is immense and its population insufficiently large .\nIt can not defend its overly large borders .\nSince the 19th century , it has imagined defending itself by hiding from its adversaries .\nWhen Napoleon , then Hitler , attacked her , she moved her population further and further east .\nAnd it burned its own cities before the invader arrived .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops .\nHe had to face the winter without means and , finally , retreat .\nThis \u201c scorched earth \u201d strategy only worked because neither Napoleon nor Hitler had logistical bases nearby .\nModern Russia knows that it can not survive if US weapons are stored in Central and Eastern Europe .\nThat is why , at the end of the Soviet Union , Russia demanded that NATO never expand eastward .\nFrench President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and German Chancellor Helmut K\u00f6hl , who knew history , demanded that the West make this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reunification , they drafted and signed a treaty guaranteeing that NATO would never cross the Oder-Neisse line , the German-Polish border .\nRussia set this commitment in stone in 1999 and in 2010 with the OSCE declarations in Istanbul and Astana .\nBut the United States violated it in 1999 ( accession of the Czech Republic , Hungary and Poland to Nato ) , in 2004 ( Bulgaria , Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , Romania , Slovakia and Slovenia ) , in 2009 ( Albania and Croatia ) , in 2017 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Northern Macedonia ) .\nThe problem is not that all these states have allied themselves with Washington , but that they have stored U.S. weapons at home .\nNo one is criticizing these states for choosing their allies , but Moscow is blaming them for serving as a rear base for the Pentagon in preparation for an attack by Russia .\nIn October 2021 , the Straussian Victoria Nuland [ 4 ] , the State Department \u2019 s number 2 , came to Moscow to urge Russia to accept the deployment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nShe promised that Washington would invest in Russia in return .\nThen she threatened Russia if it did not accept her offer and concluded that he would have President Putin tried before an international tribunal .\nMoscow responded with a proposal for a treaty guaranteeing peace on the basis of respect for the United Nations Charter on December 17 .\nThis is what has caused the current storm .\nRespecting the Charter , which is based on the principle of the equality and sovereignty of states , implies reforming NATO , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its members .\nCaught in the \u201c Thucydides trap \u201d , the United States then fomented the current war in Ukraine .\nIf we admit that their goal is to remove Russia from the international scene , the way the Anglo-Saxons react to the Ukrainian crisis becomes clear .\nThey are not trying to push back the Russian army militarily , nor to embarrass the Russian government , but to wipe out all traces of Russian culture in the West .\nAnd secondly , they are trying to weaken the European Union .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets of Russian oligarchs in the West , a measure that was applauded by the Russian population , which considers them illegitimate beneficiaries of the plundering of the USSR .\nThen they imposed on Western companies to stop their activities with Russia .\nFinally , they continued by cutting off Russian banks \u2019 access to Western banks ( the SWIFT system ) .\nHowever , if these financial measures were disastrous for Russian banks ( but not for the Russian government ) , the measures against companies working in Russia are on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investments at lower costs .\nMoreover , the Moscow Stock Exchange , which had been closed from February 25 ( the day after the Russian response ) to March 24 , recorded an increase as soon as it reopened .\nThe RTS index fell by 4.26 % on the first day , but it measures mainly speculative stocks , while the IMOEX index , which measures national economic activity , rose by 4.43 % .\nThe real losers of the Western measures are the members of the European Union who had the stupidity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Straussian Paul Wolfowitz wrote in an official report that the USA should prevent a power from developing to the point of competing with it .\nAt the time , the USSR was in tatters .\nSo he named the European Union as the potential rival to be destroyed [ 5 ] .\nThis is exactly what he did in 2003 , when , as number 2 in the Pentagon , he forbade Germany and France to participate in the reconstruction of Iraq [ 6 ] .\nThis is also what Victoria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructed her US ambassador in Kiev to \u201c fuck the European Union \u201d ( sic ) [ 7 ] .\nThe European Union has now been ordered to stop its imports of Russian hydrocarbons .\nIf it complies with this injunction , Germany will be ruined and with it the whole Union .\nThis will not be collateral damage , but the fruit of structured thinking , clearly expressed for thirty years .\nThe most important thing for Washington is to exclude Russia from all international organizations .\nIt has already managed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the G8 .\nThe pretext was not the independence of Crimea ( which it had been demanding since the dissolution of the USSR , several months before Ukraine thought of its own independence ) , but its membership in the Russian Federation .\nUkraine \u2019 s alleged aggression provides a pretext for excluding it from the G20 .\nChina immediately pointed out that no one could be excluded from an informal forum without a constitution .\nHowever , President Biden returned to the charge on March 24 and 25 in Europe .\nWashington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the World Trade Organization .\nIn any case , the principles of the WTO are being undermined by the unilateral \u201c sanctions \u201d implemented by the West .\nSuch a decision would be detrimental to both sides .\nThis is where the writings of Paul Wolfowitz come into play .\nHe wrote in 1991 that Washington should not seek to be the best at what it does , but to be the first in relation to others .\nThis implies , he noted , that in order to maintain its hegemony , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt itself , if it does much more to others .\nWe will all pay the price for this way of thinking .\nThe most important thing for the Straussians is to exclude Russia from the United Nations .\nThis is not possible if one respects the UN Charter , but Washington will not bother with it there any more than elsewhere .\nIt has already contacted every member state of the UN with a few exceptions .\nThe Anglo-Saxon propaganda has already succeeded in making them believe that a member of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of conquest against one of its neighbors .\nIf Washington succeeds in convening a special UN General Assembly and changing the statutes , it will succeed .\nA kind of hysteria has taken hold of the West .\nEverything Russian is being hunted down without thinking about its links with the Ukrainian crisis .\nRussian artists are forbidden to perform even if they are known to be opposed to President Putin .\nHere a university bans the study of the anti-Soviet hero Solzhenitsyn from their curriculum , there another bans the writer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) who opposed the tsarist regime .\nHere a conductor is deprogrammed because he is Russian and there Tchaikovsky ( 1840-1893 ) is removed from the repertoire .\nEverything Russian must disappear from our consciousness , just as the Roman Empire razed Carthage and methodically destroyed all traces of its existence , to the point that today we know little about this civilization .\nOn March 21 , President Biden made no secret of the fact .\nIn front of an audience of business leaders , he said : \u201c This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be a New World Order and we have to lead it .\nAnd we have to unite the rest of the free world to do it \u201d [ 8 ] .\nUkrainian PM Says Quiet Part Out Loud : \u2018 We Not Only Fight For Ukraine \u2013 We Fight For This New World Order \u2019 .\nThis new order [ 9 ] should cut the world into two hermetic blocks ; a cut such as we have never known , without comparison with the Iron Curtain of the Cold War .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that they can lose a lot like the others , but also gain a little .\nThus , General Waldemar Skrzypczak has just demanded that the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad become Polish [ 10 ] .\nIndeed , after the world has been

DeSantis \u2019 head on a platter , and rages about how Will Smith slapping Chris Rock was peak racism , actual real world and potentially catastrophic issues are unfolding around us .\nFighting to teach 5-year-olds about sexuality will seem like a fools errand given the looming disaster on the horizon .\nJust this week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schwab wared that \u201c History is truly at a turning point .\nWe do not yet know the full extent and the systemic and structural changes which will happen \u201d but he said that \u201c we do know the global energy systems , food systems , and supply chains will be deeply affected.\n\u201d It \u2019 s not just the real-life version of Dr .\nEvil making these warnings either .\nThe president of the ominously connected multi-trillion-dollar asset fund , BlackRock , Rob Kapito just told oil and gas executives on Tuesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deal with shortages of food and other goods , and should prepare accordingly .\nMust-read : BlackRock CEO Demands Ukraine is Used to Accelerate Introduction of Government-Controlled Digital Currency .\n\u201c For the first time , this generation is going to go into a store and not be able to get what they want , \u201d Kapito told a meeting of the Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association .\n\u201c And we have a very entitled generation that has never had to sacrifice.\n\u201d \u201c I would put on your seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haven \u2019 t seen , \u201d Kapito added , warning that Americans will soon face \u201c scarcity inflation \u201d \u2013 or rising prices compounded by shortages of everything from food and consumer goods to oil and gas .\nPresident Joe Biden has been telling Americans for a month now that they have to foot the bill for the war in Ukraine and \u201c do their part \u201d by sending billions to Zelensky and paying high prices for oil .\nThis week , Biden took this position to a whole new level , telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na be real.\n\u201d Though the government has been telling us these higher prices and supply chain issues are Russia \u2019 s fault , those who have been paying attention have warned since last year that Biden \u2019 s policies \u2013 which involved spending more in his first eight months than former President Donald Trump did in 2018 and 2019 combined , and throttling domestic energy production \u2013 would trigger price spikes and supply chain disruptions for ordinary Americans .\nTrump definitely played a role as well by printing nearly 7 trillion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is why inflation was already at a 40-year high , before the war began and as spending increases , hard times are seemingly inevitable .\nThe Ukraine invasion is most assuredly playing a role in this debacle but it will be the straw that broke the camels back , not the main driver .\nIn Canada , their tyrant in chief , Justin Trudeau is making similar predictions .\nInstead of just Ukraine , however , Trudeau is blaming their upcoming food shortages on COVID-19 .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve seen\u2026 disruptions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is resulting in higher prices for consumers and democracies , like ours , and resulting in significant shortages and projected shortages of food , of energy in places around the world .\nThis is going to be a difficult time because of the war , because of the recovery from the pandemic , \u201d Trudeau told reporters in Vancouver last week .\nWhatever actually sets off this shortage , rest assured that the people warning us about it will be the last to suffer from it .\nIt will be the poor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these issues .\nIn the short term , if you \u2019 d like to know how to defend yourself against these things , you can purchase storable food , or make your own .\nRice and dried beans have very long shelf lives as well as honey , rolled oats , cornmeal , quinoa , and lentils .\nIf you \u2019 d like to get involved in a longer more sustainable plan , take a look at this article by Don Via Jr. , here .\nAs Via points out : \u201c Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to opt out from this broken abusive system is vital for our civilization to take its next step in evolution .\nThe solutions for humanity to begin moving towards a freer , more peaceful , prosperous and sustainable world exist .\nBut we have to act on developing these strategies and creating new ones ; as individuals , and in doing so encouraging the togetherness to

on digital identity opposing the idea .\nOn April 6 , 2022 , new digital identity document verification technology ( IDVT ) that enables data sharing between public bodies and businesses for the purpose of identity verification will be introduced .\nIt will be made available to UK employers , landlords , and letting agents who can use it to digitally carry out pre-employment criminal record checks , right to work checks , and right to rent checks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is part of the government \u2019 s far-reaching digital ID plans which were announced in March .\nThe government has framed these digital ID plans as a way for UK citizens to \u201c easily and quickly prove their identity using digital methods instead of having to rely on traditional physical documents.\n\u201d Under these digital ID plans , UK citizens will be able to \u201c create a digital identity with a trusted organisation \u201d which can be used \u201c in-person or online \u201d and \u201c via a phone app or website.\n\u201d These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c legal gateway \u201d to \u201c carry out verification checks against official data held by public bodies to help validate a person \u2019 s

The trusted organisations that provide these digital identity solutions will need to get accredited and certified under legislation that the government plans to introduce .\nOnce accredited and certified , they \u2019 ll be \u201c given a trust mark to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as being a trust-marked organisation.\n\u201d A new interim governing body , the Office for Digital Identities and Attributes ( ODIA ) , will be set up in the Department for Digital , Culture , Media , and Sport ( DCMS ) and it will have the power to issue these trust marks .\nThe ODIA will also publish a publicly viewable list of trust-marked organisations .\nOther companies that rely on the digital identity solutions provided by trust-marked organizations won \u2019 t need to be certified but may be subject to \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not share the information they receive .\nBefore announcing these digital ID plans , the government sought views and feedback on its proposed approach to digital identity via a public consultation .\n50 % of the responses to this consultation were \u201c against digital identity in principle \u201d but the government didn \u2019 t include these responses in its statistical analysis of responses to the consultation because they \u201c did not engage with the questions.\n\u201d However , the government insisted that \u201c outside the context of producing the statistical analysis , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of this consultation exercise.\n\u201d The government also admitted that some respondents feared that \u201c digital identities are going to be made mandatory for all people \u201d but dismissed these concerns as \u201c false \u201d and said it will seek feedback on how to \u201c encourage more inclusive digital identities.\n\u201d \u201c As set out in the consultation , there are no plans to make digital identities mandatory , but we recognise they are an emerging technology and people may not be fully aware of the privacy and security benefits , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will take steps to increase understanding amongst potential users and engage with civil society groups to receive their expert feedback on how to increase inclusion , now and into the future.\n\u201d

the UK government embraced jjab passports \u2013 a technology that shares many similarities with digital ID by requiring citizens to use a digital pass .\nThese jjab passports were used to scoop up

black .\nDr. Kuo Ta-Wei , Director of Fu Yuan Chinese Medicine Clinic , gave us a story that made us wonder if our white hair would stay with us forever .\n\u201c In an integrated Chinese and Western therapy programme during the acute treatment of stroke , there was a 75-year old woman who was paralysed and motionless .\nWe did the scalp acupuncture to stimulate the activation of acupoints , \u201d Dr. Kuo said .\n\u201c During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scalp acupuncture points completely turned black .\nAfter she recovered , she said she looked younger after the stroke , \u201d he said .\n\u201c Because head acupuncture treatment helps to vitalize the body , enhances the metabolism , and especially stimulates the hair follicles , her grey hair gradually turned into black.\n\u201d Although not everyone can afford scalp acupuncture , Dr. Kuo believes that a decent scalp massage with a comb or fingertips can revitalise the scalp in a similar way .\n\u201c Sun Simiao , the king of medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 rules to good health.\n\u2019 The first rule was to comb your hair often , and to comb it from the front of the scalp to the back , \u201d Dr. Kuo said .\n\u201c Well , even if you don \u2019 t have a comb , you can rub your hands until they \u2019 re warm , and massage your scalp from the front to the back along the meridian .\nThis is all to help activate qi ( energy ) and blood and stimulate the meridians.\n\u201d To begin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times to warm them up .\nThen , starting at the forehead and working your way back across the back of your head , comb your hair with your hands .\nEvery morning and evening , do this ten times .\n\u201c There are many important acupuncture points on the head .\nDoing this exercise often can improve eyesight and expel obstacles that cause stagnation of qi , prevent headaches , tinnitus , grey hair , and hair loss , \u201d Dr. Kuo said .\n1 .\nAvoid having a mouth full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generated by dense teeth combs , which affects the hair root while combing and pulls at the hair .\n2 .\nStay away from plastic combs .\nIt is preferable to use a comb composed of soft rubber , wood , or horn .\nBecause the plastic comb is fairly firm , it is possible to injure the scalp with it .\n3 .\nAvoid using a comb with sharp teeth .\nThe scalp might be scratched and irritated by a sharp one .\nAside from combing , Dr. Kuo provided us with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat with stewed , steamed , or roasted meat , and reduce the amount of spiciness in your meals , \u201d Dr. Kuo adviced .\n\u201c Spicy food stimulated the sympathetic nerve system to secrete adrenaline , which reduces the secretion of melanin , consequently resulting in white hair.\n\u201d \u201c Get a good balance of proteins , zinc , the vitamin B group ; this will reduce problems like oily scalps , hair loss , and grey hair , \u201d Dr. Kuo added .\nWalnuts , black sesame seeds , mulberries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the foods he recommends .\nMany dark foods , incidentally , are beneficial for the kidneys , which are responsible in traditional Chinese medicine for nourishing the body in a way that results in healthy hair .\n\u201c Adopt a healthy routine by avoiding staying up , smoking , drinking alcohol ; and sleep well and exercise properly , \u201d he said .\n\u201c Oily scalp is related to diet and sleep , for the most part , though your genetics have to do with it as well.\n\u201d \u201c Many patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oily scalp , \u201d Dr. Kuo said .\n\u201c It can have to do with staying up too late , stress , exhaustion , thinking too much and anxiety , psychological trauma , and accidents.\n\u201d Dr. Kuo has seen many of his patients suffer emotionally as a result of lockdowns , and many of them have poor sleep quality as a result .\nHe went on to say that we need to relieve tension and strain in our life on a regular basis , and that in some circumstances , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss problems .\nFrequent chemical processing , such as dying and perming , increases not only the danger of hair loss , but also the chance of bladder cancer , according to studies .\n\u201c Even if you \u2019 re using natural products , it will slightly damage the scalp , and it \u2019 s bad for the hair follicles , \u201d Dr. Kuo said .\n\u201c Don \u2019 t use poor quality shampoo either.\n\u201d \u201c Do not pull out your grey hairs .\nPulling them damages and stimulates the surrounding hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster , \u201d he added .\nWhen shampooing , massage your scalp in addition to brushing your hair .\nWhile you \u2019 re washing your hair , press your fingertips on the scalp .\nWhen shampooing , Dr. Kuo recommends pressing both thumbs on the acupoint in the centre of the forehead , the acupoint in the centre of the crown , and the acupoint toward the centre of the base of the skull with two thumbs to relieve pressure on the scalp , improve blood circulation , and make your hair healthier @", "author": "HAF",

Reset \u201d way back in 2014 .\nChristine Lagarde , who was head of the IMF at the time , was suddenly becoming very vocal about global centralization .\nIt was an agenda that was generally only whispered about in the dark corners of institutional white papers and the secretive meetings of banking elites , but now these people were becoming rather loud about it .\nLagarde was doing a Q & A at the World Economic Forum and the notion of the \u201c Reset \u201d was very deliberately brought up ; what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basic root of it was a dramatic shift away from the current economic , social and political models of the world into a globally centralized and integrated system \u2013 A \u201c New World Order , \u201d if you will\u2026 It \u2019 s important to remember that we had just jumped through the fires of an international credit collapse which started in 2008 and had continued to cause uncertainty in markets for years .\nThe central banks had dumped tens of trillions of dollars worth of stimulus into the system just to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us in the alternative media believed that these actions were not meant to save the economy , only zombify the economy through currency devaluation and inflation .\nNot long down the road , this zombie creation would turn on us and try to eat us alive , and only the central bankers new exactly when this would occur .\nThink of the crash of 2008 as Stage 1 of the Reset agenda ; the globalists were getting cocky and were ready to unveil their plans to the public .\nLagarde \u2019 s discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time that Klaus Schwab was introducing his 4th Industrial Revolution concept , which is a little more forward with what the globalists really want .\nHe talks excitedly of a true \u201c global society \u201d and a world in which people turn to Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) as a better means of governance .\nHe even suggests that laws would eventually be dictated by AI and that courts would be run by robots .\nOf course , he admits that this can not happen without a period of economic deconstruction in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose between sacrifice for the sake of stability or continued pain in the name of holding on to the \u201c old ways.\n\u201d Look at it this way : The Great Reset is the action or the chaos , and the 4th Industrial Revolution is the intended result or planned \u201c order.\n\u201d That is to say , it \u2019 s a new order created out of engineered chaos .\nYeah , it sounds like bad science fiction , but remember these are the people that enjoy the undivided attention of many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the central bankers at the Federal Reserve .\nI \u2019 ll say it again : The proponents of the Great Reset and the 4th Industrial Revolution , who want to completely undermine and reconstitute our society and way of life , are close partners with our national leaders and the very bankers that could force such a reset to happen through a deliberate collapse .\nThe globalists have been trying to rebrand and repackage their New World Order agenda for many years , and the Reset was what they came up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the term threatens systemic upheaval and an erasure of the past .\nWhen you \u201c reset \u201d something it usually goes back to zero \u2013 A blank slate that the engineers can use to rewrite the code and the functions .\nBut what does this really mean ?\nWhat do the globalists REALLY WANT ?\nHere are the details , so far as I can prove or support with evidence , of what the \u201c Great Reset \u201d actually is and what programs they hope to enforce : Some people might claim that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they don \u2019 t understand what this really means .\nWhile national central banks are all members of the IMF and the Bank for International Settlements and take their marching ordersfrom these institutions , what the globalists want is open global governance of finance , probably through the IMF .\nIn other words , it \u2019 s not enough that they manipulate economies secretly by using national central banks as proxies ; what they want is to stop hiding and to come out into the light as the magnanimous rulers they think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full centralization is to erase the very idea of free markets and to allow a handful of people to micromanage every aspect of trade and business .\nIt \u2019 s not just about influence , it \u2019 s about economic empire .\nBut in order to achieve a global central bank they must first implement a one world currency plan .\nThe IMF has been talking about using their Special Drawing Rights basket as the foundation for a global currency for years ( since at least the year 2000 ) .\nAround a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dollars in debt just to qualify as a member of the SDR system , and the IMF has hinted that when all is said and done that system will go digital .\nAll that is needed is the right kind of crisis to shock the public into compliance .\nThis was evident at the height of the covid pandemic lockdowns and the threat of economic disaster when globalist institutions began to suggest that the IMF \u2019 s SDR could be used as a safety net for nations , with strings attached , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pandemic there is a much bigger crisis ; namely the stagflationary crisis now on our doorstep .\nWith multiple national currencies in decline and the dollar \u2019 s world reserve status increasingly in question , I have no doubt that the globalists will take the opportunity to offer the public their digital currency as a solution .\nThe new system would be more like a phantom currency for a time .\nThe SDR would be the glue or the backing while national currencies remain in circulation until the digital framework becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind it would become the defacto world central bank , with the power to steer the course of all national economies through a single currency mechanism .\nOn the micro-economic side , each and every individual would now be dependent on a digital currency or cryptocurrency which removes all privacy in trade .\nAll transactions would be tracked , and by the very nature of blockchain technology and the digital ledger this would be required .\nThe money elites wouldn \u2019 t have to explain the tracking , all they would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the technology functions ; without the ledger it doesn \u2019 t work.\n\u201d The evil inherent in globalism was readily apparent during the recent lockdowns and the violent push for medical tyranny .\nDespite the fact that covid only had a median Infection Fatality Rate of only 0.27 % according to dozens of official studies , the WEF contingent of politicians and world leaders were frothing at the mouth , proclaiming that the existence of covid gave them the right to take total control of people \u2019 s lives .\nKlaus Schwab and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the beginning of the \u201c Great Reset \u201d and the 4th Industrial Revolution , stating that the covid crisis presented a perfect \u201c opportunity \u201d for change .\nThe jjab passports were thankfully defeated by numerous conservative red states in the US , leading to the complete reversal of such policies across most of the western world .\nWe were free for years while many blue states and other countries were facing authoritarianism and this caused a lot of problems for the globalists .\nIt \u2019 s hard to institute a global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can look at the conservatives in the US and see that we are living just fine without the controls .\nThe vax passports need to be understood as a first step towards something else \u2013 The beginning of a massive social credit system much like the one being used in China right now .\nIf you think cancel culture is a nightmare today , just think what would happen if the collectivist mob had the power to drop a review bomb on your social credit account and declare you to be untouchable ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply shut down your ability to

threat which must be confronted by everyone together .\nBut in designating these dangers as the enemy , we fall into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warned readers about , namely mistaking symptoms for causes .\nAll these dangers are caused by human intervention in natural processes , and it is only through changed attitudes and behaviour that they can be overcome .\nThe real enemy then is humanity itself.\n\u201d The statement comes from Chapter 5 \u2013 The Vacuum , which covers their position on the need for global government .\nThe quote is relatively clear ; a common enemy must be conjured in order to trick humanity into uniting under a single banner , and the elites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , as the best possible motivator .\nThey present the solution of the shared economy concept as if it is a new and bold idea .\nWhat the globalists ultimately want for their Great Reset , however , is a tidal wave reversal from freedom and individual prosperity back to a very old manner of doing things , similar to ancient feudalism .\nYou become a peasant working on land owned by the elites , or by the state , and you will never be allowed to own that land .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feudal empire

Ukraine , understanding the history of Khazaria will hopefully bring more perspective to that conflict , Dr. Sanger said .\nYou can listen to the Blurry Creatures podcast , The Khazarian Kid @ @ @ @ @

1,000,000 square miles by conquering the agrarian societies in the Caucasus region .\nThe Khazarian kingdom encompassed what is now Ukraine and parts of Eastern Europe .\nThe Rothschilds , who are

to the Nephilim Hosts ruling Ukraine today , \u201d Sanger wrote in a recent article \u2018 Khazarian Roots in Ukraine \u2019 which covers the first 50 mins or so of the Blurry Creatures podcast

demonised people are : \u2022 Nephilim are hybrids , part human and part spiritual being .\n\u2022 Nephilim Hosts are humans which partner with the spiritual forces of darkness to carry out the Nephilim agenda .\n\u2022 Demonised people are people who have demons that reside within them but they do not intentionally try to carry out the Nephilim agenda .\n\u201c So , I propose that all Nephilim Hosts are demonised but not all demonised people are Nephilim Hosts , \u201d Sanger said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Khazars it \u2019 s unfortunate we can not turn to history books because history is curiously silent about the Khazars .\nThe reason why talking about Khazars is so sensitive is because it brings up the contentious question : who are the true Jews , the true children of God ?\nA

of the experts on Khazars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who walked away from Zionism in 1945 and described the Khazars as a pagan nation and : When it comes to Ukraine and the Khazars it \u2019 s unfortunate we can

.\nOne of the experts on Khazars was Benjamin Freedman , a Zionist operative who walked away from Zionism in 1945 and described the Khazars as a pagan nation and : \u201c The vile forms of sexual excess indulged in by the Khazars as their form of religious worship produced a degree of moral degeneracy that Khazar \u2019 s king could not endure .\nIn the 7th century King Bulan\u2026 decided to abolish the practice of phallic worship\u2026and selected the future state religion as\u2026 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and practiced as \u2018 Judaism \u2019 .\n\u201d \u2013 Facts are Facts : The Truth About Khazars ( so-called Jews ) , Benjamin Freedman , 1954 , pg .\n53 Another expert is Louis Finkelstein , a Talmud scholar , who stated that Pharisee doctrines and practices , or Pharisaism , became Talmudism and : \u201c Talmudism became Medieval Rabbinism , and Medieval Rabbinism became Modern Rabbinism .\nWhen the Jew\u2026 studies the Talmud , he is actually repeating the arguments used in the Palestinian academies.\n\u201d \u2013 The Pharisees , Louis Finkelstein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matthew Johnson , a former professor of history and political science who specialised in Russian and Ukrainian history , stated in his \u2018 Defending the Khazar Thesis of the Origin of Modern Jewry \u2019 : \u201c The Khazar theory suggests there is no connection between Israelites and Jews .\nYet even if there were , the religion of the modern Jew bears no relationship whatsoever to the Israelite faith , which is vehemently condemned in the Talmud\u2026In adopting the ethic of the Talmud , they adopted the mentality of the Pharisees , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Talmud.\n\u201d This Pharisee line , to this day , actively works to destroy Christ .\nThe Nephilims influence the Nephilim Hosts though the Khazarians .\nWhen the mass conversion of Khazarians happened they implemented the Talmud , the Pharisaic teaching , in every part of society .\nEventually , the Khazarian kingdom was conquered by Genghis Kahn \u2019 s sons in the early part of the 13th century .\nThis caused a diaspora of the Khazarians , who were Ashkenazi Jews , into Eastern Europe .\nThe reign of the Khazarians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It spread into all different parts of Eastern Europe .\nIn \u2018 A Short Study of Esau-Edom in Jewry \u2019 C.F .\nParker concluded , and most historians at the time agreed , there are two categories of modern Jews : Ashkenazic Jews and Sephardic Jews .\nOne of the three elements making up Ashkenazi Jews were proselytes , or converts , including Khazarians .\nAlthough a number of scholars and historians believe Ashkenazi Jews come from Germany , there is a growing body of evidence that points to their origins as Khazaria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c The Khazar empire had a small but powerful group of Jewish bankers in Kiev as early as the 10th century.\n\u201d \u2013 The Regime : Usury , Khazaria and the American Mass , Matthew Johnson .\nThe Rothschilds were Ashkenazi Jews , Khazarians , \u201c they \u2019 re arguably the most influential Nephilim Hosts of the Common Era , \u201d Sangar said , \u201c the Rothschild family and their Khazarian mafia have gained a foothold in almost every country since the mid-1700s.\n\u201d The patriarch for the Rothschild banking dynasty is Mayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weishaupt who instituted the order of the Illuminati .\nTogether Rothschild and Weishaupt developed a seven-fold plan for world domination : \u2022 Create a one world government or a new world order This plan has become the blue print to carry out the Nephilim agenda , Sanger said , this was rolled-out , at least , by Rothschild and Weishaupt in 1776 .\nThis is essentially the play book of a Colour Revolution \u2013 destroy history , destroy the family unit .\nThis is also World Economic Forum with a dash of communism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another time , Sanger said , the Rothschilds were the treasurers for the Vatican so it filters down and does all connect .\nHow Can We Break Free from The System of Enslavement ?\n\u201c As a psychologist I am also trying to raise awareness of the mind control that has really come over our generation , \u201d Sanger said , \u201c how have we become so hoodwinked , buying the narrative hook , line and sinker ?\n\u201d It \u2019 s because of mind control tactics of the Nephilim Hosts .\nFor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukraine .\nWe have been conditioned to believe through corporate media narrative that \u201c Russia is bad.\n\u201d What has been communicated to us about war is propaganda and that has been happening for centuries , Sanger said , \u201c we \u2019 ve been consistently lied to by our media and our elected officials .\nIf we don \u2019 t do our own research and if we don \u2019 t use our critical thinking skills we just fall right into the trap.\n\u201d Orwell \u2019 s experience during the Spanish War is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during war time propaganda .\n\u2018 History stopped in 1936 \u2019 , at which he nodded in immediate understanding .\nWe were both thinking of totalitarianism in general , but more particularly of the Spanish civil war .\nEarly in life I have noticed that no event is ever correctly reported in a newspaper , but in Spain , for the first time , I saw newspaper reports which did not bear any relation to the facts , not even the relationship which is implied in an ordinary lie .\nI saw great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting , and complete silence where hundreds of men had been killed .\nI saw troops who had fought bravely denounced as cowards and traitors , and others who had never seen a shot fired hailed as the heroes of imaginary victories ; and I saw newspapers in London retailing these lies and eager intellectuals building emotional superstructures over events that had never happened .\nI saw , in fact , history being written not in terms of what happened but of what ought to have happened according to various \u2018 party lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War , George Orwell , 1943 , pg .\n11 Nephilim Hosts like to boast about their plans , for example Henry Kissinger in 1992 who said : If we think about who is currently supporting Ukraine and vilifying Russia , \u201c we \u2019 ve got D.C. swamp , mainstream media and the woke populace that loves to virtue signal , \u201d Sanger said , and \u201c we ask ourselves : are these the people that we really want to trust ?\n\u201d These are the same people who stripped us of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curve \u201d or they censored us because we were questioning \u201c the science.\n\u201d So , if we use our critical thinking skills , the narrative that is being played out for us is most likely not even accurate .\nPutin kicked the Rothschilds central bank out of Russia several years ago , Sanger said , so that tells us that he \u2019 s not part of this Cabal system .\nThe Ukraine-Russia conflict has been used to move the populace from fear of Covid to fear of nuclear war .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they want to roll out their agenda that was developed in 1776 .\nFear is the ultimate driver of mind control .\nThey want to keep us entrapped in fear because when we live in fear our ability to process nuanced information is impaired \u2013 we \u2019 re more likely to blindly follow others without using critical thinking skills .\nMost often , \u201c fear is a big fat liar \u201d and the media plays a huge role as they will roll out stories that determine whether we should think something is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of risk , for example , daily death statistics shown by corporate media heightening our perception risk from Covid .\nPsychologists refer to this tactic used by corporate media as the availability heuristic .\n\u201c Essentially \u2026 when stories are told over and over again that creates fear , then that sticks out in our head and we make decisions based on that , \u201d Sanger explained , \u201c when Nephilim Hosts can control our mind through all this fear porn that \u2019 s being put out through mainstream media , when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captured us .\nWe lose our sense of sovereignty as an individual.\n\u201d Breaking free from the system of enslavement starts with breaking free of the mind control .\nThe less you fear them , the less power they have over you .\nInstead of basing decisions on fear , seek that which combats fear \u2013 truth and love .\n\u2022 1666 And the Sabbatean Roots

San Pedro Mountains in Wyoming , came across a small cavern buried deep within the thick rock .\nWhen the dust began to settle , the prospectors made a startling discovery \u2013 the well-preserved , but long-forgotten , remains of a tiny human .\nThe origins of this little human were a mystery .\nLocal Native American tribes were known to tell stories of legendary \u201c tiny people , \u201d \u201c little spirits \u201d , or the Nimeriga .\nIn some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magical powers , or healing powers .\nIn other stories , they were a vicious tribe who attacked the Native Americans with poisoned arrows .\nThe discovery of the mummified remains drew much attention to the area , eliciting many questions , and creating controversy .\nThere were many who doubted the veracity of the prospectors \u2019 story , believing the remains to be fabricated , and the story a hoax .\nScientists flocked to the area , all with a deep desire to determine the truth behind the tiny person , nicknamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of six and \u00bd inches , and an estimated standing height of fourteen inches , it was clear that these were no ordinary remains .\nThe scientists conducted extensive testing on Pedro .\nFirst , they reviewed the outward physical evidence .\nPedro was found in a sitting position , cross-legged , on a small ledge within what appeared to be a man-made cave .\nWith bulging eyes and a flattened cranium , Pedro was extremely well preserved \u2013 so much so that even his fingernails were visible .\nA gelatinous substance covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became clear that liquids had been used to preserve the body .\nHis nose was flattened , he had a full set of teeth , and his skin was brown and wrinkled , creating the appearance of an old man .\nIn the years following the discovery of Pedro , scientists conducted more invasive testing , utilizing x-rays to try to unlock the mystery .\nSeveral anthropologists initially concluded that the remains were those of an infant , likely born prematurely , or who died shortly after birth .\nThis , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second body of scientists believe the remains to be those of an adult , possibly 16-65 years in age .\nIt has been said that x-rays revealed sharp teeth , and the presence of food in the stomach that appeared to be raw meat .\nThe x-rays also suggested that Pedro had suffered a violent death , showing broken bones , a damaged spine , and damage to the skull .\nThe discovery of the mummified remains led to significant speculation that the remains were a hoax .\nThe presence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led some to believe that the remains were actually those of a deceased infant , recovered from a medical facility , or that the prospectors had created the remains using a crude form of taxidermy .\nHowever , others maintained the remains were evidence of a Leprechaun-like race , like those mentioned in the legends of the local indigenous people , or evidence of an extra-terrestrial being .\nIt was difficult for many to fathom that a human of such tiny stature could possibly be an adult .\nWhile modern testing could provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pedro , such testing is not possible because the location of the remains has been unknown for several years .\nIt is said that the remains were put on display during sideshows in the 1940s , and were then purchased by a man named Ivan Goodman

"title": "A Study of Cultism Shows Us Why Gatekeeping Against the Far Left is a Good Thing", "content": "One of my favorite quotes of all time comes from writer and director Oliver Stone , who once said that \u201c Hell is the impossibility of reason.\n\u201d In other words , if truth and logic are eradicated within a society then any hope for redemption or peace is lost .\nThe world becomes a perpetual nightmare .\nI was reminded of this recently as I watched a documentary series called \u2018 Wild Wild Country \u2019 about the bizarre events surrounding a cult that actually tried to hijack the state of Oregon in the 1980 \u2019 s .\nI have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultism , mainly because these groups show us how easily and how far modern humanity can fall into the madness of collectivism and zealotry given the right circumstances .\nWild Wild Country is an examination of the Rajneesh cult , which was a global news phenomenon that had infiltrated the US in 1981 .\nThe movement was led spiritually by a man known as Rajneesh who would later call himself \u201c Osho.\n\u201d Osho \u2019 s religion revolved around a mish-mash of eastern philosophies and an odd political ideology in which he praised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create wealth as long as the ultimate end goal was socialism ( the forced redistribution of wealth ) .\nI was particularly struck by the number of similarities between the Rajneesh and today \u2019 s iteration of progressive social justice leftists .\nThis is not some loose association on my part ; where leftists like to falsely compare everyone that disagrees with them to \u201c Nazis \u201d in order to diminish their views and criticisms , the comparisons between them and religious cultists are so evident it \u2019 s mind boggling .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand social justice groups we must also understand how cultism works .\nHowever , I think this needs to be examined in more detail and the story of the Rajneesh is a perfect allegory .\nHow is the political left like a cult ?\nLet \u2019 s count the ways\u2026 Elitism in the Name of \u201c Equality \u201d A rather clever ploy by Osho was his praise of capitalism for the sake of socialism .\nThis allowed Osho to amass a considerable fortune by pilfering the pockets of his followers without looking hypocritical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least 93 Rolls Royces , if this gives you any indication of his personal priorities .\nWealth in the pursuit of socialism is actually a common idea among the elites .\nIn other words , it \u2019 s okay for SELECT people within a socialist/collectivist society to retain large amounts of property because they are special .\nWe have seen this most recently with leftists in the form of BLM .\nThe founders of one of the largest BLM groups have been caught on multiple occasions misappropriating donations and funds for their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the \u201c movement.\n\u201d This is not at all surprising to me , but many people who donated to the cause are now incensed to discover that BLM founders are openly drinking champagne to celebrate their \u201c victory \u201d over \u201c white supremacy \u201d while sitting in a $ 6 million mansion they secretly purchased with donation funds .\nIn every communist/socialist project in history the call is for the redistribution of wealth and power to the people but all that happens is the formation of a new elite lording over a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cults , this dynamic is justified as if the new elite is representative of a \u201c victory \u201d for equality .\nThe peasants or underlings are supposed to live vicariously through the elevation and extravagance of the leaders .\nOn the religious side , the Rajneesh movement was not at all unique .\nThey followed the same exact model as the Theosophical movement which was founded in 1875 ; slapping together various elements of misaligned religions as well as the occult into a single entity which they called a \u201c world religion.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that Rajneesh was nothing more than a rip-off or reiteration of Theosophy .\nThe goal of theosophical movements is essentially to appeal to one principle \u2013 Do what thou wilt .\nThat is to say , there are no boundaries in life and anything that creates boundaries is an unjust suppression of your \u201c true potential.\n\u201d Another factor which comes up very often in these philosophies is the idea of self worship .\nAny notion of a god or a greater design takes a back seat to the pursuit of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter the cost .\nIt is this underlying mantra of zero boundaries and the demonization of self control , discipline and responsibility that permeates cults and world religions , and not surprisingly the same attitude is ever present within social justice movements and the political left today .\nOf course , the promise of individual freedom and self exploration without restrictions is always false .\nThere tends to be far more control and oppression within cults than in most mainstream religions .\nThese movements buy followers by offering them a place to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but once they are hooked into that life , they become enslaved in other ways .\nThe vast majority of social justice arguments revolve around the worship of victimhood .\nIt is a religion of self aggrandizement through self immolation .\nActivists see themselves as living martyrs and expect to be treated as such at all times .\nBeyond that , victim status is seen as a currency that allows a person to buy attention , adoration and the right to bad behavior .\nThe more of a victim you are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want without being held responsible .\nSome of the behaviors of the Rajneesh crossed into the realm of authoritarianism and even terrorism , but the entire time the cult asserted that THEY were being attacked and victimized by the people of Oregon .\nThe Rajneesh hyperfocused on the idea that boundaries are a violation of the spiritual and emotional life of the activist or cultist .\nBut many boundaries exist for a reason ; they protect us from being assimilated into mass insanity and the crimes of madmen .\nDiscrimination in some forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperative , but leftists want to be able to do all things at all times no matter how irrational or destructive and if you say no , then you are a \u201c bigot.\n\u201d They victimize you , and then if you try to stop them , they cry out that you are victimizing them .\nLeftism is at bottom an organized cult of narcissists .\nThe story of the Rajneesh might seem bizarre without context , but if you understand the social and political ideals involved it makes perfect sense .\nThink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency of collectivists/leftists to do these four things : Invade , indoctrinate , dominate and then eradicate .\nThe cult was a relatively unknown element in the west through the 1970 \u2019 s , except within the hippie movements .\nFueled by drugs and socialist ideology , thousands of westerners were traveling to India to gain \u201c enlightenment.\n\u201d Surrounded by some of the worst poverty in the world , they would inevitably discover the Rajneesh and their extravagant garden compound .\nThe problem was that the government of India was not too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cult and investigations were underway .\nIt was not all that surprising that Osho was suddenly struck with a revelation that the cult needed to relocate to America .\nHe was facing potential prosecution for tax evasion and other crimes in India , and so he simply up and disappeared , waiting for word on the building of a new ashram in America .\nThis is where we start to see the real people in charge of the cult and why their system of belief was completely incompatible with western values .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cult , all day-to-day affairs were managed with an iron fist by an Indian woman named Ma Anand Sheela , and the power structure of the cult was rather akin to a matriarchy ( another example of why matriarchies always fail ) .\nOsho obviously had knowledge of many of the criminal enterprises underway within the cult , but was apparently more content to stay in the background when it came to worldly decisions and technical operations .\nI \u2019 ll say this about Sheela \u2013 I don \u2019 t think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of narcissistic sociopathy in my life .\nTo this day she remains adamant that she did nothing wrong and all of her actions were justified .\nThe move of the Rajneesh from India to the little town of Antelope , Oregon in 1981 was planned primarily by Sheela , who not only had a knack for sheering Osho followers for money in sophisticated ways , but also had a knack for finding and exploiting people with high level skill sets such as law , architecture and land management .\nI will admit that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to plan and execute projects with efficiency , like little worker ants .\nAnother area in which Sheela and her cohorts excelled was in marketing and branding .\nThe compound in Antelope , called \u201c Rajneeshpuram , \u201d was sold to the public as a kind of libertarian paradise where people just wanted to be free .\nThe opposite was actually true .\nAntelope , Oregon and the surrounding areas were primarily conservative at the time , and this was the real genius behind the Rajneesh relocation .\nYou see , in conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect for individual liberty and this is something we must never abandon .\nThat said , our habit of accepting people \u2019 s intentions at face value and assuming that discrimination is the same as authoritarianism sometimes gets us into trouble .\nDemocracy without skepticism and discernment is a recipe for disaster .\nHere is where I would start making more direct comparisons with the political left and their common behaviors .\nThe takeover of Antelope by the Rajneesh is a striking parable to what we are dealing with now in the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take over our country and fundamentally change it into something unrecognizable The people of Antelope were wary of the Rajneesh , but accepting of their presence .\nThere was no initial uprising of angry farmers trying to run the hippies out of the county .\nTo their credit ( or detriment ) , the conservative residents were simply resigned to keep to themselves and let the cultists be .\nThis changed when the rural area was overrun with tens of thousands of Osho \u2019 s followers and they moved to seize control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election laws which local conservatives sought to protect , the cult \u2019 s population completely overwhelmed the voting power of the small town merely by moving their people from all over the world and concentrating them in a single place .\nMany of them were foreigners with temporary visas , and Sheela advised them to commit immigration fraud through false marriages to gain citizenship .\nThe cult was rather successful in taking over the region , but faced stiff opposition and less population advantage when it came to trying to take over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase their edge in elections , Sheela ( and possibly Osho ) came up with a plan : They would offer the homeless of America safe haven in the Antelope commune .\nThey would feed , clothe and put a roof over the head of anyone who showed up off the street\u2026 but for a price .\nIn exchange , the homeless who arrived would have to vote in the county elections the way the Rajneesh wanted them to vote .\nLeftists understand that they don \u2019 t necessarily need a majority to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a majority in the RIGHT PLACES to take power .\nTheir ability to use organized mobs as a weapon to attack weak points in the structures of a particular culture is their primary survival mechanism .\nThe county responded to the obvious tactic the only way they could , which was to block all new voter registrations until an investigation into election manipulation could be completed .\nSome people would argue that this is contrary to the conservative standards of constitutionalism and free elections , but this is not the case .\nWhen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeks to use the constitutional framework as a means to destroy the constitutional framework , then gatekeeping is the only option .\nYou have to block those people from the process because their intent is malicious .\nWe see this familiar strategy within the political left as they consistently try to violate the spirit of free elections .\nThey fight ID requirements in every state that legislates them because they KNOW that a large number of votes for the left come from illegal immigration , and if people have to prove they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loses a potential edge .\nBy extension , leftists aggressively fight for the permanent use of mail-in ballots for the same reason .\nFraud is much easier with such ballots and no proof of citizenship is required in most cases .\nFurthermore , the exploitation of the poor is a pervasive tactic among cults and among leftists .\nThey pretend to care about the struggles of the downtrodden , but in the end all they are really after is power and they will happily use the poor as cannon fodder to get that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Insanity With mounting investigations into the practices of the cult and county and state officials considering a move to obstruct the operations of Rajneeshpuram , Osho , Sheela and the cult were getting increasingly desperate .\nWinning local elections was now a priority for them .\nTheir solution to the problem was to start a hidden lab on compound grounds with the purpose of developing biological weapons .\nThe plan was to poison as many residents of the county as possible with Salmonella planted in multiple restaurants and buffets using hidden spray canisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have to stay home from sickness that the elections could be manipulated in favor of the cult .\nThe scheme failed , but over 751 people suffered from food poisoning that week in 1984 .\nEverything was justified as a means to an end .\nLeaked film footage of some of the \u201c therapy sessions \u201d within the compound gave the public a startling view into what happens when you build a society around the removal of boundaries and the lack of consequences for engaging in excess .\nThe film contained images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully naked and wailing , raging , kicking and punching each other , then running about wildly before the men began raping some of the women .\nThis turned into a grotesque orgy , which was then followed by insane singing and disco dancing .\nIt sounds darkly hilarious in a way , like it \u2019 s all a joke , but watching it I find that I lose my sense of humor .\nIt \u2019 s really not funny when you actually see complete and utter madness on full display in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say \u201c that \u2019 s enough , time to stop.\n\u201d Unbridled emotional aggression is what we tend to expect from unbalanced children , not full grown adults .\nAnd sexual addiction has always been a taboo in the US exactly because we understand that this leads to many other problems in society including the destruction of healthy families , the core pillar of any civilization worth a damn .\nIt also tends to lead to the sexualization of children , which is always an indicator of a culture in steep decline .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cult and it \u2019 s one that the documentary series decided not to mention .\nThe Rajneesh were very proud of their free love society , but rarely talked about many of the dangers associated with it .\nBirth control and even abortion were often enforced within the cult , and relationships and marriages rarely survived .\nFurthermore , the encouragement of unchecked emotion as if it is an \u201c act of purity \u201d can lead to delusions of victimhood and justifications for criminality .\nI can \u2019 t think of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penchant for emotional outbursts bordering on the schizophrenic , and all of this stemming from an ideology which promotes personal excess .\nBy extension , they view any words or actions that make light of their emotions or that are critical of their excesses as the same as physical violence .\nMeaning , words are the same as sticks and stones , and reacting to words with violence is therefore acceptable .\nI won \u2019 t get into the internal split within the Rajneesh and all the drama that ensued .\nNeedless to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat their own .\nOsho was eventually booted out of the US for immigration fraud ( among other things ) while Sheela and a few others were arrested for a variety of crimes including attempted murder .\nSheela was unfortunately given a short sentence of a few years while her minions spent far longer in prison .\nTo this day , many of the

"content": "I think one of the great misconceptions about economic crisis is that solutions are always dependent on centralized government action .\nIn truth , most financial disasters are actually caused by too much government action and involvement .\nCentral banks like the Federal Reserve are also primary culprits ; as I outlined in last week \u2019 s article their machinations , which are independent of government oversight , fall into the category of deliberate sabotage .\nThe Fed bankrolls corruption through fiat money creation while government officials and corporations utilize that money to wreak havoc on our living standards .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ money problem , but there \u2019 s still a host of agenda driven politicians and bureaucrats to deal with before our nation can right the ship .\nOne clear way to fix our system would be to first force government to interfere less .\nAs a point of reference , consider the common media narratives surrounding the covid pandemic .\nAlong with the White House the media has been the premier driver of irrational fear over the spread of covid , which ended up being a minor threat compared to the hype as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more that 0.27 % .\nYet , in response to a virus that was a mortal danger to less than one-thrid of 1 % of the population , bureaucrats declared a national emergency requiring insane and unconstitutional lockdowns .\nThe lockdowns damaged the economy in ways people are only now beginning to comprehend , with hundred of thousands of small businesses lost across the country .\nNot only that , but the establishment responded to the economic implosion they created by printing over $ 6 trillion in new money through the Fed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beta test for UBI ( Universal Basic Income ) has expedited a stagflationary disaster and helped to push prices on necessities to 40 year highs ( the official number ) .\nThe media claims it is \u201c covid that is causing the crash , \u201d but this is a lie .\nIt was the RESPONSE to covid that is causing the crash .\nThe virus was incidental to the economic sabotage initiated by governments and central banks .\nAs we saw in conservative red states that defied the lockdowns and the vax mandates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states suffered .\nAnd what did these blue states get in return for their economic sacrifices ?\nNothing .\nCovid infections continued to rage in blue states and deaths often outpaced red states with similar sized populations .\nIn other words , the lockdowns , the mask mandates and the attempts force vaccinations through medical tyranny saved ZERO lives and possibly made things worse .\nThis is the legacy of government micro-management ( And yes , let \u2019 s not forget that Trump went along with these lockdowns in the beginning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt-bag that continued the measures despite the massive amount of evidence that they don \u2019 t work ) .\nWhile the covid event illustrates my point in a big way , there are a lot of deeply rooted problems that government intervention has caused that add up to one big fiscal calamity .\nMany of these threats require a basic but sweeping return to fundamentals that government elites will rarely address and will try to stop at all costs .\nHere are just a few examples\u2026 Inflation And Stagflation ?\nBack The Dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their minions have spent the better part of a century trying to convince the public that a gold standard for our currency is what caused the Great Depression and what could cause future depressions .\nThey claim that limitations on money printing strangle liquidity and disrupt velocity .\nThis is a lie .\nFormer fed chairman Ben Bernanke openly admitted in 2002 in a speech in honor of Milton Friedman that it was the CENTRAL BANK that actually caused the deflationary collapse of the 1930s , not the existence of the gold standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fed official was perhaps due to the sheer amount of evidence that Friedman often cited that contradicted the original anti-gold propaganda .\nOr maybe it happened because the banking elites did not see Friedman as a particular threat , and figured no one among the public would read Bernanke \u2019 s speech anyway .\nIn fact , a commodities foundation held the American economy together for centuries until the Fed came along and the government slowly began removing gold from the picture .\nAll subsequent economic crisis events have been exponentially worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is employed , stability always follows .\nJust look at what has happened in Russia recently ; their currency was on a downward spiral due to international sanctions , yet , when they reopened markets this past week the Ruble skyrocketed back to normal .\nWhy ?\nBecause Putin had the currency coupled to gold .\nIt \u2019 s really that simple .\nRelated article : Russia \u2019 s Gold & Near-Zero Debt Give it Best Chance of Thriving in a Financial Crisis .\nThe US and parts of Europe are facing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the unchecked avarice of central bank stimulus and government spending .\nThe ONLY way to secure the dollar \u2019 s existence as a stable store of wealth would be to back it with hard commodities like precious metals ( among others ) .\nThis might kill the dollar \u2019 s world reserve status because fiat printing would be impossible from that point on , but I got a news flash for those that hate the idea of grounding the dollar in commodities : We \u2019 re going to lose world reserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to happen soon .\nOne third of the world \u2019 s population including Russia , China and India are already breaking from the dollar in bilateral trade .\nThe US might as well accept this is the reality and prepare to mitigate the coming currency collapse by supporting the dollar with commodities .\nAlso read : Ukraine and the Rothschild \u2018 Financial Vultures \u2019 Family .\nIn early February of this year the Biden Administration made legal filings which halted new oil and gas leases including exploration due to conflicts over \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s oil independence is only one of many instances starting with Biden \u2019 s sabotage of the Keystone Pipeline in 2021 .\nInterestingly , with gas prices doubling ever since Biden entered office , the White House now claims that they have nothing to do with energy inflation and are not preventing drilling in the US .\nDuring the same period Russia was establishing a decades long oil and gas contract with China and laying the groundwork for a major pipeline to be finished by 2025 .\nAnd yes , China DOES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India to absorb most of the oil and gas that might be shunned by Europe should they follow through with energy sanctions .\nRussia was planning ahead while the US was shifting from energy independence and net exporter status to once again becoming dependent on authoritarian regimes in the Arab world .\nWhy ?\nBiden \u2019 s excuse is usually climate alarmism .\nThe Earth \u2019 s temperature has only risen by ONE DEGREE CELSIUS in the past 100 years according to the NOAA , so the main argument against oil production in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that man-made carbon has any bearing whatsoever on climate changes .\nBut maybe the carbon fraud is just a distraction from something else ?\nTo fix any supply and demand issues in the US , we only need to start producing once again at levels which were easily obtainable in 2020 .\nBut what if the issue of supply contraction is not the main cause of oil inflation ?\nI would note that the dollar is not only the world reserve currency but also the global petro-currency .\nUntil recently , almost all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The decline or collapse of the dollar \u2019 s buying power due to money printing and runaway inflation is more likely the direct cause of rising oil prices , and supply issues are secondary .\nIf the dollar was about to collapse due to inflation , oil would be one of the first early warning indicators .\nWith the establishment blocking new oil production and hindering the most cost effective method for oil transport ( pipelines ) , an engineered decline in supply becomes a very effective smokescreen for the death of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government and the Federal Reserve \u2019 s currency destruction could then be blamed on supply chain issues and climate \u201c peril.\n\u201d This is the reason why the establishment will not allow any future growth in US oil production .\nThey can not allow the public to realize the precarious position our currency is in .\nThere are a lot of reasons why manufacturing has left the US , from greedy and corrupt labor unions driving up wages to higher taxes and land costs to extremely cheap shipping from overseas exporters .\nThere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were outsourced to places like China in order to deliberately force the public into a global interdependency scheme .\nIn other words were are stuck with the supply chain we have , not because it \u2019 s the best system , but because the globalists want it that way .\nIt \u2019 s unlikely that the federal government and the elitist establishment would ever allow real manufacturing to come back to the US in a way that would make us more self sufficient .\nAs long as our country relies on outsourced goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain beholden to the global chain for our survival .\nBeing completely independent might be impossible , but we could be producing far more domestically than we are today .\nState governments could create incentives to manufacture within their borders by removing property taxes , reducing state taxes and protecting businesses from certain federal obstructions such as carbon restrictions .\nAs long as those companies do not support anti-freedom initiatives with the money they make , they should be aided so that real jobs and real production make a comeback in the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states want to survive the coming financial crisis that is about to strike , they are going to have to start ignoring federal restrictions on land use and the production of raw materials ( like oil or coal ) .\nSome environmental rules are good , but some are pointless and are only designed to control rather than protect .\nStates will have to stand in defiance of these rules if anything is going to change for the better .\nDebt And Liquidity Crisis ?\nLet States Establish Their Own Banks And Currencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting model for economic independence , which utilizes a state sponsored bank designed specifically to help businesses in ND .\nI would say it \u2019 s bizarre that this idea has not become popular across the nation , but I understand that if it did the federal government and the central bankers would be very unhappy .\nHere \u2019 s the thing , while it is true that the constitution explicitly states that the US Treasury be the only issuer of US currency , this was done at a time when our currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no corrupt middleman in the form of a central bank .\nIn truth , the Treasury is now second fiddle to the Federal Reserve , and the constitutional regulations on money have already been broken .\nIt \u2019 s time for a new currency model and new banking model .\nAn official bank in each state could decentralize power away from the Federal Reserve in terms of how debt and interest rates are handled , creating something closer to free market discovery of interest rates rather than a rate dictatorship control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each state could also issue currency scrip legal for use only within the borders of those states .\nThis would create a secondary safety net against inflation in the dollar .\nIn other words , we decentralize the banking system and we offer state alternatives which function not so much as competing currencies but as parallel or complementary currencies backed by and exchangeable in certain commodities .\nI believe very strongly that this model ( along with a couple dozen other measures I don \u2019 t have space to cover here ) could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mismanagement and bring us back from the brink of inflation and debt catastrophe .\nStates could do this without the permission of the federal government or the Federal Reserve , but I have little doubt that the elites would be in an uproar .\nMake no mistake , states will have to move to decouple from the national financial system and build alternatives as soon as they realize that the dollar is tanking and stagflation is here to stay .\nAnd when they do , the establishment will declare such actions on par @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are numerous preparations each individual can make in their local communities to insulate themselves from economic dangers .\nThere are those that will say that local measures are only a stop gap and more national action needs to be taken .\nThey are partially correct ; in the long run there needs to be wider organization towards free markets once again , along with redundancies in state economies .\nIn the short term we must do what we can .\nUltimately , the most clear solutions to our fiscal fate are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WANT to save the economy , at least not in a way that ends up with them having less power .\nThey want even more power and centralization that extends beyond national boundaries into the realm of global management .\nFixing the system can \u2019 t happen because they won \u2019 t let it happen .\nThis means that the fix that will save us in the long run will be the one that allows all others to progress ; and that fix is to remove these people from positions of influence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repair the body in the wake of an illness until the offending disease is eliminated .\nFor now , all we can do is keep the country on life support until a cure is applied .\nBy Brandon Smith , Guest writer / You can contact Brandon Smith at : [ email protected ]", "author": "HAF", "url":

Ukraine .\nThe program \u2019 s researchers were looking into the most deadly viruses \u2013 potential biological weapons agents \u2013 that have geographical focuses in both Ukraine and Russia .\nThey were also looking into the methods in which these pathogens spread diseases .\nBecause of the scope of the project , it is clear that a significant portion , if not the majority , of the knowledge about the American military program is kept hidden from the rest of the world .\nOn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland told the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations that Washington was attempting to block the transfer of some scientific materials from Ukrainian bio-laboratories to Russian forces .\nIgor Kirillov , Chief of the Russian Armed Forces

clarifies its military biological collaboration with Ukraine ?\nMaria Zakharova : Russia has publicly revealed the factual information that have come to the forefront so far at the UN and other international organizations , and has called on the US officials to deliver clear explanations , but Washington , unsurprisingly , appears unwilling to reveal any purposeful data with the public about its military biological program in Ukraine .\nFurthermore , clearly believing that offense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House has initiated yet another propaganda campaign based on the false claim that Russia \u2019 s attempts to draw international attention to the actions of US military biologists in Ukraine are nothing but a smoke screen that Moscow will seek to use to conceal up any potential use of biological or chemical weapons during the special military operation .\nThis clumsy attempt by the US to shift public attention away from the critically combustible topic of US-controlled biological facilities in Ukraine by drowning it in this \u201c apocalyptic sensation \u201d was surprisingly backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German politicians and bureaucrats , including Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz , have issued statements that echo the US narrative by issuing righteous threats and warnings directed against Russia .\nBerlin \u2019 s formal preemptive verbal position in the sense of the Ukraine crisis is consistent with the strategy it has followed for a long time in the context of the crisis ( which is not helping to resolve it now and previously led the Minsk process to a stalemate with its deliberate pro-Kiev slant ) , but it stands out in its outright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propaganda that has been coming from Germany in recent weeks .\nFirst and foremost , given the critical condition that , even before the Russian Armed Forces began this special military operation , Germany and the US had been conducting strong military biological activities in Ukraine for many years and may still be doing so .\nWe are certain that this is essentially what drives Germany to be more active than other EU nations in attempting to link our country to criminal schemes involving the deployment of biological and chemical weapons in Ukraine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s republics .\nQuestion : Is there any more information available about Germany \u2019 s military biological actions in Ukraine ?\nMaria Zakharova : The following points can help you better grasp the situation .\nThe German Government has been enacting the German Biosecurity Programme ( GBP ) since 2013 , under the auspices of the German Federal Foreign Office , that also involves partnership projects with government agencies and research organizations in focus countries , which Ukraine joined in 2014 , the year of Maidan .\nGerman experts from the German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , the Friedrich Loeffler Institute ( Greifswald-Riems Island ) , the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine ( Hamburg ) , and the Robert Koch Institute ( Berlin ) , all of which specialize in lethal biological agent research , are involved in practical activities .\nThe third stage of the GBP will be executed in 2020-2022 , per the German Federal Foreign Office .\nFrom the publicly available sources , we can deduce that the GBP \u2019 s declared technological objectives comprise , among other things , acquiring epidemic intelligence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology , and developing partner countries \u2019 infrastructure for handling harmful biological agents .\nAccording to its own records , the Institute of Experimental and Clinical Veterinary Medicine in Kharkov has become the major Ukrainian counterpart of the German Armed Forces \u2019 Institute of Microbiology since 2016 .\nUnder the Ukrainian-German initiative \u201c Initiative on Biological Safety and Biological Defense in the Management of the Zoonotic Risks at the Outer Borders of the European Union , \u201d the two institutes collaborate .\nThe notion that its stated objective is to \u201c improve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukraine , \u201c particularly in the east of the country \u201d raises the rhetorical query of which boundary the German military scientists deem an outside boundary for their professional interests .\nIs it the border between Russia and Ukraine ?\nIn its materials , the Institute of Microbiology states that the initiative is linked to the \u201c potential threat of biological terrorism \u201d in Ukraine , despite the country \u2019 s ongoing hostilities in its eastern areas .\nThis is clearly a manner of sending a subliminal message about the DPR and LPR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing plans to employ globally forbidden biological weapons .\nThe German military has been intentionally intimidating their Ukrainian colleagues for a long time , psychologically pushing them against the Donbass republics in the process .\nUkrainian biological safety experts are constantly present at the Institute of Microbiology of the German Armed Forces \u2019 medical biodefense conferences , which are held on a regular basis .\nTo ensure security against a prospective biological attack , it is clear that the potential biological agents with which it can be made must first be studied .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the subject of biological or chemical weapons is required .\nThe German Armed Forces ( AFG ) have sufficient knowledge and actual competence in this field , as the notorious incident with the inexplicable poisoning of blogger Alexey Navalny revealed .\nSpecialists from the AFG Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology \u2013 a military institute affiliated with the AFG Institute of Microbiology \u2013 allegedly found evidence of a military toxin belonging to the Novichok group in the body of a Russian citizen extremely rapidly .\nSuch a high level of knowledge \u2013 assuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows that the AFG is capable of synthesizing dangerous compounds on its own , including the infamous Novichok and its marks .\nOn the Baltic Island of Riems , Germany \u2019 s Friedrich Loeffler Institute , which is in control of the center for the study of the most risky viruses and zoonotic infections , retains visible collaboration with the Ukrainian State Research Institute of Laboratory Diagnostics and Veterinary-Sanitary Expertise ( Kiev ) , the State Scientific Control Institute of Bio-Technology and Strains of Microorganisms ( Kiev ) and also with the Institute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kharkov ) which collaborates in conjuncture with the AFG Institute of Microbiology .\nThe Friedrich Loeffler Institute in Ukraine has been studying Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever .\nIn 1944 , Soviet scientists detected it for the first time on the Russian Crimean peninsula .\nThe institute tasked its Ukrainian colleagues to take samples of ectoparasite recipients of bats that were moved to the aforementioned Reims Island per established arrangements , according to documented proof .\nIn Ukraine , the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine has focused its efforts on the most deadly fevers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nile , and Usutu , to mention a few .\nThis list of Germany \u2019 s bio-military efforts in Ukraine is by no means complete .\nIt is not impossible that the Russian Armed Forces would uncover more documents as the special military operation develops .\nAccording to verifiable accounts , Germany \u2019 s efforts on biological security was tightly linked with its American allies , who set up a network of at least 30 biological laboratories in Ukraine .\nThey were active in perilous studies in addition to their other interests .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ false information regarding our country \u2019 s plans to employ weapons that are prohibited by international law .\nWe feel that such declarations will only encourage neo-Nazi battalions to carry out horrific provocations , and that Berlin will have moral responsibility for the sad consequences .", "author": "HAF", "url":

numerous creative minds have attempted to come up with solutions that would make the world a better place .\nNikola Tesla was one such individual whose ambitions benefited humanity .\nThen there \u2019 s the story of Baltimore engineer Otis T. Carr , who was a devout believer in Tesla \u2019 s concept of free energy .\nHowever , at the moment , a relatively unknown brilliant mind is that of inventor John Searl , who is reported to have created his own \u201c flying machine \u201d ( antigravity ) and devised a technique for generating clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Roy Robert Searl was born on May 2 , 1932 , in Wantage , England .\nBetween 1946 and 1956 , Searl claimed to have created and built the \u201c Searl Effect Generator \u201d ( SEG ) , variably described as anti-gravity and perpetual motion technology .\nSearl spent over 60 years working to offer humanity his free energy method in order to liberate the globe from carbon-emitting fuel .\nHe worked as an apprentice at BR Rewinds in London \u2019 s Grays Inn Road .\nThere he obtained permission to manufacture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilities and technical resources .\nHe stated that in December 1946 , he completed the generator in his apartment at 30 Crawley Rd , Haringey , London , UK , using all magnetic components fabricated to his specifications .\nThe original prototypes generated electricity , but they also created unusually high voltage and gravitomagnetism , which resulted in the initial devices being destroyed during testing due to a significant anti-gravity effect .\nRegrettably , there is no independent confirmation of these assertions .\nThe Searl Effect Generator ( SEG ) operates similarly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it is built around a circular track that allows the continuous motion of movable rotors .\nIt is a magnetic prime mover comprised of electromagnetic multi-phased cylindrical rollers mounted on stationary stator rings that are completely free of mechanical wear and friction .\nThe Searl generator is constructed entirely of rare earth elements ( neodymium ) and features an intricate structure .\nThe energy is multiplied due to the structure of the magnetic field created by the moving parts .\nA precisely designed magnetic field is the linking element in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a critical component .\nUnlike the physically visible blocks of any other motor , the magnetic field organizes the motor in a simpler and more nuanced manner .\nThis significantly improves the device \u2019 s efficiency and results in unique effects .\nBetween 1946 and 1968 , the Searl Effect was referred to as magnetic bubbles in motion , as Searl \u2019 s early newsletters stated .\nIn 1968 , it became obvious that these magnetic bubbles included particles in a predictable manner and that the number of bubbles present in the material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of this discovery , Searl rejected the term magnetic bubbles \u2019 in favor of magnetic quantum material \u2019 and published the specifics in a newsletter that was later reprinted in one of Searl \u2019 s books .\nAdditionally , a laboratory examination confirms that the material changes its state in some way when created in this method .\nWhen the rollers are brought into close proximity to the SEG plate , the machine \u2019 s resonant magnetic field attracts and accelerates electrons .\nThis process is aided by the neodymium layer \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe SEG \u2019 s unique mechanical and material configuration pulses the neodymium , releasing and replacing extra electrons that provide mechanical and electrical power .\nThe demonstration is shown in the video embedded below .\nApart from its groundbreaking work on free energy generators and electric motors , Searl invented the Inverse Gravity Vehicle ( IGV ) .\nThe IGV , which is powered by SEG technology , is a craft capable of lifting and defying gravity ; it is a flying machine that receives and transforms energy from its surrounding environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does the Searl Effect Truly Exist ?\nIn the mid-1990s , Russian academics Vladimir Roshchin and Serge Godin constructed and tested their own version of Searl \u2019 s disc , dubbed the Magnetic Energy Converter , or MEC .\nTheir prototype was one meter in diameter and featured a starter motor and brake system .\nTheir studies suggested that as the rotor speed exceeded approximately 200 rpm , the MEC began to self-power , with the drive motor consuming less energy as a result .\nWhen the rotor reached 550 revolutions per minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began providing output power , producing 7 kilowatts at a rotor speed of 595 revolutions per minute .\nAdditionally , they noticed that the rotor began to lose weight after it exceeded 550 revolutions per minute .\nAt 595 revolutions per minute , it was noted that the entire apparatus had shed 35 % of its weight .\nThe device was not tested at speeds greater than 595 rpm for fear of exceeding the mechanical design \u2019 s limits .\nTheir initial prototype has supposedly been stolen

\u2019 that Jesus Christ rose from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary story of the heart of Christianity .\nLong story short , the documentary questions the life of Jesus and asks numerous controversial questions life , was Jesus excommunicated , and did he flee to the Himalayas ?\nAccording to the documentary , Jesus spent years teaching in various , distant holy cities like Jagannath , Rajagriha and Benares , and that He eventually fled to the Himalayas , where He continued his studies in Buddhism .\nMany authors , including a German scholar by the name of Holger Kersten wrote about Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @

.\nApart from the generic allusion that Jesus was advancing in wisdom , stature , and in the favor of God and man ( Luke 2:52 ) , the Bible says nothing more about the life of Jesus during this period

technology that they were already studying in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own top-secret aircraft .\nYes , Jessup suspected that many ( if not most ) of the UFOs seen by eyewitnesses were actually US warships , and anti-gravity technologies were once involved , including in the famous project with the Eldridge ship ( Philadelphia experiment in 1943 ) .\nJessup became deeply concerned about being watched and , in

thoroughly searched everything .\nSuspicions increased when Jessup was contacted by the US Navy and openly asked to tell them about his book and the anti-gravity technology described in it .\nAnd when Jessup started talking to them , they asked him to tell them what Jessup knew about the Philadelphia Experiment .\nThe Philadelphia experiment or the experiment with Eldridge is not recognized as a proven fact but is considered a simple tale , however , in UFO sources it is called completely real and provides a lot of indirect evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top-secret program designed to use electromagnetic fields to make warships visually invisible to the enemy .\nThe USS Eldridge was chosen as the object of the experiment , but during the test in 1943 something went wrong and the ship physically disappeared .\nWhen it reappeared , some of its crew were dead , some were injured , and some had gone mad .\nThere are also stories that some of the crew simply disappeared from the ship and were never seen again .\nJessup was very horrified by the Eldridge question and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it , getting a response they seemed to be satisfied .\nPerhaps they just wanted to know if Jessup had gotten more information about this experiment than had been leaked so far .\nJessup was already in a state of deep fear and paranoia , and this visit only added to his anxieties .\nAnd then he began to notice people in black suits [ i.e .\nthe infamous Men in Black ] who were hiding in the shadows of neighboring houses , and the letters and items that he found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened and resealed .\nEvery day Morris Jessup became more and more nervous and irritated , and it ended on the evening of April 20 , 1959 , when his lifeless body was found in his own car , which was parked in

unexpectedly joyful and high spirits : he spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone with his old friend Manson Valentine , expressing enthusiasm for his latest work and plans for further research .\nJessup even

Clearly , the system\u2026 is not sustainable , \u201d began Nicole Schwab , speaking at an InTent roundtable .\n\u201c So , I see it as a tremendous opportunity to really have this Great Reset and to use these huge flows of money , to use the increased levers that policymakers have today in a way that was not possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not incremental , but that we can look back and we can say , \u2018 This is the moment where we really started to position nature at the core of the economy.\n\u2019 \u201d Schwab continues , saying that politicians and businesses have the opportunity to redesign the economies of the world with nature and \u201c regenerative agriculture \u201d in mind before pivoting into a discussion about \u201c engaging youth \u201d with climate change propaganda to create a \u201c restoration generation \u201d ( i.e.\n, indoctrinating an entire generation ) .\n\u201c And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also around engaging youth , \u201d Schwab continues .\n\u201c And , for

ourselves as a restoration generation ?\n\u201d \u201c I think that \u2019 s where we need to go .\nI \u2019 m also hopeful that it \u2019 s possible , but I think it will take a lot of will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the business actors , to break with business as usual\u2026 And this is about risk , and it \u2019 s about risk , and it \u2019 s about resilience because the shocks coming are going to be even worse if we don \u2019 t do it now.\n\u201d It appears the apple doesn \u2019 t fall far from the tree : Now That COVID is Ending , Klaus Schwab Launched the \u2018 Great Narrative \u2019 and It \u2019 s About Global Warming ( Just Like We Warned ) .\nNicole \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken and written on redesigning society with climate policies at the fore .\nIn a WEF article entitled \u201c Now is the time for a \u2018 great reset , \u2019 \u201d Schwab senior lays out the three key components of the Great Reset , second of which is \u201c equality and sustainability.\n\u201d \u201c The second component of a Great Reset agenda would ensure that investments advance shared goals , such as equality and sustainability\u2026 Rather than using these funds\u2026 to fill cracks in the old system , we should use them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resilient , equitable , and sustainable in the long run .\nThis means , for example , building \u201c green \u201d urban infrastructure and creating incentives for industries to improve their track record on environmental , social , and governance ( ESG ) metrics , \u201d writes Schwab .\nThe environmental , social , and governance ( ESG ) metrics that Schwab mentions sound benign but are truly radical : As part of their ESG metrics and international dietary framework , the United Nations recommends that red meat consumption be reduced to 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per person in the name of sustainability and \u2018 saving the world.\n\u2019 According to the \u201c 8 predictions for the world in 2030 , \u201d meat will be \u201c an occasional treat , not a staple , for the good of the environment and our health \u201d .\nFor this agenda to work , they will have to find alternative protein sources , since most people will be living in megacities where they will not be able to grow their own food , so that \u2019 s why these globalist sickos are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mainstream media .\nYou can read more on the subject HERE .\nClimate change education [ i.e .\nindoctrination ] , as mentioned by Nicole Schwab , is another crucial ESG metric in the overall agenda .\nAnother all-encompassing policy of the UN \u2019 s ESGs that \u2019 s become increasingly noticeable and disastrous in countries like Canada is a carbon tax on practically everything from food to gas to heating to private businesses that don \u2019 t conform to the new normal , which will lead to pricing the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private transportation and consumption of meat products .", "author": "HAF", "url":

Benefits and How Much Time is Left?", "content": "I have been warning about an inevitable East vs. West economic war for many years now .\nThe question was never a matter of likelihood , it was always just a matter of timing .\nWhen would the most convenient time be for World War III ?\nThe issue of \u201c convenience \u201d might sound odd , but I want readers to remember one rule : All wars are banker wars .\nThere is nothing you can not eventually understand in terms of geopolitics as long as you accept the fact that international conflicts are generally engineered and always designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power brokers and financial elites .\nIf you are one of those people who assume all of these events are merely \u201c random and unfortunate coincidence \u201d then you \u2019 ll remain in the dark for the rest of your life \u2013 and will never grasp why terrible things are happening to you as the world falls apart .\nYou will go to an early grave because you were unprepared while still thinking you were the smartest person in the room .\nIn my article Order out of Chaos : How the Ukraine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I outlined the many factors that tie the Kremlin to globalist institutions like the World Economic Forum ( WEF ) , the Bank of International Settlements ( BIS ) , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , elitists like Henry Kissinger and international banks like Goldman Sachs .\nThe reality is , Russia has long been attached to globalist interests and this is not going to change because of the war in Ukraine , just as it did not change after Russia annexed Crimea .\nChina is , of course , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ globalist institutions .\nThe nation accrued trillions of dollars in debt because this is a prerequisite for joining the IMF \u2019 s Special Drawing Rights ( SDR ) basket of currencies .\nYes , China went from being a nation of minimal debt to being trillions in the red just because the IMF demands \u201c liquidity \u201d for a nation \u2019 s currency to be considered viable for their global centralization initiative .\nThis is not the behavior of a country that is anti-globalist .\nI \u2019 m not going to continue rehashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attachments to the globalists here .\nI \u2019 ve already done that for well over a decade and frankly I grow tired of having to rehash the lessons that brilliant researchers like Antony Sutton expertly addressed back before I was born .\nIf there \u2019 s a major war , then there are globalists behind it influencing both sides and seeking to gain more power .\nIf you haven \u2019 t figured this out by now , then you never will .\nHere \u2019 s what war is good for Why engineer a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both sides of a chess game , you always end up the winner .\nBeyond that , chaos is the ultimate recipe for advancing draconian agendas that the public would never allow to pass during peacetime .\nWhat I want to examine here instead is the issue of timing and development ; how is this massive economic war going to play out and how long will it take to happen ?\nOnce we understand the stages , maybe we can brace for impact and take actions to change the outcome .\nThe first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the court of eastern nations and that their actions will dictate the pace of events .\nThe economic lesson the West has forgotten True wealth has nothing to do with money or debt creation ; true wealth comes from resources , the means of production and labor .\nThis is something the Marxists actually got right in their philosophy ; the problem is that Marxists are only interested in ways to steal labor , resources and production while making the public think that such theft is a good thing .\nEastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is .\nYou can have all the money in the world but if you have no manufacturing base or resource development then you have nothing .\nIt \u2019 s as simple as that .\nIf a nation has no real wealth and no means of creating it , no printing press is going to save its economy .\nThe West has abandoned much of its means of production and has crippled the exploration of its own resources through fake environmental concerns like \u201c carbon pollution.\n\u201d The East has not done this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affects long term productivity .\nTherefore , the East is in the strongest position to survive a global economic conflict .\nBut the real key to the progression of an economic world war is the combination of countries involved and their trade agreements .\nRussia and China , for example , have been developing bilateral trade meant to cut out the U.S. dollar for many years now .\nRussia is resource-rich , and China has the world \u2019 s largest manufacturing and export base .\nAn alliance makes perfect economic sense .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only weeks before the invasion of Ukraine , Russia signed a 30-year oil and gas contract with China worth hundreds of billions of dollars .\nThis deal coincides with the construction of a major pipeline from Russia to China which will be completed by 2025 .\nIndia also made arrangements for increased oil shipments from Russia , and will pay without the dollar ( formerly the world \u2019 s sole petro-currency ) .\nFurthermore , the promise of lower prices while the rest of the oil world is experiencing rapid inflation in energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil , natural gas or coal from Russia .\nThe other nations of the BRICS bloc ( Brazil , India , China and South Africa ) have all been highly active in trade with Russia despite western sanctions and the removal of Russian banks from the SWIFT international payments network .\nThis is exactly what I predicted would happen many years ago .\nBut how does this trading bloc affect the time frame of the world war ?\nIt has been my belief that the real target of this war is not Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the American economy .\nYes , there will be far reaching financial consequences beyond the U.S. , but our economy is the only economy that is completely reliant on our currency \u2019 s global reserve status .\nA world war using economic weapons and tactics is the worst type of war we could fight because it is not a war we can win .\nThe dollar \u2019 s global reserve status is our Achilles heel .\nIt is not a strength , but a weakness .\nWhile all eyes are on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the planet , very few realize that the worst damage is going to hit us right here at home .\nThe sanctions on Russia are only a part of the problem , as this is creating momentum towards a general decoupling from the dollar trade .\nThe bigger issue is the BRICS nations ( and their export/import partners ) who will refuse to accept sanctions because they are economically dependent on each other .\nOne example is the recent announcement by Hungary that they plan to refuse any cuts to Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because this would cause an energy crisis in their country , one they couldn \u2019 t recover from .\nMany other nations are following this logic around the world , and if NATO is going to continue pushing for economic isolation of Russia , then those countries will invariably stop using the dollar as their reserve currency .\nWhy \u201c invariably , \u201d you might ask \u2013 why does Russia \u2019 s economic isolation lead to the end of the dollar \u2019 s global reserve status ?\nHere \u2019 s why : when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( EU ) sanctioned Russia , they also froze Russia \u2019 s U.S. dollar accounts and terminated Russia \u2019 s connection with the international payments platform .\nThis was a very clear method of coercion !\nIt \u2019 s as though Biden called up Putin and told him , \u201c Get out of Ukraine or else .\nThat \u2019 s a real nice economy you got there .\nBe a shame if something , ah , happened to it\u2026 \u201d The rest of the world watched the West financially cancel Russia with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act of economic warfare revealed a nearly-unthinkable conclusion : If they did it to Russia , they could do it to us , too\u2026 \u2026wars tend to turn into major junctures for global currencies , and with Russia losing access to its foreign currency reserves , a message has been sent to all countries that they can \u2019 t count on these money stashes to actually be theirs in the event of tension .\nAs such , it may make less and less sense for global reserve managers to hold dollars for safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away right when they \u2019 re most needed .\nDylan Grice of Calderwood Capital put this in more stark terms : In other words , the establishment elites in the US and Europe are creating the conditions which can destroy the dollar .\nThe dollar \u2019 s status is entirely dependent on faith and belief in its demand .\nIf demand for dollars wavers because of global sanctions , then all those trillions of greenbacks held in overseas banks will come flooding back into the U.S. , shoving the nation deeper into stagflationary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this will be the consequence .\nIn fact , they \u2019 re counting on it .\nWe have eight years to prepare The year 2030 is consistently mentioned by the United Nations , the IMF , the WEF and the rest of the cabal of globalist institutions as the final milestone for their Great Reset agenda .\nIf a global economic crisis is the catalyst as it appears to be , then several years would be required to let the collapse play out \u2013 along with the introduction of a \u201c solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the economic war will have to accelerate quickly going into the next year .\nToday we are already seeing 40 year highs in inflation , along with considerable supply chain disruptions .\nMultiple globalist foundations are \u201c predicting \u201d food shortages around the world in the next 3-6 months .\nI believe the war itself will expand rapidly within a year to include China , and most of the damage will be done by the end of 2024 .\nThis will all depend on how fast exporters ( mainly China ) dump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the primary trigger .\nA significant part of the WEF \u2019 s Great Reset agenda and the IMF \u2019 s Special Drawing Rights global digital currency initiative would require the end of the dollar as the world \u2019 s reserve currency .\nThis is a process the globalists have been talking about openly for some time .\nIt \u2019 s not \u201c conspiracy theory , \u201d it is conspiracy reality .\nThe IMF has argued on many occasions that the global currency framework must be \u201c managed \u201d by a centralized entity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency trade for their own ends , and this includes digital currencies .\nThe stage is already set for this narrative .\nThe U.S. will be painted as an example of why nationalism is a \u201c path to disaster \u201d and why no single nation should be trusted with so much power in the form of a world reserve currency .\nThat kind of power tempts governments not only into excessive money creation power debt-financed spending sprees .\nNot only to print new money to pay for those old debts , thus debasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power worldwide ( also known as inflation ) .\nBut look at what the U.S. did to Russia \u2013 freezing bank accounts and canceling credit cards of the world \u2019 s 10th largest economy .\nThe globalists would call this an abuse of power .\nThroughout history , global reserve currencies have risen and fallen .\nFrom the Greek drachma in the 5th century B.C .\nto the British pound sterling ( 1700-1931 ) , every single one has collapsed .\nAnd the resulting implosion of a reserve currency spreads like a tsunami @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is only \u201c logical \u201d that a global central authority with no national loyalties be put in control of an \u201c international \u201d reserve currency , right ?\nMaybe a multi-currency-based basket system , or , perhaps , a single world currency\u2026 To prevent any future tragedies and abuses of power from ever happening again .\nRight ?\nWorld war , whether economic or kinetic , and the death of the dollar as the global reserve currency is a perfect excuse for the \u201c perfectly rational \u201d introduction of an international financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this ruling council would operate right out in the sun for everyone to see , not in the shadows deep in the bowels of central banking cartels .\nTheir authority would be \u201c official , \u201d and their control established as necessary , even vital for world peace .\nThis is the same thing that has happened after every major war or world war ; the argument is made that national sovereignty was the cause and that nation states should not exist because when people are left to organize into groups they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live , and differing ideas cause conflict .\nAfter World War I , they introduced the League of Nations .\nAfter World War II , they established the UN and the IMF .\nAnd , after economic World War III , they will try to implement a program of one world currency and global economic governance ( and dominance , as well ) .\nGlobalists claim it is better for there to be no sovereignty , no groups and no differing ideas .\n\u201c We need one homogeneous global collective with a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201c so that no conflict ever happens.\n\u201d Of course , they get to have their own group , and that group intends to garner all the benefits of the crisis and the power that will be derived from the panic .\nI strongly recommend you prepare yourself , and your family , for the end of the U.S. dollar \u2019 s global reserve status .\nThat means securing your financial future with what \u2019 s been called \u201c money of last resort , \u201d in other words , physical gold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from hacking , immune to the collapse of the electrical grid and will very likely always be worth something , which is more than we can say for the vast majority of the fallen currencies .\nThey \u2019 re a solid financial foundation to build your future on , whatever the future brings .\nTake yourself off the dollar standard before the globalists do it for you \u2013 because once they come for your dollars , it will be too late .\nWith that warning , I leave you with a quote from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard Gardner , published in Foreign Affairs magazine in 1974 , which I think drives home the reality of the people we are dealing with : In short , the \u201c house of world order \u201d will have to be built from the bottom up rather than from the top down .\nIt will look like a great \u201c booming , buzzing confusion , \u201d to use William James \u2019 famous description of reality , but an end run around national sovereignty , eroding it piece by piece , will accomplish much more @ @ @ @ @ @", "author": "HAF", "url":

titled Stephen Bassett E.T .\nDisclosure Conference 2014 , and I couldn \u2019 t help but notice the reaction counters below it .\nIf they are correct , the information in the video was uncritically accepted by the site \u2019 s visitors , and I found that quite troubling .\nNo one paused to think of who might be behind the information being presented or of how it might fit in with the globalists \u2019 transition plan .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do a little investigating so I could show everyone what \u2019 s really going on with Disclosure .\nTo begin , let \u2019 s look at what Bassett says at the 3:54 mark of the video\u2026 \u201c The Truth Embargo , which I casually refer to , was a massive program in which billions upon billions of dollars were spent not only to keep the research secret , to keep the finances secret , and to keep the media under control , and the philanthropists out of the picture , and the universities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the casual viewer , his mention of \u201c the philanthropists \u201d might sail by unnoticed , but if you \u2019 ve researched how the disclosure movement got started , you know he is actually referring to one specific \u201c philanthropist \u201d : the true father of the Disclosure Movement , Laurance Rockefeller\u2026 \u2026This is a portion of an article on the Open Minds : UFO News and Investigations website which was written by Antonio Huneeus .\nHuneeus has a long history in the Disclosure Movement , has worked with Rockefeller , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Movement at the Citizen Hearing on UFO Disclosure\u2026 \u2026The video is only 9 min 40 sec long , and if you can suffer through Huneeus \u2019 dry delivery , it is quite informative .\nThe Rockefeller role in getting the Disclosure ball rolling is something of an open secret among the Disclosure people ( the Disclosuristas , as I call them ) .\nOn Stephen Bassett \u2019 s own Paradigm Research Group website , a specific Rockefeller effort referred to as the \u201c Rockefeller Initiative \u201d is openly touted The same effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s Disclosure Project website as \u201c Project Starlight \u201c \u2026 \u201c This letter from The Project Starlight Coalition was the result of the historic Asilomar , California meeting that Dr. Greer organized and Laurance Rockefeller paid forin June of 1995 , just before Clinton \u2019 s meeting with Rockefeller in August 1995.\n\u201d As I continued to examine the Rockefeller family connection to the Disclosure Movement , I came across this MUST SEE video which puts together a number of video clips on the subject .\nAt the 1:54 mark , Steven Greer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Movement ) speaks of Laurance Rockefeller : In his remarks on Laurance , Greer refers to him as \u201c the philosopher of the ( Rockefeller ) family , \u201d which is typical of how the Disclosuristas attempt to explain-away Rockefeller family involvement in their movement .\nThey try to paint Laurance as a family maverick who was unlike all the other globalists in the Rockefeller clan .\nGreer also speaks of a supposed conflict between brothers David and Laurance Rockefeller over whether the UFO secrets should be exposed , and this theme of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the Rockefellers is also parroted by Grant Cameron in his testimony at the Citizen Hearing on Disclosure ( page 90 ) \u2026 \u201c Basically what the FOIA documents show is that billionaire businessman Laurance Rockefeller had approached the White House to get the government to disclose the truth behind the UFO mystery.There are different Rockefellers ; there is Nelson Rockefeller who was the political guy who ran for government ; there was David who was the money guy and Laurance Rockefeller was the humanitarian .\nHe had a philosophy degree from Princeton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomenon.\n\u201d Unfortunately for the Disclosuristas , this attempt to paint Laurance as a renegade \u201c good Rockefeller \u201d doesn \u2019 t stand up to scrutiny .\n\u201c In 1937 , he inherited his grandfather \u2019 s seat on the New York Stock Exchange .\nHe served as founding trustee of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund for forty-two years , from its inception in 1940 to 1982 ; during this time he also served as president ( 1958\u20131968 ) and later its chairman ( 1968\u20131980 ) for twenty-two years , longer than any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHe was also a founding trustee of the Rockefeller Family Fund from 1967 to 1977.\n\u201d So not only was Laurance deeply involved in the financial industry , but he was also among the founders of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and the Rockefeller Family Fund .\nThese Funds are notorious for advancing globalist aims under the pretense of \u201c philanthropy.\n\u201d Laurance also served on the Rockefeller Brothers Fund \u2019 s Special Studies Project\u2026 \u201c From 1956 to 1960 the Fund financed an ambitious study conceived by its then president , Nelson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems and opportunities facing the U.S. and clarify national purposes and objectives , and to develop principles which could serve as the basis of future national policy \u2019 .\nNelson recruited Henry Kissinger , who was then on the faculty of Harvard University , as director of the project ; he had first met Kissinger in 1955 .\nHe also brought on board such luminaries as Edward Teller , Charles Percy , Dean Rusk , John Gardner ( president of the Carnegie Corporation ) and Henry Luce , along with his brothers Laurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were constituted that looked at sweeping issues ranging from military/security strategy to foreign policy , to international economic strategy and defense department and governmental reorganization.\n\u201d Of the Special Studies Project \u2019 s seven sub-panels , Laurance is specifically mentioned as having served on : \u201c Panel II \u2013 International Security Objectives and Strategy ; directed by Henry Kissinger .\nPanellists included Frank Altschul , Gordon Dean , James B. Fisk , Roswell Gilpatric , Townsend Hoopes , Henry Luce , Laurance Rockefeller , Edward Teller , Carroll L. Wilson , and economist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s Wikipedia page also had another paragraph that caught my eye : \u201c The project was finally published in its entirety in 1961 as Prospect for America : The Rockefeller Panel Reports .\nThe archival study papers are stored in the Rockefeller Archive Center at the family estate ; portions of the papers are still restricted , over four decades after the report was published.\n\u201d Upon reading this , I ordered a copy of Prospect for America , and it is exactly what I expected : a blueprint for using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build the New World Order .\nHere is a little snippet from page 35 : So as you can see , Laurance was deeply involved in pursuing the Rockefeller family \u2019 s globalist objectives .\nThere was no rift or divergence of interests within the family ( as is evidenced by the cooperation of the three brothers in the Special Studies Project ) ; there was only a division of labor as they collectively worked to build the multilateral/ multipolar New World Order .\nBeing an Illuminati family , the Rockefellers were/are involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomenon : the black budget part , the government coverup part , and the public disclosure part .\nIn pitting disclosure-demanding citizens against secrecy-maintaining governments , the \u201c elite \u201d are creating a conflict that will find resolution when the New World Order and Disclosure are publicly unveiled .\nAt that time , the US government , the Paperclip Nazis , the Zionists , and the West will be blamed for the secrecy while the BRICS and the East will be credited with revealing the truth .\nUFO Disclosure is just another aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Good propaganda effort being used to usher in the NWO .\nOf course , the globalist-directed Disclosure Movement isn \u2019 t run solely by the Rockefellers ; the Vatican is involved too .\nIn an entry titled The Vatican is preparing to introduce the Anunnaki to us , I showed how the Jesuits are working to prepare the public for the announcement of extraterrestrial life , and their preparations extend beyond merely revealing the existence of microbes on Mars .\nHave a look at what non-Jesuit Monsignor Corrado Balducci told the Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is another video where he talks about human-like extraterrestrials : According to his bio\u2026 \u201c Monsignor Corrado Balducci ( born May 11 , 1923 , in Italy ; died September 20 , 2008 in Italy ) was aRoman Catholic theologian of the Vatican Curia , a close friend of the pope , a long-time exorcist for the Archdiocese of Rome , and a Prelate of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples and the Society for the Propagation of the Faith .\nHe has written several books about the subliminal messages in rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and extraterrestrials .\nMonsignor Balducci often appeared on Italian TV to talk about satanism , religion , and extraterrestrials.\n\u201d Assuming this bio is genuine ( I \u2019 m looking into it , and it has checked out so far ) , we see that belief in the reality of extraterrestrial spacecraft and beings has existed at the top level of the Vatican for a long time .\nOf course , since the Vatican is aligned with the traditionalist faction of the Anunnaki and is oriented towards worship of the Anunnaki god-king , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ETs , doesn \u2019 t it ?\nThe Alien Card : How will the globalists play it ?\nIt is clear that the globalist \u201c elite \u201d are inculcating the belief in benevolent extraterrestrials in the public mind .\nBut why ?\nFrom my current perspective , there are three ways they can play the alien card : 1 ) They are already playing it , and they are using UFOs and ETs to distract inquisitive people .\nIf the globalists can get people to look up at the skies , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground as the NWO unfolds .\nThis is the most conventional way of looking at the UFO question .\n2 ) They are preparing the public to accept a fake alien arrival .\nInstead of seeing real ETs arrive in real ET spacecraft , we \u2019 ll see genetically modified humans arriving in black budget aerospace craft .\nGiven that scientists have been publicly cloning complex animals like sheep and genetically modifying goats to produce spider silk in their milk , is it so hard to believe that black budget science has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nIf the globalists unleash upon the public a race of mind-controlled , mystery religion-indoctrinated hybrids flying antigravity craft , they can really play with people \u2019 s minds .\n3 ) They are trying to generate public consent for an intrusion by real extraterrestrial / extradimensional beings .\nBy getting people to believe that all our problems will be solved when the ET/EDs show up , they are building freewill permission for the ET/EDs to step in and run things .\nThe globalists have built the multipolar NWO pyramid\u2026 \u2026so now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and control the world .\nI can \u2019 t yet say with certainty which of these three scenarios is in motion .\nWe \u2019 ll just have to wait and see how weird things get .\nThere is more to write on this subject , but I \u2019 ll stop here and save

vernacular , the Rockefeller family and their minions were making plans to expend America \u2019 s post-World War 2 power to bring about such an order .\nIn the course of researching Laurance Rockefeller for my last entry , \u201c The Rockefellers Are The Founders Of The UFO Disclosure Movement \u2013 Why ?\n, \u201d I came across a book titled Prospect for America : The Rockefeller Panel Reports : \u2026It was the product of a 1956 Rockefeller Brothers Fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it lays out the blueprint for the multilateral / multipolar New World Order that is currently materializing around us .\nIn the aftermath of World War 2 and the resulting formation of the United Nations ( which the Rockefellers were instrumental in creating and funding ) , the Special Studies Project , directed by Henry Kissinger , was formed to carry out two apparent tasks : 1 ) to create an action plan to bring about the \u201c elite \u2019 s \u201d long-sought world government within the existing postwar environment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such a way that it could be sold to the American people as being in their best interest .\nUpon completion of their work , the Special Studies Project \u2019 s various panels compiled their reports in an incomplete , sanitized , and heavily spun book , the above-mentioned Prospect for America .\nThe book spells out how to sacrifice the national interests of the United States for\u2026 To begin our journey through the Rockefeller plan for the NWO , let \u2019 s start with their definition of the Old World Order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Old World Order From pages 163-164 of Prospect for America\u2026 So after having consolidated power over most of the world through empire building , the Occulted Powers ( OPs ) faced a problem .\nEmpires , by their very nature , are territorial , competitive and nationalistic , and are not amenable to submitting to outside control as would be required for world governance .\nClearly , these old structures would need to be demolished and replaced by newer , more malleable structures in order to finish the global consolidation .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and financed the two world wars to break down the old empires and create international chaos from which a New Order could be birthed .\nAt the end of each world war , the OPs immediately planted the seed of global governance , but the seeds didn \u2019 t germinate as expected\u2026 De-spinning the last underlined statement , they are basically saying that the nations were insufficiently motivated to hand over sovereignty to the globalist institutions .\nSo to overcome this lack of \u201c shared aspirations , \u201d the OPs fostered the Cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet Union .\nBy threatening some nations with Soviet aggression and others with American aggression , they compelled the nations to band together and join sides for protection .\nThe members of each side were then pressured to increase economic and defensive cooperation to fend off the menace of the other side .\nThose who were programmed to believe they lived in the \u201c people \u2019 s ( communist ) world \u201d cooperated to block aggression from the \u201c imperialist world , \u201d and those who were programmed to believe they lived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block aggression from the \u201c Soviet sphere \u201d \u2026 In the United States , people were programmed to believe that fending off the \u201c Red Menace \u201d was a matter of life and death\u2026 But the Cold War , just like the current crop of engineered conflicts raging about us ( ISIS , Ukraine , and the China Seas ) , was all about forcing nations into groups and groups into a world order .\nOnce it had served its purpose , the Cold War was ended in order to allow the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2026from The New York Times .\nHere are some key excerpts : > > > President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union ended an exhausting transcontinental visit to the United States today with an appeal for a radically changed system of global alliances\u2026 Rather than strengthening defense , he asserted , alliances of the future should be designed to foster an international unity that would \u201d protect the environment , combat hunger , diseases , drug addiction and ignorance \u201d \u2026 The Soviet leader said his second summit conference with Mr. Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet Union \u201d toward a new world \u201d \u2026 \u201d For a new type of progress throughout the world to become a reality , everyone must change , \u201d Mr. Gorbachev added .\n\u201d Tolerance is the alpha and omega of a new world order.\n\u201d < < < And as one would expect , Prospect for America offers a glimpse of what Gorbachev and Bush \u2019 s New World Order will look like .\nOn page 26 , we \u2019 re told what the OPs and their globalist minions are hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says \u201c combined so as to be able to deal with those problems that increasingly the separate nations will not be able to solve alone.\n\u201d Here they are telling us that they \u2019 ll be purposefully creating increasingly difficult problems to compel the nations to accept the NWO .\nWe \u2019 ve certainly been witnessing that , haven \u2019 t we ?\nAs for the NWO structure itself , we \u2019 re told that it will \u201c consist of regional institutions under an international body of growing [ to the point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book , we \u2019 re told that the NWO will also include functional structures for matters that require management beyond the regional boundaries .\nSo let \u2019 s delve deeper into how such a structure would look and operate : 1 ) At the top is the \u201c international body of growing authority.\n\u201d Needless to say , this is\u2026 2 ) Below the UN will be the\u2026 Here are the ten UN development regions\u2026 And page 190 spells out how the regional arrangements will manifest themselves\u2026 Free trade agreements , joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this all sounds very familiar , doesn \u2019 t it ?\nSo when an East versus West propagandist tries to sell you the idea that the BRICS Development Bank or a Chinese/Russian currency swap deal demonstrates nations trying to free themselves from the New World Order , just remember this passage .\nRussia and China are following the NWO script to the letter , but I \u2019 ll get back to this point a little later in the article .\n3 ) Below the UN will also be\u2026 One example of a functional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuts across regional lines and gives form to the dialectic clash between Anglo-American bankers and BRICS bankers which will birth the NWO .\nAnother example is the International Monetary Fund , which will manage the new global reserve currency after the engineered East versus West drama has climaxed .\nWith the planned structure of the New World Order laid before us , let \u2019 s have a look at how the Rockefellers planned to get America to join in .\nProspect for America goes to great lengths to make the counterintuitive case that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s best interest .\nIt starts by implying that nation-states are somehow outmoded by the fact that they trade with each other , and then it offers the false choice of floundering by engaging in no trade at all\u2026 \u2026 ( from page 60 ) or prospering by engaging in trade managed by the NWO\u2026 \u2026 ( from page 161 ) They conveniently fail to mention that there are many other options besides resorting to either of those two extremes .\nKissinger and Co. also make the assertion that building the NWO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America \u2019 s foreign policy\u2026 \u2026 ( from page 26 ) and that the effectiveness of US policy will be judged by how well America fosters the globalist institutions\u2026 \u2026 ( from page 27 ) Also note how the passage assigns the US to the Western Sphere .\nThe planners had another nation in mind to lead the Eastern Sphere ( China ) .\nThe book then goes on to offer specific ways America can sacrifice its national interests to build the global government .\nOn page 173 , we see the genesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American economy to ruin\u2026 \u2026as the globalists make the case for unilaterally removing the trade barriers that protected America \u2019 s economy from competition with foreign slave labor .\nKissinger and Co. also make the case that we shouldn \u2019 t economically defend ourselves since it might create \u201c impediments\u2026 to the progress of others \u201d \u2026 And to give Americans a taste of what \u2019 s coming , page 75 also drops this little hint\u2026 \u2026As it turns out , America did indeed lay itself down as a bridge to pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it by luring them in with a great deal of our national wealth through lopsided trade and outsourcing .\nAnd this brings us to the subject of the BRICS\u2026 The BRICS role in erecting the New World Order Prospect goes on to address the status of those nations that were \u201c freed \u201d by the engineered collapse of the Old World Order\u2026 If we remove the spin from this passage , it tells us that the new nation-states \u2019 drive to achieve true independence must be \u201c balanced by converging forces.\n\u201d And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d take ?\nThe globalists employed hot & cold wars and insurgencies , trade conflicts , and \u201c economic hit men \u201d to make life unbearable for any nation-state attempting to be independent .\nAll this strife forced such nations to reach out to international institutions for \u201c help \u201d ( which came in the form of military occupation or debt bondage ) .\nOnly in the arms of the globalist institutions would such nations find any peace\u2026 When Prospect spoke on page 60 of what animates such peoples\u2026 \u2026it brought to mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titled David Wilcock and the Real NWO , Part 2 of 2 : > > > Why China ?\nWhy would the Illuminati , whose home base is in Western Europe , have the Chinese front the public face of their New World Order ?\nA clue to their motivations and strategy can be found in this article , titled \u201c Colonial Elite Rules China for the Illuminati.\n\u201d In it , the author states\u2026 \u201c The Chinese people would revolt against overt foreign domination , but embrace their place in the NWO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d The Chinese have suffered greatly at the hands of Western imperialism , as has much of the world .\nAs a result , the Illuminati would have trouble roping many nations into a Western-led New World Order , especially the nationalistic Chinese .\nSince you can \u2019 t have a truly global order without the most populous nation on Earth , the Illuminati opted to use their own legacy of destruction to their advantage .\nTheir two-part strategy to do so is as follows : 1 \u2013 They set up a China-centered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western alliance .\nThis part of the strategy was hinted at in the mainstream press in this 2002 UPI article , titled \u201c China Wants Its Own \u2018 New World Order \u2019 To Oppose US Version.\n\u201d It is common practice for the Cabal to use opposing forces to achieve their ends , and they always make sure they have influence or control over both sides .\n2 \u2013 They have been driving the world public into the hands of the Chinese alliance .\nHow have they approached this , you ask ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ New World Order planned by the Western Powers\u2026 \u2026while simultaneously publicizing a benign New World Order planned by China and its allies\u2026 \u2026thus establishing danger from one side and safety from another .\n> They have instigated outrageous and provocative action , both economic and military , by the Western powers ( this adds a new insight into the open-for-all-to-see Wall Street / City of London criminality and recent Western military boondoggles in Afghanistan , Iraq , Egypt , Libya , and Syria ) .\n> They have broadly exposed damaging information about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the motivation behind WikiLeaks , Snowden , and a thousand smaller disclosures .\nAnd after Snowden outed the NSA \u2019 s activities to the general public , where did he run to hide ?\nFirst to China ( Hong Kong ) , then to Russia .\nSo what is the psychological message ?\nChina and Russia ( the BRICS alliance ) are where you run for safety from the evil US , its Western allies , and all their horrible behavior .\nIt is really very simple : the Illuminati built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alliance ) that looks like a nice , safe hole to hide from danger .\nNow they are beating the bushes ( with the Western powers ) to drive the rabbits toward the trap.\n< < < Clearly , the globalists took into account \u201c the aspirations of peoples all over the globe\u2026 to emerge rapidly and conclusively from the era of colonialism \u201d in their planning of the NWO .\nIt is for this reason that the BRICS alliance was formed and the NWO was designed in a multipolar fashion .\nThey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join together and see themselves beating the West .\nAnd they want them to believe that the Illuminati \u2019 s multipolar New World Order represents their final victory over oppression and ascension to equality , when it is actually just the beginning of a new phase of subjugation and their fall into equality as global serfs .\nWith the Rockefeller plan for the BRICS New World Order laid out before us , let \u2019 s take a look at how it was implemented .\nMajor moves towards building the New World Order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late sixties\u2026 1969 \u2013 The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) introduces the Special Drawing Right , the planned replacement for the US dollar as the global reserve currency\u2026 July 1971 \u2013 former Special Studies Project director Henry Kissinger held secret meetings in China to lay the groundwork for their introduction onto the global stage .\nHere he is with Chinese Premier Chou En-Lai ( a.k.a .\nZhou Enlai ) during the visit\u2026 August 1971 \u2013 President Richard Nixon takes America off of the gold standard\u2026 \u2026This was the first major explosion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the global reserve currency ( to make way for its replacement by the globalists \u2019 SDR sometime around 2018 ) .\nFebruary 1972 \u2013 Nixon visits ( and \u201c opens \u201d ) China .\nHere he is with Chairman Mao\u2026 June 1973 \u2013 David Rockefeller Sr. visits China to start working out implementation details for what is to come .\nHere he is meeting with Premier Chou En-Lai\u2026 So what was set in motion by these events ?\nBy 1978 , Deng Xiaoping took power and \u201c developed \u2018 Socialism with Chinese characteristics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as the \u2018 socialist market economy , \u2019 and opened China to the global market.\n\u201d An interesting view on the hidden dynamics behind this development is offered in the above-linked \u201c Colonial Elite Rules China for the Illuminati \u201d article\u2026 \u201c Wang Hao , a historian at the China Institute of International Studies , has recorded that Mao \u2019 s deputy Zhou Enlai met David Rockefeller in June 1973 : \u2018 When meeting David Rockefeller , Zhou said to him that it was necessary to find appropriate methods conducive to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under different political systems.\n\u2019 The corporate-communist merger began when Deng Xiaoping came to power in the late 1970s and introduced his market reforms with the slogan \u2018 to get rich is glorious.\n\u2019 However , after 30 years of Maoism his regime was hopelessly ill equipped to run a market economy .\nThey turned to the wealthiest Chinese tycoons in Hong Kong for guidance .\nThe most powerful HK tycoon is Li Ka-Shing , the richest Asian in the world and an Illuminati insider.\n\u201d This helped put in place a Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Communist leadership , Hong Kong tycoons , and the criminal Triads .\nAll three factions derive their power from Illuminati collaboration.\n\u201d Needless to say , globalist coordination with China\u2026 In closing , I \u2019 d simply say that any global solution offered to us in the coming years is , in fact , a globalist solution .\nIf you do not get together with your neighbors to start exercising self-sufficiency and control over your life , you will fall into globalist dependency and control by default .\nAnd if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local community to devise a currency ( or other method of trade/barter ) of your own , you will end up using bankster currency by default .\nPower that is not taken into your own hands is left to the predators who grasp for it .\nIn response to this comment from a suspected webtroll\u2026 \u201c How do you know that Putin isn \u2019 t telling Kissinger , \u2018 Buddy , your days are numbered.\n\u2019 \u201d \u2026I looked up an old New York Times article I ran across a while ago\u2026 So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headlines about the supposed conflict between West and East , you \u2019 ll find the truth a little deeper in the paper : that all these political types work for the same bosses and are actually buddies behind the scenes

.\nHowever , the time for diplomacy and meeting leftists halfway is long dead .\nThere is no such thing as a \u201c center \u201d in our society anymore , either you lean conservative and you support freedom , or you lean left and support authoritarianism .\nThere is no magical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make things right .\nWe are not required to tolerate leftist authoritarianism because of \u201c democracy.\n\u201d Sometimes certain ideologies and certain groups are mutually exclusive to freedom ; meaning , they can not coexist within a society that values liberty .\nWe need to be clear about where the lines are drawn , because sitting on the fence is not an option .\nWalk in middle of road ?\nGet squished like grape .\nTo understand how leftists got to the point of enthusiastic hatred of free speech rights there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be addressed .\nThese include specific ideals that leftists value that are disjointed or simply irrational : Hate Speech Is Real And Must Be Censored ?\nFirst , as I have argued for many years , there is no such thing as \u201c hate speech.\n\u201d There is speech that some people don \u2019 t like and speech they are offended by .\nThat is all .\nConstitutionally , there is no hate speech .\nPeople are allowed to say any offensive thing they wish and believe however they wish as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s reputation with lies or threatening them with direct bodily harm .\nIf you are offended by criticism , that is your problem .\nLeftists believe the opposite .\nInstead of growing a thicker skin they think that \u201c hate speech \u201d should be illegal and that they should be the people that determine what hate speech is .\nThis is a kind of magical door to power , because if you can declare yourself the arbiter of hate speech you give yourself the authority to control ALL speech .\nThat is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all you have to do is label everything you don \u2019 t like as hate speech , no matter how factual , and you now dictate the course of society .\nNo one is capable of this kind of objectivity or benevolence .\nNo person alive has the ability to determine what speech is acceptable without bias .\nLike the One Ring in the Lord of The Rings , there is no individual or group capable of wielding such power without being corrupted by it .\nEither there is no hate speech , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in direct reference to social media websites and it \u2019 s an oversimplification of the issue of free speech and large social media platforms .\nHere is the conundrum or \u201c false paradigm \u201d if you will : Leftists argue for private property rights , but only when it comes to vast corporate big tech platforms like Twitter , Facebook , YouTube , etc .\nThey like private property rights for companies that they think are on their side politically ; they hate private property rights for everyone else .\nJust look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s recent Twitter buyout ; the leftists are demanding that Musk be stopped at all costs , and they demand that the SEC and FCC step in to disrupt the sale because they claim Musk \u2019 s purchase is a \u201c threat to democracy.\n\u201d The media itself is clamoring to disrupt Musk \u2019 s takeover of Twitter .\nWhether or not you trust him , Musk \u2019 s acquisition of the platform has at least exposed the totalitarian attitudes of mainstream journalists for everyone to see .\nThey are now even admitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that it is \u201c their job , \u201d and they see Musk as a threat to that monopoly .\nWhy are Elon Musk \u2019 s private property rights less important or protected than the original shareholders of Twitter ( Vangaurd , BlackRock , Morgan Stanley and a Saudi Prince ) ?\nBecause Musk does not claim to represent leftist designs and interests ?\nLeftists have no principles , they only care about manufacturing consent .\nTheir method of winning requires that they never restrict themselves within the boundaries of values or morals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pure evil .\nBeyond that irony , though , is the deeper issue of government intervention vs business rights .\nMany people seem to think that government power is supposed to balance out corporate power when the truth is that governments and corporations work hand in hand ; they are often one in the same entity .\nTwitter and other Big Tech platforms receive billions upon billions of dollars in government stimulus and tax incentives every year .\nCorporations as a concept are essentially a socialist creation .\nThey enjoy limited liability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protections under government charter .\nWith all these protections , incentives , bailouts and stimulus measures it is almost impossible for small and new businesses to compete with them .\nThey represent a monopoly through cartel ; they control the marketplace by colluding with each other and colluding with the government .\nA perfect example of this would be the coordination between multiple Big Tech companies to bring down Parler , a conservative leaning competitor to Twitter .\nThis required some of the biggest companies in the world working in unison along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability of a new company to offer an alternative , and all because Parler was getting too big .\nIn the case of a private person \u2019 s home or their small business or small website , it \u2019 s true that there are no free speech rights .\nThey can kick you out and they don \u2019 t have to give a reason .\nBut when it comes to massive conglomerates that receive billions in OUR tax dollars in order to stay alive , no , they do not deserve private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves into a public utility , and that means they are subject to constitutional limitations just as public schools and universities are .\nThis is a concept that leftists just don \u2019 t grasp .\nThey view corporate power as sacrosanct\u2026as long as it serves their interests .\nConsider global corporations like Disney and their open intention to undermine the passage of Florida \u2019 s anti-grooming bill ; this represents Disney \u2019 s vocal support for the sexualization and indoctrination of children in Florida schools .\nLeftists cheered the announcement and claimed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be wrecked .\nInstead , the state turned the tables and took away incentives they had been giving to Disney for decades .\nLeftists responded by accusing Governor DeSantis of being a \u201c fascist \u201d and attacking free speech .\nBut let \u2019 s break this down : Leftists happily supported Disney , a massive conglomerate , and their efforts to undermine the will of the voters in Florida .\nThe state government stops them from undermining the voters by taking away the money and special incentives that belong to the voters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a violation of Disney \u2019 s rights ?\nThe disparity between leftist arguments on Elon Musk \u2019 s takeover of Twitter vs. Disney \u2019 s attempted sabotage of Florida law could not be more confused .\nWhen it comes to Twitter they love the idea of censorship and react with panic when the mere prospect of free speech ( within the confines of US law ) is presented .\nWhen it comes to Disney , they say they love the idea of free speech , and anyone that wants to limit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter how criminal , is accused of fascism .\nThe difference is obvious \u2013 Musk appears to be an uncontrolled element , while Disney is an \u201c ally.\n\u201d Free speech and property rights are only allowed for one side of the cultural divide .\nLeftists attacking freedom is free speech ; defending ourselves against those attacks is a threat to democracy .\nIt \u2019 s absurd .\nDisinformation is a Threat and Censorship is the Solution ?\nThe holy grail of censorship is not website filters and algorithms , because as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platforms could be built or purchased by someone that does not share in the leftist agenda .\nInstead , government intervention and the ability to define what is proper and improper discourse is the ultimate goal .\nThe end game of authoritarians is always to write mass censorship into law , as if it is justified once it is codified .\nCorporate elites and political puppets like Biden pontificating about the threat of \u201c disinformation \u201d is hilarious for a number of reasons , but mainly because it is the power brokers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purveyors of disinformation for a long time .\nSuddenly today they care about the spread of lies ?\nI think it is obvious that such people are far more worried about the spread of facts , evidence and truth .\nThey can not debate on fair ground because they will lose , so , the only other option is to silence us .\nThe institution of the Disinformation Governance Board is a clear indication that the establishment and the useful idiots on the political left are becoming DESPERATE .\nTheir grip on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw this during their recent attempts to enforce medical tyranny across the country in the name of covid .\nLuckily , conservatives in at least 20 red states fought against the implementation of covid lockdowns , mandates and jjab passports which would have annihilated our constitutional rights forever .\nFor years I heard the argument that when the jackboots arrived conservatives would do nothing , and now we know this is nonsense .\nSome of the few free places in the world during two years of pandemic fear mongering were red states in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest concentration of conservatives .\nIf you want to know what our country would look like had conservatives not stopped the tide of tyranny , just take a gander at China today .\nThey have some of the strictest covid mandates on the planet and yet they are once again locking down millions of citizens due to \u201c high infection rates.\n\u201d Not only that , but they are starving their own people in the process .\nIt \u2019 s madness , and it \u2019 s exactly what leftists were arguing in favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The US is mostly open today , just as red states like mine have been free for almost the entirety of the pandemic , and what has changed ?\nHalf the country is still unvaccinated \u2013 Is there mass death in the streets ?\nNope .\nNothing has changed in terms of covid .\nThe mandates made no difference whatsoever , other than to disrupt the economy and reduce people \u2019 s freedoms .\nNot long ago , pointing out this fact was considered \u201c disinformation \u201d that needed to be silenced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hunter Biden laptop story was called disinformation .\nThe Wuhan Lab story was called disinformation .\nFauci \u2019 s gain of function research on covid at the Wuhan lab was called disinformation .\nThe fact that vaccinated people still contract and die from covid was called disinformation .\nIn other words , what the government and corporate oligarchs call \u201c disinformation \u201d today is eventually called reality tomorrow .\nI would be happy to enter into a fair debate with White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on any of the above issues and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d but she would never do such a thing because she knows she would be crushed like a bug .\nIt is not the government \u2019 s job to protect the public from information , whether real or fake .\nIt is not their job to filter or censor data or ideas .\nThey are not qualified to do this .\nNo one is .\nLeftists operate from a collectivist mentality and this makes them believe that society is a singular entity that needs to be managed and manipulated to achieve a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of individual responsibility and discernment , but that is a side note to the real problem .\nThey support information control because facts and ideas outside of their narrative could possibly damage that narrative .\nAnd , if the narrative is damaged they lose their feeling of power , which is all they really care about .\nIf your narrative is so fragile that it does not hold up to scrutiny or alternative viewpoints then it must not be worth much of a damn .\nIf you have to force people or manipulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then your ideology must be fundamentally flawed .\nThe truth speaks volumes for itself and eventually wins without force .\nOnly lies need to be forced into the collective consciousness .\nOnly lies require tyranny .\nEventually reality wins over propaganda , unless total censorship and totalitarianism can be achieved .\nNothing has changed in the 200+ years since the creation of the Bill of Rights .\nFree speech is still integral to a functioning society .\nWithout it , society crumbles .\nThey will claim that today things are different and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from itself.\n\u201d This is what tyrants always say when trying to steal power .\nMost people reading this know by now that this is a war .\nIt \u2019 s not a political debate that requires give-and-take , but a full-bore winner-take-all conflict .\nA DHS faction which is mandated to monitor our speech and propagandize the public is unacceptable and must be eliminated .\nLeftist and globalist monopoly of social media communications platforms is unacceptable and must be eliminated .\nThe imposition of leftist and globalist ideology into the media narrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and must be eliminated .\nThis is about saving the remaining embers of American culture .\nIf we do not take an aggressive stand now , the next generation may never know liberty .\nEverything we hold dear is at stake .", "author": "HAF", "url":

development of perception and extrasensory faculties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves : how can we activate our pineal gland ?\nIn practically all regions of the world , we can find seminars and workshops

the difference ?\nGenerally speaking , we are all old souls , but some of us have been here longer than others .\nThe word \u201c old \u201d is only relative to time .\nBecause time is linear and our souls are eternal , 10,000 years would be the blink of an eye .\nDolores Cannon believes that we need to incarnate many , many times to learn all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16 Ways To Tell If You Are An Old Soul 1 .\nYou understand many of life \u2019 s deeper lessons .\nFor some people , it is hard to fathom that the soul of a child may be much older than the soul of his or her parents .\nFor these particular people , this is a sign that their soul might be younger than yours .\nWhen you begin to understand why you keep incarnating to this 3rd dimensional reality , it becomes similar to the movie , Groundhog Day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out that it \u2019 s still February 2nd until he learns how to remove his ego and starts doing kind deeds for others .\nOnce you realize that time , space , energy and matter are 3rd dimensional products , the theory of time becomes irrelevant , thus the theory of how old your soul is also becomes irrelevant .\nBut for the sake of understanding how old your soul may be , we \u2019 ll continue !\n2 .\nYou are in touch with your natural abilities or have an extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are born with innate gifts , such as special healing abilities or psychic abilities .\nThe truth is that we all possess these abilities , but an older soul is more in tune with how to access and implement these abilities in the name of humanity .\nIf you don \u2019 t have any particular ability , but have a strong interest in them , this is simply your soul trying to recall these abilities that you may have had in a previous lifetime .\nEveryone is pure consciousness , but many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means .\nYour soul is pure consciousness and love .\nIt has a unique understanding of how the matrix is being played on this planet and understands that everything we do as a collective will help to facilitate the awakening of others .\n4 .\nYou understand the importance of forgiveness .\nSome people are old souls who still have much to learn because they are trapped inside the box with their ideologies , they are stubborn , or they have not learned the importance of forgiveness .\nBy forgiving yourself and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these people .\nIt \u2019 s nearly impossible for anyone to completely transcend ego 100 % of the time but simply being aware of our ego and how it plays against unity consciousness is a definite sign of an old soul .\nOn the other side , there is no ego .\nDuring your life review , you will re-live your ego and will see how it affected others , as well as yourself .\nAt this point in \u201c time \u201d , you will probably make a soul contract with the hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ego issues you had in your previous incarnation .\nMoney and materialism are products of this 3rd dimensional reality and it \u2019 s easy to succumb to materialism , especially when it \u2019 s in your face through advertising , programming and peer pressure .\nAn older soul realizes that money is non-existent on the other side and it generally takes away from who we truly are as spiritual beings .\nThose who are older souls will generally use money as a tool to either help facilitate their spiritual progression through spiritual retreats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shui home decorated with spiritual meaning versus the most luxurious furnishings .\nThey may also use their money to help others who are less fortunate .\n7 .\nYou are able to understand the concept that your body is a shell for your soul .\nBefore you were born , you not only chose your parents , you also chose your life situations and challenges that would help to facilitate your spiritual growth while atoning for any previous karma .\nThe body that you are currently in is simply a vessel for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul currently refers itself as , but in previous lifetimes , you had many different names and you have lived many previous lives as either a male or a female .\nYour name and title are both associated with ego because ultimately , you are infinite consciousness and we are all on the same team .\n8 .\nYou seem to have a special connection to eras long before you were born .\nDid you ever watch an old movie or see some artwork from a specific era in time and have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you lived a previous life during that time period and this is your cellular memory letting you know !\n9 .\nYou have an understanding of what you need to do to complete your spiritual progression .\nJust by making it this far , you are more awakened than most people on this planet .\nYou have an understanding of Universal laws and what is left to do on your soul contract .\nEven if you are not specifically sure of either , your higher self and spirit guides will continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 .\nYou have a strong feeling that home isn \u2019 t Earth .\nDid you ever look at a random area of the sky and stare at an unknown star for no particular reason ?\nDo you have a special connection with specific star systems such as the Pleiades or Orion \u2019 s Belt ?\nDo wars and corruption make you feel uneasy , as if they didn \u2019 t exist where you originally came from ?\nAre you one of the souls who volunteered to come here at this specific point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s ascension ?\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions , then chances are , Earth is not your home planet .\n11 .\nYou tend to be a loner .\nThe stigma on the word loner is often condescending , but those who are old souls are merely looking for other fragments of themselves and will often distance themselves from younger souls who need more incarnations into a 3rd dimensional planet .\nOlder souls will seek out other like-minded people because there \u2019 s a comfort and familiarity with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to facilitate each others spiritual progression .\nWhether you rebel from religion , laws or anything else , this is a sign that your soul knows the only true laws\u2026 the Laws of the Universe .\nWhile you respect the reasoning and intention behind laws and religion , you might not be compelled to use these as absolute laws when you know there are a set of higher laws that are intended to facilitate our spiritual progressions .\n13 .\nYou have a burning desire to attain truth and inner wisdom .\nMany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies we \u2019 ve been taught through religion , politics and through our educational facilities .\nWhile they realize they are all one with the universe , they also want the truth exposed to help other people \u2019 s awakening process .\nThey also continue to seek knowledge in the spiritual , metaphysical and esoteric fields and will absorb this information much easier than anything they were taught in school .\n14 .\nYou are not controlling of others .\nOlder souls are more accepting , not just of other people , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while you don \u2019 t approve of the corruption within politics , you understand how the corruption will help to awaken other people to the truth .\nYou respect the free will of others and are more likely to use tact than verbal demands of others .\nYou tend to be more of a team player than anything else .\n15 .\nYou sense a separation between yourself and the \u201c real world \u201d .\nAs you transcend ego and materialism , you find yourself living a different lifestyle .\nWhile this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there also seems to be a familiarity of the direction you \u2019 re heading .\n16 .\nYou are curious whether you \u2019 re an old soul or not .\nMany young souls wouldn \u2019 t ask this question or much less be concerned about it .\nWhile many older souls aren \u2019 t concerned either , for different reasons , they simply \u201c know \u201d they \u2019 re old souls , but it \u2019 s nice to have affirmations that coincide with your spiritual progression .\nThere are many lessons we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which has culminated into this particular incarnation .\nAll of your previous life incarnations are embedded into your cellular memory and can be recalled through past life regressions .\nMost of the people on this planet are old souls , yet many remain unawakened and still have a lot more to learn and will need several more incarnations to a 3rd dimensional planet .\nMany of those who are awakened will probably move on to their next level of spiritual progression .\nIt \u2019 s important to remember that this is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we all win .\nEnjoy every millisecond in this incarnation because this may be the last time you \u2019 ll ever experience a 3rd dimensional reality !", "author": "HAF", "url":

large portions of the indigenous populations with European diseases , the federal government took to forcibly assimilating the remaining population in government institutions .\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries , hundreds of federal schools were set up across the country in which Native children were taken from their families and tribes to be re-educated into the American way of life .\nWithin these facilities , tens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexually abused as \u201c teachers \u201d forced them to talk , dress and act \u201c American.\n\u201d In these boarding schools , children were prohibited

"Exposing the \u2018Digital ID is a Human Right\u2019 Scam", "content": "( Derrick Broze ) \u2013 A major component of the Great Reset-Technocratic Agenda is the implementation of a worldwide digital identity scheme .\nOne of the first steps to realize this goal is to convince the public that digital identity programs are a \u201c human right \u201d worth fighting for .\nWhy is the push for digital identity absolutely vital to the Technocrats visions ?\nThe world of 2030 \u2014 the one in which the World Economic Forum imagines \u201c you will own nothing and be happy \u201d \u2014 depends on an all-encompassing digital id program .\nThis digital ID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the authorities can see every purchase and every move you make .\nOne could argue much of society has already handed over this data with the ubiquitous use of credit cards which track purchases , and phones which log GPS data .\nHowever , the digital ID scheme will also be linked to a digital wallet holding the local Central Bank Digital Currency ( CBDC ) , the digital currency of governments which will be needed for all legal transactions .\nEventually , this digital ID and the digital wallet will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your individual social credit score .\nAs I have reported since March 2020 , these initiatives were already in the works prior to COVID-19 .\nHowever , it was the beginning of the COVID-19 panic that allowed governments around the world to push further towards their vision of Technocracy .\nFor example , we have been told that use of cash should be greatly reduced or eliminated altogether because of reports claiming COVID-19 spread through dirty old money .\nThis conveniently leads into the calls for digital currency programs such as CBDCs .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for \u201c contact tracing \u201d apps to track the alleged spread of disease , and jjab passport/health passport apps have begun to acclimate the public to carrying a digital ID card with them everywhere they go .\nThe jjab passport is simply a gateway to a digital identity which has already been in the works in the United States , to one degree or another , since at least 2005 with the passing of the controversial REAL ID Act .\nThis push towards a digital identity has its roots in the United Nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ) are a collection of 17 interlinked objectives adopted by the United Nations in 2015 with the ostensible goal of ending poverty , protecting the planet , and spreading peace and prosperity to all people by 2030 .\nTheir actions , however , regularly belie their stated intentions .\nThe SDGs were part of a larger resolution known as the 2030 Agenda , or Agenda 2030 , with the stated purpose of fighting climate change .\nWhile the United Nations SDGs and Agenda 2030 are often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multilateral relationships between nations , in truth , they are based in a deeper agenda to monitor , control , and direct all life on the planet .\nThe 17 SDGs each tackle a different area of their ostensible fight for justice and equality .\nUN SDG 16 focuses on \u201c Peace , Justice , and Strong Institutions \u201d and states that \u201c by 2030 , provide legal identity for all , including birth registration.\n\u201d One document from the United Nations titled \u201c United Nations Strategy for Legal Identity for All \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal \u201d and \u201c digital identity.\n\u201d A legal identity is essentially a form of registration with a civil body ( a government ) .\nThe UN document makes it clear that \u201c legal identity is widely acknowledged to be catalytic for achieving at least ten of the SDGs \u201c , and the data generated by the registration supports the measurement of more than 60 SDG indicators .\n\u201c Legal identity has a critical role to ensure the global community upholds its promise of leaving no one behind as espoused in the 2030 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhen it comes to digital identity , the document says digital identity is generally understood as a unique and constant identity \u2014 a virtual identification card , for example \u2014 assigned to individuals that authenticates them as users of all their portable digital devices .\nThis identity can apply to the digital and physical worlds .\nUsing a digital identity involves passwords , cryptographic key , biometrics such as fingerprint or iris scanning .\nAs we approach 2030 the \u201c digital identity as a human right \u201d meme is increasingly being planted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would expect this trend to become a standard talking point amongst corporate media hacks and their followers .\nNot only is the public being primed to accept digital identity as a method of tracking illness ( and the population ) , but digital identity is being sold to the bleeding hearts of the Western world as a necessity for helping the so-called \u201c unbanked \u201d of the world and bringing them into modern financial systems .\nThe term unbanked refers to those people who , for one reason or another , lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent lack is often reported as a flaw of modern society , an example of another poor population being left behind .\nWhat goes unquestioned is whether integration into the banking system is the best thing for an individual or not .\nIt is assumed that all people should need or want to be involved in the debt based banking system , allowing the criminal banks behind The Great Reset to fund their projects with the people \u2019 s money .\nMany of these people live in the developing world , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counter or informal economy of people trading , buying , and selling goods without taxes , regulations , or a digital record of any kind .\nThis type of economic and social activity is the exact behavior the Technocrats want to eliminate , precisely because it flies in the face of the Great Reset vision .\nThus the media must do its job to convince the public that colonization is not colonization when it involves sustainability and diversity .\nThe people need to be convinced that those poor Mexican farmers won \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ID , with a digital wallet for receiving the digital currency as part of the Universal Basic Income program .\nThese gushing stories promoting digital identity as the savior of the developing world fail to mention the dark side to the digitization of all life , specifically the coming terror of social credit and social impact finance tools .\nInstead we get headlines like , \u201c Digital Inclusion .\nThe Human Right to Have an Identity \u201d from the Thales Group , a French multinational with ties to the French government and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world .\n\u201c The lack of identity is not just a loss in terms of being seen by the system and society .\nIt is an exclusion that prevents people from achieving their full potential .\nThey can not be educated , they can not access healthcare services , and their children inherit this legacy as they \u2019 re born outside the system , \u201d the group wrote in February 2021 .\nAgain , the general assumption is that there is no life to be had \u201c outside the system \u201d .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ promoting the SDGs , published a piece titled \u201c Digital Identity As a Basic Human Right \u201d in May 2018 .\nThe Impakter piece promotes blockchain based ID \u2019 s and putting children \u2019 s birth certificates on the blockchain as well .\nThankfully there are some examples of pushback to the commonly held narratives surrounding digital id .\nIn April 2021 , the Center for Human Rights and Global Justice published a skeptical piece titled \u201c Everyone Counts !\nEnsuring that the human rights of all are respected in digital ID systems.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ways marginalized populations are further marginalized by digital systems .\nThey warn of the \u201c need for the human rights movement to engage in discussions about digital transformation so that fundamental rights are not lost in the rush to build a \u2018 modern , digital state \u2019 .\n\u201d The group Access Now published a report , Busting the dangerous myths of Big ID programs : cautionary lessons from India , focused on the concerns surrounding India \u2019 s implementation of their digital ID system , Aadhaar .\nThe report concludes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is programs implemented by governments with the help of Big Tech \u2014 are not needed to give people a legal identity .\nFurther , the report found that Big ID creates space for surveillance to flourish , as demonstrated by India \u2019 s Aadhaar system .\nIn May 2021 , the ACLU released a blog in response to concerns around jjab passports .\nThe ACLU warned about digital identities , including recent efforts to mandate digital drivers licenses .\n\u201c A move to digital IDs is not a minor change but one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identification in our society , increase inequality , and turn into a privacy nightmare , \u201d the ACLU wrote .\nFinally , the organization Privacy International directly challenged the United Nations SDGs and asked , \u201c The Sustainable Development Goals , Identity , and Privacy : Does their implementation risk human rights ?\n.\n\u201d The report states : \u201c If actors fail to consider the risks , ID systems can themselves threaten human rights , particularly the right to privacy .\nThey can become tools for surveillance by the state and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than include .\nThere are thus risks in the implementation of an ID scheme \u2013 not only that it fails to meet the promise of SDG 16.9 , but that it also builds a system for surveillance and exclusion .\nIt is thus essential to critically engage with the interpretation of the goal , and the uses to which it has been put.\n\u201d The World Economic Forum , the United Nations , and The World Bank The United Nations is not the only supranational body lobbying for digital identity .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met for their annual meeting to discuss the \u201c Davos Agenda.\n\u201d As TLAV previously reported , the January meeting was focused on restoring trust and outlining the plan for The Great Reset .\nIn the lead up to the January 2021 meeting the WEF published an article titled \u201c How digital identity can improve lives in a post-COVID-19 world.\n\u201d The article notes , \u201c while government \u2019 s role is key , regulators have understood that they don \u2019 t hold all the cards and that solutions are needed across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust frameworks led by governments working with the private sector are emerging.\n\u201d This discussion of \u201c frameworks led by governments working with the private sector \u201d is exactly the public-private partnership the WEF has been promoting for decades .\nWe should also remember that the WEF was one of the first organizations to begin promoting the idea of jjab passports as part of a \u201c new normal.\n\u201d The WEF would officially announce The Great Reset initiative in June 2020 , only 3 months into the COVID-19 panic .\nOf course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ultimately a refinement of the UN \u2019 s Agenda 2030 and SDGs .\nThus it should come as no surprise that the UN is also working on a form of digital identity .\nThe UN Digital Solutions Centre ( UN DSC ) has developed an \u201c innovative digital identity solution for UN personnel.\n\u201d The UN DSC , a pilot project of the UN World Food Programme ( WFP ) and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , says they are working on a suite of digital solutions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c transform common business operations and streamline time-consuming transactional tasks.\n\u201d The UN Digital ID will use blockchain and some form of biometrics .\nIt has been described as a digital wallet for UN personnel .\nThe UN DSC website describes the project as \u201c based on a blockchain , biometrics and a mobile app solution , this pilot will look to offer a unique digital ID for every UN employee for end-to-end lifecycle management from on-boarding through to retirement that will be immutable , protected , transparent and portable.\n\u201d While the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptance of digital identity , the World Bank has been funding the development of such programs as part of the Identification for Development ( ID4D ) initiative .\nThe World Bank is funding digital biometric ID programs in Mexico , pushing digital ID in poorer countries with the ostensible goal of providing legal identity to the 1.1 billion people who do not currently have one .\nLuis Fernando Garc\u00eda , the director of the Mexican digital rights organization R3D , says the programs are being funded by those interested in exploiting Mexico \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies in rich countries are delighted that poor countries are creating these databases of people that they can exploit for their benefit .\nThey have offensive capabilities that allow them to attack , obtain , and collect information that less-developed countries create through these databases , \u201d he stated in a 2021 interview .\n\u201c Like many other Global South national identity projects \u2014 whether in Kenya , Uganda , or Mexico \u2014 the World Bank is behind it .\nThe World Bank is giving Mexico a loan of $ 225 million to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promoting this approach in Germany or Canada or the U.S. : countries that do not have a national identity system .\nBut they are promoting it in the Global South , which is very telling.\n\u201d At the same time an alliance of Microsoft , GAVI \u2014 the Global Vaccine Alliance which is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation \u2014 and the Rockefeller Foundation have organized their efforts under the ID2020 project .\nThe ID2020 project is an attempt to create digital identification for every single person on the planet .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ partnership with the ID2020 project at the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland .\nThe usual cast of characters \u2014 the WEF , the UN , the World Bank , the Gates Foundation , the Rockefeller Foundation \u2014 have spent the recent years lobbying for the need to create a digital identity for every person on the planet .\nDuring the COVID-19 crisis , these organizations promoted the use of jjab passports , which itself is a form of a digital identity .\nNow , they are poised to use economic turmoil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the value of digital identity , whether to receive a digital currency in exchange for dollars , or to prove vaccination status .\nOne way or another , the Technocrats will force their digital identity prisons on the masses .\nColonization 3.0 and the Future of Identity The colonization of the Americas and Africa took place in the obvious forms \u2014 physical slavery , murder , rape , erasing of language , customs , and culture , etc .\n\u2014 and in less obvious ways \u2014 psychological trauma , isolation , loss of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empires were the first wave of the colonization , with later colonization in the form of weaponized financial aid and assistance designed to trap developing nations in debts which require them to sell their natural wealth and resources .\nNow , digital colonization is on the horizon .\nOnce again , Africa and Latin America are on the list of targets for digital id schemes .\nAs Impakter Magazine reported , there are plans for placing infant identity on a blockchain so there may be a permanent record of the person .\nThese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa .\nDr. Aaron Ramodumo says the country is on a \u201c progressive transition \u201d towards using biometrics for an infant identity with unique ID numbers .\nSouth Africa \u2019 s new program will begin in 2024 , and provide capabilities for palm prints , fingerprint , footprint , face and iris biometrics .\nRamodumo told Biometric Update he hopes it will be available for infants soon .\n\u201c While we want to build a policy around biometric capture of infants and children , we still have not made a selection of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c And that continues to be a subject of research , and I hope researchers will provide other options to choose from.\n\u201d Another organization which has been calling for a \u201c legal identity \u201d in Africa is ID4Africa .\nCoincidentally , the organization received 3 grants totaling $ 600,000 USD from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2019 and 2021 .\nDespite the attempts to colonize Africa with digital identity , there is some hope .\nIn late 2021 , Kenya \u2019 s digital ID program , the National Integrated Identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruled illegal by the highest court because the government did not clearly establish the data privacy risks , nor did they outline a strategy for measuring and mitigating risks .\nUltimately , the crux of this discussion centers around identity and what is needed for a person to operate in the world today .\nFor example , in many nations a person already can not open a bank account , attend school , rent a house , take out a loan , or drive a vehicle legally without presenting some form of identification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the modern world have come to accept as norms .\nHowever , there is a growing skepticism of the incoming digital systems , and , in some cases , even the \u201c traditional \u201d systems most people are familiar with .\nWhy should we have to show a government approved ID to be recognized as a person ?\nWhy must we submit to the government sanctioned identity if we do choose to carry a form of identity ( digital or physical ) ?\nThese are important questions to ask and the assumptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we push further into the digital world of 2030 , I encourage all readers to alert your friends and family to the dangers posed by digital identity .\nHelp them understand how digital id will inevitably be connected to digital currency , and eventually , a social credit score .\nThis infrastructure , along with widespread facial recognition cameras , will be the invisible enforcement arm of the Technocratic State .\nTogether , facial recognition , digital identity , digital currency , and social credit scores represent a giant leap forward towards digital @ @", "author": "HAF", "url": "https://humansbefree.com/2022/05/exposing-the-digital-id-is-a-human-right-scam.html",

on May 22 , 1949 .\nMore precisely , at 1:50 AM which makes the case more mysterious .\nThe circumstances surrounding Forrestal \u2019 s dying hours were engulfed in dispute .\nAll we know for definite is that Forrestal \u2019 s body was discovered on the third story canopy of the Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland in the early hours of the 22nd .\nDid he take a fatal leap out of the window of the 13th floor of the hospital , his mind in turmoil and suicide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident ?\nOr , was Forrestal assassinated ?\nThis is because , for years , there have been suspicions that Forrestal was aware of something ( perhaps everything ) the US government was concealing about UFOs in the late 1940s .\nIt was only a matter of time before Forrestal began to demonstrate psychological difficulties .\nDepression , allegedly brought on by his massive workload , was cited as the primary culprit .\nThe situation deteriorated further : the depression worsened , anxiety attacks began , and a significant dose of paranoia overcame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US government , as Secretary of Defense Forrestal was a critical component of the country \u2019 s infrastructure .\nHowever , President Truman secretly designated him as a potential threat to the Department of Defense \u2019 s orderly operation due to his psychological problems .\nBy the end of 1948 , Forrestal \u2019 s precarious mental state had deteriorated further .\nAt some point , action has to be taken .\nAnd it most emphatically was .\nForrestal was relieved of his duties as Secretary of Defense .\nThe government \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regaining his health .\nNaturally , no one wanted the man to suffer or devolve into a life-threatening condition .\nAs a result , the decision was made to admit Forrestal to the aforementioned Bethesda Naval Hospital , where he could hopefully recover .\nMost concerning for Truman \u2019 s team , though , was the genuine danger that a destabilized Forrestal may run off the tracks and reveal some of the most closely held secrets of the US government .\nIt was a perilous and unpredictably dangerous era .\nIt would quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a strange incident a few days before he landed up in the naval hospital that had obvious Men in Black overtones .\nOn the day in question , Forrestal was visited by one of his friends , a man named Ferdinand Eberstadt , who expressed grave concern about Forrestal \u2019 s frail and paranoid mental state .\nEberstadt ( a lawyer , a banker , and the author of a 1945 paper titled \u201c Task Force Report on National Security Organization \u201d ) was taken aback by what he witnessed upon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All of the drapes had been drawn .\nIn hushed tones , Forrestal informed his acquaintance that listening devices were hidden throughout the house .\nSinister characters were keeping a close eye on his every step .\nHis life was jeopardized .\nPerhaps it was .\nTo explain this to Eberstadt , Forrestal carefully opened one of the slats and nodded knowingly toward a pair of scruffily dressed individuals on the street corner .\nForrestal told Eberstadt that \u201c they \u201d were a part of it .\nWithin seconds , the doorbell at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nForrestal had no intention of answering the door .\nFortunately , one of his staff members was on hand to assist him .\nA brief chat occurred , but neither Forrestal nor Eberstadt could hear it .\nThe facts , however , swiftly came to Forrestal from his houseboy .\nAccording to what the two men were told , the visitor at the door was attempting to garner support for a postmaster position in his community .\nCould he come in and chat with Forrestal , soliciting his assistance and advice ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the man was immediately dismissed .\nEberstadt and Forrestal kept a close eye on the man as he walked directly toward the two ill-dressed individuals who had already thrown Forrestal for a loop .\nWhen Forrestal observed the three clearly conversing , he believed that this was additional evidence of a conspiracy against him .\nPerhaps the entire situation was exaggerated by a guy devolving into a communal state of paranoia , terror , and nervous collapse .\nWithout a doubt , that is what occurred .\nHowever , it \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during Eberstadt \u2019 s visit and has some Men in Black parallels .\nTo begin , the Men in Black are frequently characterized as seeming out of place : their complexion is exceedingly pale , their eyes are frequently bulging ( hidden behind wraparound shades ) , and they are occasionally portrayed as wearing wigs and make-up .\nThe implication is that they are not human beings .\nOn the day in question , Forrestal \u2019 s workers described his visitor as quite odd-looking .\nThe man \u2019 s attempt to obtain access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be seeking support for a future postmaster job \u2013 parallels 1960s stories of MIBs breaking into the homes of UFO witnesses by posing as military troops or police officials .\nWomen in Black posed as census takers and gypsies during the same time period .\nClearly , they were neither .\nForrestal found himself in an unusual and scary predicament .\nTerrifying , too , for the man whose mind was crashing horribly .\nOn April 2 , 1949 , Forrestal was admitted to the hospital \u2014 for his own safety and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well .\nDoctors and nurses immediately recognized Forrestal \u2019 s perilous condition .\nForrestal had a strong suspicion \u2013 no , he was certain \u2013 that deadly characters were following his every move .\nWho those same persons could have been varied considerably according to Forrestal \u2019 s frame : at times , they were Russian agents .\nAt other times , it was US government spies .\nForrestal believed the latter was headed by J. Edgar Hoover \u2019 s FBI .\nForrestal \u2019 s head was whirling \u2013 and not in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating for a period of time .\nThis is not a good sign .\nIt \u2019 s critical to remember that when Forrestal was admitted to Bethesda , he was placed in what amounted to solitary confinement , with the room \u2019 s windows modified to prevent them from being opened .\nNotably , when Forrestal \u2019 s family inquired as to why such actions were taken , Captain George N. Raines , Bethesda \u2019 s chief psychiatrist , stated that they were taken to prevent Forrestal from leaping out of the windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe , is precisely what happened on the fateful night Forrestal \u2019 s life ended .\nAfter a few weeks in the hospital , Forrestal showed a noticeable , and gratifying , recovery .\nDoctors and nurses both confirmed .\nAdditionally , his appetite began to return .\nTo the point that Forrestal chowed down on a massive steak in the presence of Rear Admiral Morton Willcutts , who had come to meet an old friend .\nIndeed , it appeared as though prosperous times were ahead .\nThat everything changed two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two nights later .\nDeath was on the horizon .\nIt was a death that was shrouded in secrecy .\nLet us examine what we do know for certain about those final hours of someone who possessed some of the most vital secrets of the US government .\nEdward Prise was instructed to keep a close eye on Forrestal .\nHe was a corpsman in the United States Navy .\nDue to the length of their time together , the duo developed a strong friendship .\nAs the night wore on , Forrestal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need of a sleeping drug and would instead immerse himself in a book .\nThat , too , was a positive development .\nOr , at least , it appeared to be .\nFollowing the conclusion of Prise \u2019 s shift , he was replaced by another military veteran , Robert Wayne Harrison , Jr. Forrestal \u2019 s demise was inevitable .\nHarrison , Jr. left the room during his shift to perform an errand .\nFrom that point on , everything becomes very foggy and unclear \u2013 and almost certainly something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s satisfaction .\nWhen Harrison , Jr. returned to his room , he was astounded to see Forrestal was not in his bed .\nAdditionally , the windows of the room were open .\nHarrison Jr. dashed to the window , where the string of Forrestal \u2019 s dressing robe was secured to a radiator near the window .\nClearly , the objective was to kill through strangling .\nHowever , it turned out that Forrestal \u2019 s weight caused the cable to snap , and Forrestal plunged ten stories to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have survived .\nThe official theory is that Forrestal committed suicide after being left alone in his room , probably in a brief moment when his mind reverted to that perilous state of sadness and worry .\nThe critical question , though , is whether Forrestal was pressured .\nThe reason : to ensure that he could never , ever share whatever he may have encountered while serving in government .\nOne could argue that Forrestal \u2019 s death was staged to appear as a suicide when , in fact , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to a critical point : what about the UFO connection to all of this ?\nTo begin , there is the Men in Black / Women in Black controversy .\nWithin Ufology , reports have swirled for decades that Forrestal was seriously considering going public with what he had learned about the UFO phenomenon following his appointment as Secretary of Defense .\nIt \u2019 s critical to remember that , as the nation \u2019 s first Secretary of Defense , Forrestal would have undoubtedly been exposed to the UFO phenomenon \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspects .\nAdditionally , there is a document .\nHowever , we should not get too thrilled .\nThe document is one of those vexing purported \u201c secret files \u201d that can only be obtained by whistleblowers .\nBob Wood and Ryan Wood , father and son ufologists , received the document .\nIt was presented to the couple by another ufologist ( Tim Cooper ) .\nThe reproduced document makes it very evident that Forrestal was murdered as a result of his knowledge of UFOs and his plans for all the secrets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the document provides us with an excessive amount of information .\nAnd no one in government \u2013 ever \u2013 would produce a paper that basically says , \u201c Please go ahead and assassinate Secretary of Defense Forrestal due to his knowledge of UFOs.\n\u201d Such an act is ludicrous .\nIf Forrestal had been assassinated , the facts would never have been recorded .\nThat is , the document is a forgery .\nHowever , it is definitely intended to make it appear as though Forrestal was forced to leave because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a piece of misdirection , the document is not authentic .\nOf course , it is possible that the purpose was to confuse the public regarding Forrestal , aliens , and UFOs .\nHowever , we are certain that Forrestal was murdered : there are so many bizarre components to the entire affair .\nConcerning the UFO side of the narrative , nevertheless , much more evidence must be discovered to create a truly compelling case .", "author": "HAF", "url":

of that month that the World Health Organisation officially named the novel coronavirus disease Covid-19 .\nSo with this being the official truth , why does United States Government data show that the

was the entire contract awarded by the DOD to Black & Veatch Special Projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the \u2018 USA Spending \u2019 site actually reveal that the specific DOD department that awarded the contract was the Defense Threat Reduction Agency ( DTRA ) .\nThe contract was awarded 20th September 2012 , and concluded on 13th October 2020 .\nWhilst the details are vague , the US Government site also reveals that $ 21.7 million of the $ 116.6 million contract was spent on a \u2018 Biological threat reduction program in Ukraine \u2019 .\nWhy did the Department of Defense pay a company that is

\u2019 .\nDr Karen Saylors , Eco-Health Alliance and Metabiota worked together on the United States Agency for International Development ( USAID ) \u2018 PREDICT \u2019 program from 2009 , while Labyrinth Global Health worked alongside EHA and Metabiota on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2009 and funded by USAID , PREDICT was an early warning system for new and emerging diseases in 21 countries .\nIt was

PREDICT as having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveillance and laboratory diagnostic capabilities for both known and newly discovered viruses within several important virus groups , such as filoviruses ( including ebolaviruses ) , influenza viruses , paramyxoviruses , and coronaviruses \u201c .\nHere \u2019 s one of the many studies published by Eco Health Alliance , Metabiota and Labyrinth Global Health

including over 10,000 bats.\n\u201d A PREDICT-funded 2015 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bats \u201d also included Peter Daszak , president of EHA , among its participants .\nEco Health Alliance is listed as a partner

, Daszak and Zhengli were conducting research on SARS-like coronaviruses in bats .\nSeveral PREDICT-funded studies on SARS-like coronaviruses and Swine Flu count with both Zhengli \u2019 s and Daszak \u2019 s contributions .\nPerhaps the most noteworthy of these is a 2015 PREDICT and NIH-funded study she co-authored entitled : \u2018 A SARS-like cluster of circulating bat coronaviruses shows potential for human emergence \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founder of Metabiota and the non-profit Global Viral .\nHe spent over eight years conducting biomedical research in both sub-Saharan Africa and

until it was disbanded .\nAll of these people and organisations have been working for at least the last decade studying coronaviruses and helping to set up Biolabs in Ukraine .\nAll using US

detailed information about them .\nMany of his interviews focused on the impact that various extraterrestrial species have had on the human race .\nCollier is deemed believable by many well-known UFO enthusiasts , at least in the sense that he strives to relay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encounters with the Andromedans .\nFrom his earliest years as a child to the middle of his adolescence , he had regular encounters with extraterrestrial life .\nAfter a break of several years , during which he served as a helicopter pilot in the U.S. Army , the contact started up again in 1985 .\nWhen Collier encountered the two Andromedans , they became his mentors and brought him on board their spacecraft for a three-month period where they exposed Collier to the teachings of the Andromedans .\nThe

the Centers for Disease Creation ( CDC ) , the agency that created at least eight Genus categories of Pox Diseases , Monkeypox is called a \u201c rare disease.\n\u201d However , Monkeypox can not be considered \u201c rare , \u201d if the CDC also claims that Monkeypox is spreading .\nBefore anyone could say Monkeypox jjab patent , the U.S. government swooped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jjabs to treat both Monkeypox and Smallpox .\nAfter all , where there is a will , there is a jjab patent !\nIn February 2021 , patent application # 20210260182 was filed for RECOMBINANT POXVIRUS BASED VACCINE AGAINST SARS-CoV-2 VIRUS .\nThis is a combination pox/COVID jjab patent filed over a year ago : The terms \u201c chimeric \u201d or \u201c engineered \u201d or \u201c modified \u201d ( e.g.\n, chimeric poxvirus , engineered polypeptide , modified polypeptide , engineered nucleic acid , modified nucleic acid ) or grammatical variations thereof are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-native sequence that has been

992077-92610 ; SEQ ID NO : 1 ) of the horsepox virus or the synthetic horsepox virus .\nThen came the newly patented pox-combo Omicron jjab .\nOf course , other labs are developing tests for Monkeypox virus .\nGet read for the temperature checks .\nYou know the routine .\nThe official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monkeypox \u201d was discovered in 1958 \u201c when two outbreaks of a pox-like disease occurred in colonies of monkeys kept for research \u201d \u2026 and injected with Smallpox .\nNot too long ago , in 2018 , the Horsepox virus had its heyday when researchers told the story of the \u201d infectious virus \u201d synthesized in a lab .\nSymptoms may include a desire to neigh , snort , and gallop with the herd .\nBut seriously\u2026 Horsepox was said to be the cousin of the Smallpox virus , which health authorities claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1980 .\nWhy eradicate one \u201c deadly \u201d virus only to revive its cousin ?\nWhat is the purpose of Franken-science ?\nThe official answer was \u201c to develop cancer treatments and jjabs , \u201d especially since the current Smallpox jjab ( Variola ) has some serious adverse side effects , including death .\nNote : nothing is ever said about curing cancer , only about \u201c developing treatments and jjabs.\n\u201d From the 2018 paper , Synthetic viruses \u2014 Anything new ?\n: \u2026it comes as no surprise that it is possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DNA fragments .\nThe first synthetic virus , poliovirus , was produced by Wimmer and colleagues and made us aware of the fact that we entered a new era of reverse genetics that allows for the generation of synthetic viruses without the need for a nucleic acid template .\nMany scientific papers published since 2018 have questioned the wisdom of engineering viruses from deadly Smallpox , which they admit could lead to the reemergence of Smallpox , as well as to future pandemics .\nWhat if the lab-created monkey virus or the horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ?\nPreviously , scientists had blamed monkeys , as well as other species , for the consequences of their genetic experiments : in monkeys ( SV40 ) ; in pigs ( Swine flu ( H1N1 ) ) ; in birds ( Avian flu ( H5N1 ) different from Chickenpox ; and in insects ( Zika mosquito borne virus ) .\nNote : the same molecular signature , protein ( PB1-F2 ) , is present in both the 1918 Spanish flu virus and in the highly lethal h5N1 chicken viruses .\nCoincidence ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ become \u201c epidemics , \u201d only beta tests on behavioral dynamics ; except for the Swine Flu Epidemic , which resulted in a mass jjab campaign , and was subsequently repealed after widespread jjab injuries and deaths [ See my 2018 blog Beware the Horsepox Vaccine ! ]\n.\nWith many stories in the media , it is important to know that there is something called The Species Barrier .\nEven in the Age of Ignorance , the Species Barrier still exists , and The UK Dictionary defines it as : The natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from spreading from one species to another .\nIn short , people can not \u201c catch \u201d diseases from animals , birds , reptiles , insects , vegetables , or minerals .\nBut , as long as people have short attention spans , and continue to be misled by the story , animals will continue to be wrongly blamed and punished for human-engineered , chimeric experiments .\nWhy create animalpox outbreaks that appear go viral ?\nThe ultimate purpose of any \u201c viral threat \u201d is to roll out the \u201c jjab solution.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to push an agenda of jjabs ?\nTo engineer consent to reengineer humanity for deeper control : Monkey see-Monkey do .\nTherefore , any true global \u201c viral threat \u201d is not complete without a patented , engineered , controllable , injectable chimeric virus , coming soon to a city near you .\nThe media generates associations by first showing computer-generated images of microscopic cells that appear to be bacteria ( not viruses ) .\nThen , they release images of raised blisters or a rash labelled as \u201c Monkeypox.\n\u201d Looking closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could double as an image labelled Shingles .\nIs there a relationship between the pox and the rash , or is it between the COVID jjab/boosters and the rash ?\nBecause the world complied so quickly to the illegal Coronavirus countermeasures , brought on by governments around the world , there is no need to wait years for the next epidemic !\nThe \u201c flying monkeys \u201d are here to do the bidding of their creators .\nWill Monkeypox parties be next ?\nWhat the WHO and CDC have not disclosed is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rashes , often a full body rash .\nA jjab-associated rash is a consequence of an influx of toxins to the body that results in a suppressed immune system .\nFrequent Strep Throat infections are another indication of a suppressed immune system .\nA.S.I.A is not a continent when it comes to jjab damage .\nA.S.I.A is Autoimmune/Inflammatory Syndrome Induced by Adjuvants , ( ie , induced by toxins ) , where adjuvants are jjab ingredients ( eg .\naluminum sulphate ) .\nKeep this in mind .\nDo your own research .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ rash was not indicated as a symptom of \u201c Coronavirus , \u201d which is a family of cold/flu viruses .\nAccording to officials , Coronaviruses can produce runny nose , sore throat , headache , fever , cough , and a general feeling of being unwell .\nTrue viruses , those not engineered in a lab , can not survive outside the cell , they can not transmit an infection because they are not alive ( like bacteria ) .\nIn this way , viruses are exosomes , produced by the cell in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help to clean the cell to regain balance and health .\nExosome biogenesis is a mechanism of protein quality control , and once released , exosomes have activities as diverse as remodeling the extracellular matrix and transmitting signals and molecules to other cells .\nThis pathway of intercellular vesicle traffic plays important roles in many aspects of human health and disease , including development , immunity , tissue homeostasis , cancer , and neurodegenerative diseases .\nSearch \u201c Exosome \u201d on Pubmed and find more than 23,000 results .\nIf we search results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a hundred studies are revealed .\nSearch and find the same trend for Measles Vaccine-Associated Rash Illness , MMR Vaccine-Associated Rash Illness , and Shingrix for Herpes Vaccine .\nJust know that Shingles can result from the Shingles jjab , just like COVID can result after the COVID jjab , just like Measles rash and Mumps can result from the MMR jjab .\nWith so many contradictions in the story , did someone forget to edit ?\nThe World Health Organization ( WHO ) claims the Monkeypox \u201c outbreak \u201d is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendations based on only \u201c 3 possible cases \u201d of rash in the U.S. Other countries are reporting their own rashes .\nToday , 19 countries are tracking and reporting Monkeypox numbers ; similar to the Coronavirus protocol .\nSome countries are already urging people to self-isolate .\nIs Monkeypox a runaway train before it got started ?\nMore contradictions : some countries claim the pox spreads through respiratory droplets , while other reports claim the Monkeypox spreads through sex , with specific warnings that target gay and bisexual men .\nWhich is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the virus itself is not a sexually transmitted infection , which are generally spread through semen and vaginal fluids , the most recent surge in cases appears to have been spread among men who have sex with other men , WHO officials said , emphasizing that anyone can contract monkeypox .\nIs that science or science fiction ?\nAre we back to HIV-AIDS ?\nDid we ever leave it ?\nWas the HIV virus \u201c discovered \u201d in 1984 by Dr. Robert Gallo so he could develop a jjab decades later when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nRecall , in the 1980s , after the 1976 Swine flu Fiasco , jjab hesitancy would have stopped people from accepting mass experimental jjab campaigns .\nWithout jjab hesitancy , bring on the HIV injections that can be taken two months apart !\nAny injection , jjab or experimental , should be documented as safe before use .\nHowever , since 1986 , jjab makers have been off the hook for damages from their products .\nIf jjab makers do not stand behind their products why should anyone else ?\nAnother contradiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been isolated or proven to exist as a pathogen .\nHowever , according to the 2003 British Medical Journal , fragments of DNA identical to that of \u2018 HIV \u2019 are found in all human beings .\nFor more backstory on HIV-AIDS story , read the 2014 article , Questioning the HIV-AIDS Hypothesis : 30 years of dissent .\n\u201c The HIV/AIDS hypothesis is one hellof a mistake \u201d - Kary Mullis , 1996 , p. 14..\u2013 Nobel Laureate in Chemistry , 1993 , inventor of PCR test .\nWith so many stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scene as a hoax ?\nA test of humanity ?\nAnother virus that divides and discriminates against bisexual and gay men ?\nWhat about the devastation of 500,000 deaths caused by the prescription Opioid Epidemic from 1999 to 2019 that continue ?\nWhat about more than 150 people who die each year from taking the OTC , FDA-approved drug Tylenol ?\nNature has always ruled and Nature will continue to rule , but only if Nature \u2019 s Law is followed

, the USA and Australia are intended to rile the public into another fear-fueled frenzy in order to justify the World Health Organization \u2019 s takeover of public health globally , and usher in the reviled health passports alongside everything else that comes with The Great Reset .\nAs predicted , just as hysteria about COVID-19 is winding down , another \u201c pandemic \u201d is poised to take its place .\nThis time , it \u2019 s monkeypox , an infection that just so happens to mimic many of the symptoms of COVID jab-induced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department of Health in Queensland , Australia , used the same photo to illustrate both infections ( the photos have since been removed or updated1 ) .\nThe first European case of monkeypox was confirmed May 7 , 2022 , in the U.K.2 Then , seemingly overnight , cases were being reported across the world.3 May 20 , 2022 , the World Health Organization held an emergency meeting to discuss reports of more than 100 suspected or confirmed cases in at least nine countries , including Belgium , France , Germany , Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sweden , the U.K. , the U.S. , Canada and Australia.4 By the time this article goes to print , the number of countries affected and the case load totals are likely going to be significantly higher .\nThe first case in the U.S. was reported May 18 , 2022.5 By May 23 , suspected monkeypox cases were reported in three additional states : New York , Florida and Utah.6 All of the patients were said to be in good condition and state health departments were in agreement that the cases posed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Joe Biden has stated that strict quarantine protocols are not likely to be implemented in the U.S .\nHe has , however , already placed a $ 119 million order for a monkeypox jjab.7,8 Belgium , meanwhile , has introduced a 21-day quarantine for anyone who tests positive , and the U.K. is urging anyone who has had direct contact with a confirmed case to voluntarily isolate for 21 days.9 As noted by Jimmy Dore in the video below , the worldwide monkeypox outbreak seems perfectly timed to pressure countries to relinquish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The World Health Assembly was voting on amendments to the International Health Regulations ( IHR ) 10 as the first cases were being identified .\nI discussed the implications of these amendments in a recent article .\nAs noted by Dore , a pandemic rehearsal conducted just last year also featured monkeypox specifically .\nI \u2019 ll review that further below .\nMonkeypox , a relative of the smallpox virus , is a typically mild viral illness , characterized by fever , headache , muscle aches , exhaustion , swollen lymph nodes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the face before spreading to other parts of the body .\nThe pus-filled lesions are known as \u201c pox.\n\u201d The lesions eventually scab over and fall off after three to four weeks .\nThe infection is not readily transmissible , as it requires direct contact with bodily fluids .\nWhile there \u2019 s no known effective treatment , most patients recover without any treatment whatsoever .\nHistorically , the infection has primarily plagued the African continent , where a few thousand cases are reported each year .\nHowever , many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel , making the outbreak in so many different areas a rare oddity .\nAs noted by Nature magazine:11 \u201c On 19 May , researchers in Portugal uploaded the first draft genome12 of the monkeypox virus that was detected there , but Gustavo Palacios , a virologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City , emphasizes that it \u2019 s still a very early draft , and more work needs to be done before any definitive conclusions can be drawn .\nWhat researchers can tell from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the monkeypox virus found in Portugal is related to a viral strain predominantly found in West Africa .\nThis strain causes milder disease and has a lower death rate \u2014 about 1 % in poor rural populations \u2014 compared with the one that circulates in Central Africa .\nBut exactly how much the strain causing the current outbreaks differs from the one in West Africa \u2014 and whether the cases popping up in various countries are linked to one another \u2014 remains unknown.\n\u201d Several of the Spanish cases were linked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sauna \u201d in Madrid , at least three Belgian cases were linked to a gay fetish festival in Antwerp,13 and cases in Italy and Tenerife have been linked to a gay pride festival on the Canary Islands.14 Health officials also claim a \u201c notable proportion \u201d of British cases are in the gay and bisexual community.15,16 Is the singling out of gays another ploy in the totalitarian takeover plan ?\nTotalitarian regimes always need an enemy onto which the fear and irrational aggression of the hypnotized masses can be directed , and since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jab has significantly abated , they clearly need a new scapegoat .\nIt would not surprise me if , after two years of promoting the gay and trans community , the far Left will now begin to incite anger and fear against it .\nWhy ?\nBecause it causes confusion and uncertainty .\nPeople who once showed allegiance with this group will now be splintered against them .\nAt the end of the day , it \u2019 s all about psychological splintering and pitting various groups against each other .\nIt appears the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promote The Great Reset in other ways .\nAlready , U.K. health officials are warning the monkeypox virus may spread through consumption of infected meat,17 and we already know that eliminating meat consumption is part of the globalist agenda .\nAccording to the World Economic Founder , meat will be \u201c an occasional treat , not a staple , for the good of the environment and our health.\n\u201d \u2013 Read more on the subject HERE and HERE .\nMaking the monkeypox outbreaks all the more suspicious is the fact that a tabletop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in March 2021,18 and the start date of this fictional scenario was mid-May 2022 .\nCoincidence ?\nIn the video above , AmazingPolly reviews the details of this simulation .\nShe also reminds us how Event 201 ended up \u201c predicting \u201d the COVID pandemic to a tee , and shows how we \u2019 re now seeing a replay of \u201c coincidences \u201d between the monkeypox simulation and real-world events .\nThe monkeypox exercise was held by the Nuclear Threat Initiative ( NTI ) , which is funded by Billy Boy .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ threats associated with the proliferation of nuclear weapons,19 but they \u2019 ve since expanded to include biological threats.20 Gates has not only funded NTI pandemic simulations but has also given grants to the NTI for jjab development in relation to biological threats.21 The final report22,23 from this event was funded by the Open Philanthropy project , which in turn is funded by Facebook cofounder Dustin Moscowitz .\nAs reported by The Defender:24 \u201c This \u2018 fictional exercise scenario \u2019 involved the simulation of \u2018 a deadly , global pandemic involving an unusual strain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fictional nation of Brinia and spread globally over 18 months \u2019 \u2026 The outcome of this \u2018 exercise scenario \u2019 found the fictional pandemic , \u2018 caused by a terrorist attack using a pathogen engineered in a laboratory with inadequate biosafety and biosecurity provisions and weak oversight , \u2019 led to \u2018 more than three billion cases and 270 million fatalities worldwide.\n\u2019 The fictional start date of the monkeypox pandemic in this exercise was May 15 , 2022 .\nThe first European case of monkeypox was identified on May 7 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European case of monkeypox was in fact confirmed May 7 , 2022 , in the U.K.25 Not only is the date identical to that in this supposedly fictional scenario , but the country of emergence , \u201c Brinia , \u201d even sounds very much like \u201c Britannica , \u201d or \u201c Great Britain.\n\u201d Coincidence ?\nAs reported by The Defender , among the key recommendations from this monkeypox simulation were recommendations that clearly support the WHO \u2019 s takeover of pandemic preparedness and response , and the implementation of Gates \u2019 \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GERM26 ) Team:27 \u2022 Bolstering international systems \u201c for pandemic risk assessment , warning , and investigating outbreak origins , \u201d calling upon the WHO to \u201c establish a graded , transparent , international public health alert system \u201d and the United Nations system to \u201c establish a new mechanism for investigating high-consequence biological events of unknown origin.\n\u201d \u2022 The development and implementation of \u201c national-level triggers for early , proactive pandemic response , \u201d including the adaptation of the \u201c no-regrets \u201d approach to responding to pandemics via \u201c anticipatory action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would automatically generate a response to \u201c high-consequence biological events.\n\u201d \u2022 The establishment of \u201c an international entity dedicated to reducing emerging biological risks associated with rapid technology advances , \u201d that would \u201c support interventions throughout the bioscience and biotechnology research and development life cycle \u2014 from funding , through

banning of mass gatherings , travel health screening and jjab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these strategies are ineffective at best , while being devastating to public health and economies .\nWhy Does Fiction so Often Turn Into Reality ?\nAs noted by The Defender,28 Michael P. Sanger29 and Tim Hinchliffe,30 among others , fictional tabletop exercises have had an uncanny ability to predict details of near-future events .\nEvent 201 accurately \u201c predicted \u201d the COVID pandemic and its focus on censorship and lockdowns .\nIn June 2001 , Operation Dark Winter examined \u201c the national security , intergovernmental , and information challenges of a biological attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than three months later , the 9/11 attacks and subsequent anthrax scare occurred .\nIn January 2005 , Operation Atlantic Storm involved the fictional scenario of a transatlantic bioterrorist attack and that same month we had the bird flu pandemic .\nThe Defender continues:31 \u201c Predictions for the future don \u2019 t end there , however .\nFor instance , in September 2017 , NTI and the WEF organized a roundtable discussion on the current state of biological risks presented by technology advancement in light of the Fourth Industrial Revolution .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WEF again joined forces , issuing a report titled \u2018 Biosecurity Innovation and Risk Reduction : A Global Framework for Accessible , Safe and Secure DNA Synthesis.\n\u2019 According to the report : \u2018 Rapid advancements in commercially available DNA synthesis technologies \u2014 used for example to artificially create gene sequences for clinical diagnosis and treatment \u2014 pose growing risks , with the potential to cause a catastrophic biological security threat if accidentally or deliberately misused.\n\u2019 Merck , whose head of corporate affairs participated in the monkeypox simulation , was the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November 2021 regarding 15 suspicious vials labeled \u201c smallpox \u201d at a Merck facility in Philadelphia.\n\u201d In a National Pulse exclusive,32 Natalie Winters also summarizes research by the Wuhan Institute of Virology ( WIV ) , in which they \u201c assembled monkeypox strains using methods flagged for creating \u2018 contagious pathogens.\n\u2019 \u201d \u201c Are we here because of China \u2019 s experiments again ?\n\u201d she asks , referring to the apparent monkeypox outbreaks .\nThe research paper33 in question was

Europe is not specific for the monkeypox .\nIt \u2019 s actually a smallpox jjab , claimed to be 85 % effective at stopping monkeypox .\nIn the U.K. , close contacts of those infected with monkeypox have reportedly already been given the smallpox jjab \u2014 a strategy known as \u201c ring vaccination.\n\u201d 34 In the U.S. , there are currently two smallpox jjabs available : \u2022 ACAM2000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drug Administration in 2007 and has primarily been restricted to use in military personnel due to its safety risks , which include infection with the jjab strain , jjab shedding and death .\nPackage insert warnings include myocarditis and pericarditis at a rate of 5.7 per 1,000 vaccinated , encephalitis , severe skin infection , blindness , fetal death and more .\nHousehold contacts face the same risks as the vaccinated individual due to shedding .\n\u2022 Jynneos ( known as Imvamune in Canada or Imvanex in Europe35 ) was approved by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attenuated live jjab , indicated for the prevention of smallpox and monkeypox in adults aged 18 and older , and those who can not be vaccinated with ACAM2000 due to contraindications such as atopic dermatitis , immunocompromising conditions , breastfeeding or pregnancy .\nIt \u2019 s the only FDA-approved monkeypox jjab for non-military use .\nThe U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority ( BARDA ) has also signed a contract with Bavarian Nordic for a freeze-dried version of the Jynneos smallpox jjab , which will give it longer shelf-life.36 Moderna already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It \u2019 s unclear when those trials began .\nAs noted by independent journalist Whitney Webb , Emergent BioSolutions and SIGA Technologies \u2014 both of which have been struggling recently \u2014 will be cashing in on the monkeypox scare:38 \u201c Regardless of how the monkeypox situation plays out , two companies are already cashing in .\nAs concern over monkeypox has risen , so too have the shares of Emergent BioSolutions and SIGA Technologies .\nBoth companies essentially have monopolies in the U.S. market , and other markets as well , on smallpox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products are , conveniently , also used to protect against or treat monkeypox as well .\nAs a result , the shares of Emergent BioSolutions climbed 12 % on Thursday , while those of SIGA soared 17.1 % .\nFor these companies , the monkeypox fears are a godsend , specifically for SIGA , which produces a smallpox treatment , known by its brand name TPOXX .\nIt is SIGA \u2019 s only product .\nWhile some outlets have noted that the rise in the valuation of SIGA Technologies has coincided with recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been given to the fact that the company is apparently the only piece of a powerful billionaire \u2019 s empire that isn \u2019 t currently crumbling .\nThat billionaire , \u2018 corporate raider \u2019 Ron Perelman , has deep and controversial ties to the Clinton family and the Democratic party as well as troubling ties to Jeffery Epstein .\nAside from his controlling stake in SIGA , Perelman has recently made headlines for rapidly liquidating many of his assets in a desperate bid for cash .\nSimilarly , Emergent BioSolutions has also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has troubling ties to the 2001 Anthrax attacks , came under fire just under two weeks ago for engaging in a \u2018 cover-up \u2019 over quality control issues relating to their production of COVID-19 jjabs .\nA Congressional investigation found that quality control concerns at an Emergent-run facility led to more than 400 million doses of COVID-19 jjabs being discarded .\nThe Emergent factory in question had been shut down by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) in April 2021 .\nThey were allowed to reopen last August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What \u2019 s the Truth of the Matter ?\nIn addition to Webb \u2019 s article above , which dissects the sordid histories of Emergent and SIGA , another early analysis of the new monkeypox scare that is well worth reading is Dr. Robert Malone \u2019 s Substack article,39 \u201c Monkey Pox \u2014 Truth Versus Fearporn.\n\u201d In it , he reviews what monkeypox actually is , where it came from , how it \u2019 s related to smallpox , it \u2019 s signs and symptoms , how disease spread is effectively controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been some genetic alteration , either through evolution or intentional genetic manipulation , [ monkeypox ] is not a significant biothreat , and has never been considered a high threat pathogen in the past .\nSo , stop the fear mongering , misinformation and disinformation.\n\u201d ~ Dr. Robert Malone Key take-home \u2019 s are that monkeypox is not a particularly deadly disease and one that can be readily controlled without reverting back to COVID restrictions .\nTo quote Malone:40 \u201c So , is the biothreat real ?\nIs it imminent ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nAs I was waiting in an airport lounge to travel from USA to the UK two days ago , I saw a newsreel from CNN which was breathlessly reporting on this \u2018 threat \u2019 while displaying historic images of patients suffering from Smallpox disease .\nThis provides a classical example of public health fearporn , in my opinion , and CNN should be reprimanded for broadcasting irresponsible propaganda \u2014 misinformation and disinformation \u2014 under the guise of journalism .\nIn my opinion , based on currently available information , Monkeypox is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa , emerges sporadically after transmission into humans from animal hosts , and is typically spread by close human contact .\nIt is readily controlled by classical public health measures .\nIt does not have a high mortality rate .\nUnless there has been some genetic alteration , either through evolution or intentional genetic manipulation , it is not a significant biothreat , and has never been considered a high threat pathogen in the past .\nSo , stop the fear mongering , misinformation and disinformation.\n\u201d The way it looks right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended to rile the public into another fear-fueled frenzy in order to justify the WHO \u2019 s takeover of public health globally , usher in those reviled health passports and everything else that goes along with The Great Reset .\nAs noted by Hinchliffe in a 2020 Sociable article:41 \u201c If you are World

crazy .\nHere is the first on the list .\nThe least one can say is that Klaus Schwab , the founder and the head of the WEF is not a fan of democracy .\nHe perceives it as an obstacle to a fully globalized world .\nIn the 2010 WEF report titled \u201c Global Redesign \u201d , Schwab postulates that a globalized world is best managed by a \u201c self-selected coalition of multinational corporations , governments ( including through the UN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizations ( CSOs ) \u201d .\nThis is the exact opposite of a democracy .\nHe argued that governments are no longer \u201c the overwhelmingly dominant actors on the world stage \u201d and that \u201c the time has come for a new stakeholder paradigm of international governance \u201d .\nFor this reason , the Transnational Institute ( \u201c TNI \u201d ) described WEF as \u201c a silent global coup d \u2019 \u00e9tat \u201d to capture governance .\nIn 2017 , at Harvard \u2019 s John F.

@ @ @ @ @ @ Canada \u2019 s cabinet consists of representatives sold to WEF \u2019 s agenda .\nThis is not a \u201c conspiracy theory.\n\u201d This is the absolute truth , confirmed by the head of WEF himself .\nIn March 2022 , Australian Senator Alex Antic warned the Senate that WEF was penetrating governments around the world to subvert Western values and cited Schwab \u2019 s 2017 Harvard discussion during which Schwab said : \u201c I know that half of this [ Canadian ] cabinet , even more than half , are Young Global Leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s true in Argentina , it \u2019 s true in France .\nNow with the president who is a Young Global Leader.\n\u201d Added to Schwab \u2019 s remarks in the video below is a clip from the Canadian Parliament .\nIn mid-February , Collin Carrie MP raised WEF \u2019 s influence in Canadian politics .\nThe Speaker cut Carrie short saying the audio was \u201c really , really bad and the video was as well \u201d and moved on to the next item of

Other \u2018 Elites \u2019 .\nSchwab again boasted about WEF \u2019 s infiltration of governments at Davos 2020 .\nSpeaking to Costa Rica \u2019 s President Carlos Alvarado Quesada , Schwab listed former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin as former WEF Young Global Leaders .\nThe Malone Institute , in collaboration with the Pharos Foundation and

sustainable development agenda for a long time , and as soon as the same people who were promoting climate alarmism jumped on the COVID train , he knew they were connected , and that COVID was going to be used to promote the technocratic agenda .\nThe same flawed computer models used to convince us climate change will kill us all were also used to incite panic about the lethality of COVID .\nThese computer models are basically rigged to say whatever they want them to say .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have been wiped off the face of the earth 10 years ago .\nYet here we are .\nThe COVID models also failed , missing the mark by miles .\n\u201c At the time [ in early 2020 ] , I said this is technocracy \u2019 s coup d \u2019 \u00e9tat .\nThey \u2019 re finally making their major global move to do what they said they were going to do for a long time .\nNow , they \u2019 re actually putting shoe leather to it and they \u2019 re making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coup d \u2019 \u00e9tat early on , \u201d Wood says .\nUnfortunately , to quote Wood \u2019 s coauthor of previous books , Anthony Sutton , only 2 % of people have critical thinking skills , 8 % of people think they can think , and 90 % would rather die than think .\nThis willful ignorance explains why only 10 % of a given population , on average , does not fall into mass formation hypnosis .\nWood , along with Dr. Judy Mikovits and Dr. Reiner Fuellmich , an international lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2014 have formed the Crimes Against Humanity Task Force .\nThe first event will be held in Tampa , FL with guest speaker , Michael Yeadon , Ph.D.. \u201c We believe there is a great case to be made that , indeed , crimes against humanity have been committed in the same context and sense that they were discovered at the Nuremberg trials that produced the Nuremberg Code , which is now embedded in the legal system in every nation on earth , [ including ] our country and every state as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and yet it has happened anyway , with no informed consent along the way .\nPeople are getting sick and dying , the same old drill .\nWhat went wrong ?\nWe \u2019 re presenting this case to the American public in person , and I will say the dynamic of talking to a live audience today is a breath of fresh air for me , personally .\nI think everybody else would say the same thing.\n\u201d Creating a New Normal on Our Own Terms While many resist this stance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not over , and it \u2019 s not going to right itself .\nNo .\nIt \u2019 ll get worse , and things will never go back to the way they were .\nIt \u2019 s important to realize that we shouldn \u2019 t want things to go back to the old normal , however .\nBecause the old normal is what precipitated the many crises we \u2019 re currently facing .\nWe can fully expect that the partially failed jjab passport will be replaced by digital identity , which will progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CBDC ) .\nMost central banks in the world will be rolling out CBDCs within the next three to five years .\nDigital identity and CBDCs are a disaster racing toward us like a freight train , and it \u2019 ll be extremely difficult to get out of harms way .\nThe past two years will seem like a picnic compared to what \u2019 s coming .\n\u201c If my hypothesis is true , January 2020 was the coup d \u2019 \u00e9tat that started this war in earnest , the hot war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to it .\nLots of bad stuff happened from 9/11 through 2020 that we could point to and say , it looks like somebody \u2019 s orchestrating this , but it went into a hot war , literally , globally as well , in January 2020 .\nRevolutions never stop with one attack .\nThat \u2019 s obvious .\nI \u2019 m sure it \u2019 s self-evident.\n\u201d By Their Words and Actions , You Can Know Them So , who instigated this global revolution ?\nWho \u2019 s pulling the strings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nIt \u2019 s not the populace .\nIt \u2019 s not even a specific nation .\nIt \u2019 s a conglomerate of wealthy and influential people all over the world .\nBut they have a shared philosophy , ideology and agenda .\nWood explains : \u201c What \u2019 s going on is called The Great Reset of the planet .\nThe Great Reset has become a catchphrase .\nMost people don \u2019 t have a clue what it means yet , but it \u2019 s promoted by the World Economic Forum ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and coupled with the United Nations .\nThis elite group of people represent in mix all of the people that were originally in the Trilateral Commission back in the 1970s .\nIt \u2019 s the same kinds of people , the same agenda to transform the world into their vision , the way they think things ought to be .\nThese are the people that have orchestrated this whole thing and they \u2019 re the ones that are pushing it right now .\nIt \u2019 s easy to identify most of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Klaus Schwabs and the Billy Boyes [ of the world ] , and the thousand companies that belong to the World Economic Forum .\nThey all have CEOs , board members , et cetera , that are part of the World Economic Forum .\nIt \u2019 s pretty easy to identify them today .\nThe idea of The Great Reset is complete transformation of society and individuals that live in this society .\nThe World Economic Forum is boldly talking about both .\nThey talk about this technocratic takeover on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the structures of society , the institutions , but they also talk about the restructuring of humanity itself .\nThat is , the merging of technology with the human condition , with the flesh , the changing of genetic code , Humanity 2.0 , H+ is another term is used .\nThis is mad scientist type of stuff .\nThe average guy on the street has never been exposed to this .\nIt \u2019 s hard to get your head around how evil this whole thing is , and it \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they just did it .\nThat \u2019 s another thing that \u2019 s really important to understand : This didn \u2019 t just come out of the blue or fall out of the sky from outer space .\nThis has been in the works for a very long time.\n\u201d In 1992 , Agenda 21 was created .\nThat was the genesis of sustainable development .\nThat \u2019 s where that doctrine was openly described .\nThe Agenda 21 and the Biodiversity Convention that took place at the same time was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Wood , Agenda 21 was foundational in the sense that laid out all the events being rolled out and changes being implemented today .\nIt \u2019 s just that no one was really paying attention to where things were headed , the ultimate implications of it all .\nOf course , those who did see the writing on the wall were discredited as \u201c crazy conspiracy theorists.\n\u201d \u201c There was a great book released in 1994 called \u2018 The Earth Brokers.\n\u2019 The two authors were scholars .\nThey were also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t on our side necessarily , but they went to the Agenda 21 conference in good faith , figuring there was going to be some negotiation to dial back the development that was messing with the Third World and try to get the planet back together .\nThey went hoping to turn some things around , and they came away from the Agenda 21 conference completely disillusioned \u2026 In that book , they criticized the Agenda 21 process .\nThey started out by saying something like this : \u2018 We argue that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic development \u2014 has boosted precisely the type of industrial development that is destructive for the environment , the planet and its inhabitants .\nWe see how , as a result of USAID , the rich would get richer , the poor poorer , while more and more of the planet is destroyed in the process.\n\u2019 What can we say , but \u2018 amen \u2019 to that .\nHere we are today .\nIt \u2019 s exactly what \u2019 s happened.\n\u201d The Plan to Own and Control All Life \u201c The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned from the Biodiversity Convention , which ran parallel with the Agenda 21 conference .\nIt had the same participants , just two different thought tracks brought together at the same conference .\n\u201c They wrote about the biodiversity convention , which has become incredibly important today to the United Nations .\nThey said the convention implicitly equates the diversity of life , that is animals and plants , to the diversity of genetic codes .\nBy doing so , diversity becomes something modern science can manipulate .\nIt promotes biotechnology as being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of biodiversity .\nThey redefined the term biodiversity , for one , but they also said the main stake raised by the biodiversity convention is the issue of ownership and control over biological diversity .\nThe major concern was protecting the pharmaceutical and emerging biotechnology industries .\nThat was their assessment .\nTo which , today , we can say , \u2018 Bingo !\n\u2019 That is exactly what happened back then , and this is exactly the expression today that we see of the genetic takeover of life on planet earth .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ they \u2019 ve gotten the plants , they \u2019 ve gotten the animals.\n\u201d Today , the technocrats are also moving in on the human genetic code .\nChief medical officer of Moderna , Tal Zaks , for example , has stated that Moderna , a developer of the mRNA COVID jab , is \u201c hacking the software of life.\n\u201d He described the human genetic code as an operating system , and if you can change that operating system by introducing a new line of code , or by changing a line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operating system functions .\nSince 1992 , legislation has been created to protect Big Pharma .\nYou could say the 1992 Agenda 21 was a pre-coup .\nThey laid the groundwork back then to protect the pharmaceutical and emerging biotech industries they knew were coming .\nAnd , today , the very genetic makeup of mankind is up for grabs .\nTechnocracy dates further back than the 90s , however .\nHandwritten letters dating to the 1930s reveal some of the originators of the technocratic movement had gotten into an argument with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that , they forbade journalists to discuss them or the technocratic ideology .\nHence , technocracy went underground and got sort of buried for a few decades .\nWood explains : \u201c What happened was , Howard Scott , one of the cofounders of Technocracy Inc. , was also the leader of the group at Columbia University when it was housed there in 1932 .\nHe had promoted himself as being a certified engineer and one of the intellectual guys that would fit in to Columbia University .\nHe wasn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the [ technocratic ] movement there .\nIt was discovered , while he was there , that he was a complete fraud .\nHe had no engineering degree at all .\nHe was just a blowhard .\nHe was a promoter \u2014 basically a con man \u2014 and Nicholas Murray Butler , the president of Columbia \u2026 flipped out , and drop-kicked Scott out of Columbia \u2026 By the same token , Howard Scott was out working in the media like crazy , and he worked the Hearst empire to get articles about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Randolph Hearst discovered , as Butler did , that he had been taken for a ride and that his media empire had been manipulated , he freaked out and sent out a telegram-type memo to every newspaper in the country , saying , \u2018 If anybody ever mentions technocracy again , you \u2019 re fired.\n\u2019 Well , that took care of that .\nHistory books have a 25-year lag , typically .\nHistorians don \u2019 t go back and analyze stuff from last year to write in history books .\nThey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around and they read the newspaper articles and whatever , and try and figure out what happened .\nThat \u2019 s how they write history .\nWell , there \u2019 s this huge hole on the technocracy movement because it just got dropped out .\nAll of a sudden , there \u2019 s no newspaper articles .\nIt \u2019 s just like they disappeared into thin air .\nThe big , highly credentialed scientist and engineers at Columbia who were crowing about technocracy the year before , now , all of a sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Wood eventually discovered a major university archive at University of Edmonton in Alberta , where all of the leaders of the Canadian technocracy movement had combined their papers in the \u2019 90s .\nThe documents were placed in a warehouse where they sat for years on end , until a catalog of them was finally published on the internet .\nIt was a real jackpot .\nWood and his wife drove to Edmonton and spent a week sifting through and copying materials .\nAfter that , it wasn \u2019 t very difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been moved forward and was being implemented .\nWhile the outward expression of technocracy will appear as totalitarianism , the control center is not a dictator .\nRather than a single person ruling by the decree , technocracy relies on control through technology and algorithm .\nThis is a very important difference .\nIn short , there are no people behind the curtain pulling strings .\nThere \u2019 s no individual to blame or hold accountable .\nThe \u201c dictator \u201d is an algorithm .\nLooking at Google over the past couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see this in action .\nWe can also see it in the censorship of social media , and in the social credit system in China .\n\u201c The so-called artificial intelligence boom has created the possibility of controlling people by algorithm , rather than by political dictate , \u201d Wood says .\n\u201c There has been a battle between technocrats and governments ever since technocracy started .\nBack in the day , they hated government .\nThey wanted to get rid of government .\nThere is still that propensity today .\nYou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you see it at United Nations .\nThey want to dissolve the national governments of the world .\nHistorically , fascism and communism have been instituted by national governments .\nThese entities are on the hit list for technocracy .\nWe saw this , by the way , just recently .\nThere was a conference in Dubai , called the World Government Summit1 [ March 29-30 , 2022 ] .\nIt was partly put on by the United Nations and there were a bunch of financial mucky mucks there .\nThere was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she \u2019 s from America , but she \u2019 s in Great Britain \u2014 and she does financial wealth management services for the ultra rich .\nShe talked about the destruction of the fiat currency system , and she said , when it happens , there \u2019 s simply going to be a change-over .\nAll the fiat currencies are going to go , and there \u2019 s going to be an implementation of digital currency .\nBut she also made point that the nation state structures of the world are declining rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the nation states are the target of destruction .\nThey must go.\n\u201d This has been in the works for some time .\nLook at the European Union .\nWhile Europe has country borders , the EU member states have virtually no power to do anything anymore .\nThey \u2019 re subservient to the EU \u2019 s wishes .\n\u201c That \u2019 s why a lot of people in Europe call the EU a technocracy , they \u2019 re a bunch of technocrat elites \u2014 they \u2019 re unelected , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNobody can get to them and they \u2019 re making decisions for everybody else .\nSo , while the nation states are still there in name , they \u2019 ve stripped of their sovereignty .\nThe World Health Organization is now also in the process of stripping nations of their sovereignty through the so-called Pandemic Treaty , which will grant the WHO unprecedented power and influence to govern behind the veil of \u201c global biosecurity.\n\u201d We also see the rule of technocracy in companies such as Google , which is meddling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wielding more power over people than the state itself .\nSo , it \u2019 s important to realize that the enemy is not a nation state .\nToday \u2019 s enemy can not be compared to anything that nation states have produced in the past , such as fascism , communism or socialism .\nThis is an altogether brand-new entity .\nSo , while technocracy feels like totalitarianism , today \u2019 s totalitarianism is an outgrowth of technocracy , and can not be compared to any previous totalitarian regime .\n\u201c If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the takeover genetic material on earth , this is the dangerous payload that we face .\nIt \u2019 s not just the governance part of it .\nIt \u2019 s not just the scientific dictatorship part of it , where people now can be manipulated in doing things that don \u2019 t want to do .\nWe \u2019 re talking about the direct takeover of the human genome .\nThis is an incredible thing , because that means , potentially , that our genome of humanity could be changed , \u201d Wood warns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , and indeed probable , that the orchestrators of this technocratic takeover are in over their heads and will end up self-destructing .\nThey \u2019 re playing a game that has never been played before , so there \u2019 s no telling what unintended consequences might be initiated .\nOne such unintended consequence could be a world war , and if that happens , gene editing the human genome will become irrelevant , because the living standards of the whole world will be pushed back hundreds of years .\nWood comments : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War III or a world war is going to be triggered .\nIt \u2019 s not in the best interest , for instance , for the World Economic Forum to have a world war .\nBut that doesn \u2019 t mean it won \u2019 t happen either .\nSo far , I think the Ukraine war is pretty orchestrated and scripted in many ways to the agenda of the World Economic Forum .\nBut it doesn \u2019 t mean it couldn \u2019 t lose control and the thing just goes nuts .\nIf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know where I \u2019 d put that on the doomsday clock .\nI \u2019 m not really sure , but it is definitely a possible outcome .\nIf it does happen , it will spoil everything for everyone for a very long period of time .\nAs the Bible says , it \u2019 ll take seven years to go through the countryside and bury all the radioactive bones .\nThat \u2019 d be very ugly .\nIt might not be [ a nuclear war ] .\nBut it could be .\nThey have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look what they can do by launching these pandemics and these bioweapons \u2026 Another thing that can happen \u2014 and again , we \u2019 re talking about waves of attacks , things that could bring us down and bring about this Great Reset \u2014 is some type of a cyber attack .\nThis has been in the news a lot lately .\nA cyber attack could be a false flag operation , but it doesn \u2019 t really matter what it is , whether it is or isn \u2019 t [ a false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like taking down the power grid , or taking down JPMorgan Chase and nobody can get their money out for a period of a week .\nSomething like that would , again , put the fear of God into everybody .\nWe \u2019 ll be back to the fear and panic ; we \u2019 ll do whatever you say to get safety , et cetera .\nIt will perpetuate the takeover , the coup that we \u2019 re looking at .\nThese are two possibilities , near-term , that are very real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now , but we know where this group of technocrat actors are going .\nWe understand their mindset , their philosophy , if you will .\nI hate to even call it that , but what is in their head ?\nThere \u2019 s no passion , there \u2019 s no compassion , there \u2019 s no love , there \u2019 s no mercy , there \u2019 s no grace , there \u2019 s nothing like that .\nIt \u2019 s a completely inhuman endeavor to capture mankind into a scientific dictatorship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has never seen before.\n\u201d Preparing Can Help Ease Your Anxiety The Boy Scouts motto is \u201c Be prepared , \u201d and that is what I would encourage everyone to strive for at this time .\nAnother motto to embrace would be \u201c Hope for the best and prepare for the worst.\n\u201d Prepare as best you can for any and every contingency .\nIf you can , get out of the big cities and big urban areas .\nRural areas where you can build community is your safest bet .\nPrepare for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSecure a potable water source .\nStock up on medical remedies .\nPrepare for supply chains of all kinds to fail and stock up accordingly .\nTransition out of fiat currency , either by spending it on things you \u2019 ll need in the future , or buying physical gold and silver .\nPrepare for energy shortages , rolling blackouts and the complete shut-down of the power grid .\nImportantly , don \u2019 t rely on high-tech solutions .\nInclude low-tech manual backups in your preps .\nIf the thought of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking action is the best remedy .\nKnowing you \u2019 re prepared will ease a lot of anxieties .\nWhy Free Speech Is on the Chopping Block Free speech is a universal concept .\nEveryone , everywhere , have a mind and want to express themselves without being censored or canceled for their views .\nFree speech is now under attack worldwide , and the truly massive attack on free speech began at the same time as the coup d \u2019 \u00e9tat started .\nThis is because silencing dissent is required for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technocrat transhumanist revolutionaries must destroy free speech at the same time that they take over the world , because they have to control the narrative , \u201d Wood explains .\n\u201c The attacks on free speech right now are absolutely legendary , off the charts , everywhere on the planet .\nIf Mattias Desmet is right , and I feel absolutely certain that he is , because I can read a history book as easy as anybody , when free speech is effectively silenced , that is when the killing of the scapegoat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scapegoat that gets killed first .\nThere may be other groups that get mixed in , but the people who are the scapegoat are the ones that will be attacked by the mass formation psychosis crowd.\n\u201d Eventually , the totalitarian regime will devour its own .\nIt \u2019 ll kill its own leaders in the name of the greater good .\nBut in the meantime , it \u2019 ll start by culling various scapegoats , one group after another .\n\u201c Original technocracy from the 1930s , was defined in their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Technocrat Magazine.\n\u2019 They defined themselves in 1938 as \u2018 the science of social engineering.\n\u2019 That was what they said about themselves .\nTechnocracy is the science of social engineering and they talked incessantly in their literature about Pavlov and BF Skinner and how they could control people and mold people to the economy , to the utopia that they wanted to build .\nThey \u2019 ve had since 1938 , at the very least , to think about how to develop the science of social engineering to be used against humanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to even think about it any further .\nWe can feel it today .\nIt \u2019 s right in our face , every day .\nThey \u2019 re using these techniques against the people of the world to manipulate them , to hypnotize them , to push them into mass formation psychosis .\nSomebody at the top knows exactly what they \u2019 re doing with this .\nThat \u2019 s my point.\n\u201d And , again , tech companies like Google and Facebook play central roles in that effort .\nI look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terminator series .\nThey \u2019 re probably the worst offender of all the technology companies that are accelerating this .\nThey the champions of social engineering .\nThey own DeepMind , the most sophisticated artificial intelligence company on the planet , and they \u2019 re clearly using it for nefarious purposes .\nThat said , they \u2019 re certainly not alone .\nIn closing , we need to give careful thought to how we might slow down , block or at least limit the devastation that \u2019 s been planned for us .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside from preparing yourself and your family with the essentials for life , is to buck the narrative .\n\u201c Anytime you feel like you \u2019 re being given a role to play , just refuse to play that role , \u201d Wood says .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t care what it is , just don \u2019 t do it .\nIf they say , \u2018 You need to wear a mask because blah , blah , blah \u2014 don \u2019 t wear a mask .\nJust don \u2019 t play the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there \u2019 s a lot of personal choice here .\nYou got to make a personal decision on what it \u2019 s worth to you to do it .\nI personally haven \u2019 t worn a mask yet .\nIt \u2019 s cost me .\nI haven \u2019 t flown an airplane for a long time .\nI didn \u2019 t go a lot of places .\nIt \u2019 s important to keep your mouth open , not shut .\nWe need to reestablish human connection again .\nThis has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lockdowns and everything else .\nGet in touch with people .\nIt hurts , I realize , for a lot of people , because relationships have been burned between children and parents and brothers and sisters .\nGet over it , deal with it .\nYou have to get out and reconnected with people again , because the future of humanity is in those connections .\nJust don \u2019 t argue with them .\nIf you love them , love them anyway , in spite of where they are .\nBut it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like-minded people and spend time developing deeper relationships with people .\nGuys have lost the ability to have best friends , almost universally across the country .\nWomen are better at having best friends , but they \u2019 ve been denied best friends because everything \u2019 s been broken up .\nGet embedded in a local church and start going to these home fellowships , whatever , where people are meeting face to face and just talk to them \u2026 We have a lot of answers and a lot of tangible things we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it , be prepared to do it .\nWhen you have the opportunity , open your mouth and help them out .\nAt least , give them some hope , because right now the other side wants you to have no hope .\nThey want to strip all hope away from you so that you will turn to the government or turn to the technocrats for help .\nWe need to help people with this whole hope business and not to sell hopium , as some people call it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they can do right now to put up a defense around their own body , around their own mind or whatever it might be \u2026 This is where we are as a world today \u2014 we , on the non-mass formation psychosis side , we \u2019 re all in .\nWhether anybody else recognizes that as immaterial , but we are all in this .\nThis is the most important civilizational , existential thing that we \u2019 ll ever deal with in our lifetime .\nIt really is that important .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , \u2018 Well , it \u2019 s just another problem , \u2019 kind of like , \u2018 We had problems with Jimmy Carter.\n\u2019 No , it \u2019 s not that kind of problem .\nThis is a bigger existential threat that we \u2019 re facing right now .\nWe must be dead serious .\nBut there \u2019 s hope , I will say .\nAnd until it \u2019 s over , it \u2019 s not over .\nWe can make a difference and we need to try .\nWe just can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say there \u2019 s no point trying , I \u2019 m going to go home and get drunk .\nKlaus Schwab told you , with his own lips , that by 2030 you will own nothing and you will be happy .\nThey \u2019 re trying to make it happen .\nYes , they are .\nOne of the reasons , by the way , that the World Economic Forum has met with the United Nations to speed up the agenda , closer on this side of 2030 , is because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agenda .\nI \u2019 m convinced of this .\nI \u2019 ve been watching this since the beginning .\nAmericans can \u2019 t have 500,000 people in the street protesting anything , that doesn \u2019 t happen here .\nThat \u2019 s just not our culture .\nBut not Europe , at the drop of a hat , you \u2019 ll get a 100,000 people in the street , all screaming and banging pots and pans and hollering and carrying signs .\nI know they see these massive hordes of people that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no \u2019 \u2026 This has to have an impact on them .\nI think that \u2019 s one reason they \u2019 re trying to accelerate the program right now and make it happen faster .\nTo me , that \u2019 s just kind of a little bit of a sign of resistance is working , and this to me , this ought to tell the resistance to double down \u2014 double down right now on whatever it is you \u2019 re doing .\nDo twice as much as you did last week or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure on it .\n\u201d", "author": "HAF", "url":

societal control , decided to take advantage of the pandemic in order to increase their authoritarian power .\nProminent among them was , Klaus Schwab , founder and executive chairman of World Economic Forum ( WEF ) .\nIn June 2020 , he stated that \u201c the pandemic represents a rare but narrow window of opportunity to reflect , reimagine , and reset our world.\n\u201d According to him , \u201c every country , from the United States to China , must participate , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tech , must be transformed.\n\u201d It is no secret that the WEF has focused on accelerating the implementation of central planning for the entire global population since the early days of pandemic .\nThis plan to establish a new world order , known as the Great Reset , was a key theme at the recent annual meeting of the WEF , which was held during May 22\u201326 in Davos , Switzerland .\nDrastic changes to the world order like the Great Reset do not happen spontaneously ; rather , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influential billionaires , politicians , celebrities , biased academics , wealthy philanthropists , and the bureaucrats of international organizations and institutions .\nThese types of people support social engineering , because it will enable them to acquire control over the world \u2019 s wealth and natural resources , and strengthen their ability to shape society as they see fit .\nLike their predecessors across history , the social engineers of the WEF believe that \u201c there must be no spontaneous , unguided activity , because it might produce results which can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not provide .\nIt might produce something new , undreamt of in the philosophy of the planner.\n\u201d 1 Based on the WEF agenda , the successful completion of the current industrial transformation will require redesigning and controlling every minuscule aspect of human life and behavior , including the private spheres of individuals , the economy , politics , and societal organizations , without the possibility of voluntary and spontaneous cooperation between individuals based on their will , values , thoughts , and beliefs .\nWe were warned almost two centuries ago that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it will be \u201c busy with a multitude of small \u201d tasks penetrating \u201c into private life , \u201d governing families , and dictating the \u201c actions \u201d and \u201c tastes of individuals.\n\u201d 2 In fact , some of the most ridiculous controls proposed by the WEF included limiting the washing of jeans to no \u201c more than once a month \u201d and \u201c pyjamas once a week.\n\u201d The WEF also advocates for transforming entire food systems by encouraging people to consume insects , arguing that \u201c insect protein has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alternative source of protein throughout the food chain , from feed for aquaculture to ingredients for nutritional supplements for humans and pets.\n\u201d Reforming the food system would also involve eating \u201c cultured meat , \u201d referring to \u201c meat product created by cultivating animal cells in a controlled lab environment.\n\u201d The WEF also supports the elimination of \u201c car ownership , \u201d as \u201c paying for a ride or delivery is as easy as tapping a smart phone app , \u201d and \u201c renting a vehicle \u201d means that \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappear.\n\u201d Ultimately , the Great Reset aims to create a world where \u201c you will own nothing , and will be happy \u201d by 2030 , as people will not possess any private property and rent everything they \u201c need in life.\n\u201d However , this premise ignores the fact that private property ownership is associated with the advancement of civilizations , higher stages of material and moral development , and the development of modern family life .\nThe WEF scenario would also diminish the sense of security , which is strengthened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once the Great Reset is complete , individuals will essentially have their thinking and decision-making \u201c done for them by men much like themselves , addressing them or speaking in their name.\n\u201d 3 Such a \u201c desire to force upon the people a creed which is regarded as salutary for them is \u2026 not a thing that is new or peculiar to our time.\n\u201d 4 However , as various totalitarian regimes throughout history have demonstrated , the oppressive central planning of social engineers leads to the masses \u2019 losing their sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creativity , and strength .\nAlso lost is the incentive to improve one \u2019 s own condition and contribute to the progress of society.5 If the social engineering of the WEF is successful , then , by 2030 , one will not be able to rely on oneself , family members , relatives , friends , or the community .\nThis is because the supporters any absolutist regime want traditions and customs to be corrupted , \u201c memories obliterated , habits destroyed , \u2026 liberty , chased from the laws.\n\u201d 6 In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a societal order where sympathy and mutual assistance will be rendered obsolete and where every citizen of the world is equally powerless , poor , and isolated , so that people will be unable to oppose the organized strength of global governance and become dependent on governments and their allies for their survival .\nEventually , nothing will protect citizens any longer , and citizens will no longer protect themselves .\nSocial engineers of the WEF are essentially advocating for natural freedom , which would allow the strong to exercise their power while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are basically calling for the world to move backward in the development of human history toward the reinstitution of feudalism and slavery .\nIt is important to remember that economic freedom , positive freedom , political freedom , freedom of thought , freedom of speech , and freedom of the press are not attributes of primitive man or serfdom ; rather , they are products of the most advanced stages of society .\nTo be more precise , these types of freedom are outcomes of the efforts of countless thinkers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout human history .\nHowever , social engineers are not interested in the history and struggles of our civilization , as they believe that they possess expertise in all areas , which is the line of thought at the heart of all dictatorial regimes.7 They do not think that social engineering is alien to the true nature of human beings , even though it is based on \u201c mechanical exactness \u201d and does not \u201c spring from a man \u2019 s free choice.\n\u201d 8 Furthermore , advocates of social engineering ignore the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in powers of mind and heart , in well-being and in technique , in law and morality , necessarily involves the participation of the lower classes.\n\u201d 9 Anyone who believes that the social engineers of the WEF have noble intentions at heart as they design and implement the Great Reset should heed the warning of President Franklin D. Roosevelt ( 1935 ) , who ( ironically ) declared : The doctrine of regulation and legislation by \u201c master minds \u201d in whose judgment and will all the people may gladly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent at Washington during these last 10 years .\nWere it possible to find \u201c master minds \u201d so unselfish , so willing to decide unhesitatingly against their own personal interests or private prejudices , men almost godlike in their ability hold the scales of justice with an even hand , such a government might be to the interests of the country ; but there are no such on our political horizon , and we can not expect a complete reversal of all the teachings of history .\n1 .\nF.A .\nHayek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; repr.\n, New York : Routledge , 2006 ) , p. 166 .\n2 .\nAlexis de Tocqueville , Democracy in America : Historical-Critical Edition of \u201c De la d\u00e9mocratie en Am\u00e9rique , \u201d ed .\nEduardo Nolla and trans .\nJames T.

non-governmental organizations , and media personalities met in Davos , Switzerland to plot the future of the world .\nAs the Davos crowd returns to Switzerland for the first in person World Economic Forum meeting in more than 2 years , several topics were at the forefront of discussion .\nFrom energy to inflation , Ukraine and globalization , the Metaverse and ESG criteria , the annual meeting of wannabe elitists saw discussions on a wide range of pressing topics .\nThis article is a brief look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year \u2019 s meeting .\n( Due to the fact that there are literally hundreds of talks and panels to review from this last week , there may be additional forthcoming investigations based on the WEF 2022 . )\nWhile most of the diplomats and heads of state commenting on the Ukraine-Russia conflict committed to supporting the Ukrainian government , former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger started off the week by encouraging the international community to cede some territory to Russia so there may be peace .\n\u201c Ideally , the dividing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status quo ante .\nPursuing the war beyond that point would not be about the freedom of Ukraine but a new war against Russia itself , \u201d Kissinger said .\nKissinger \u2019 s statements indicate a support for allowing Russia to maintain control of Crimea and informally rule the Donbass region .\nHowever , on Wednesday Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy criticized Kissingerfor his statements .\n\u201c It seems that Mr. Kissinger \u2019 s calendar is not 2022 , but 1938 , and he thought he was talking to an audience not in Davos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d Zelenskyy said .\n\u201c By the way , in the real year 1938 , when Mr. Kissinger \u2019 s family was fleeing Nazi Germany , he was 15 years old , and he understood everything perfectly .\nAnd nobody heard from him then that it was necessary to adapt to the Nazis instead of fleeing them or fighting them.\n\u201d Meanwhile , Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said peace negotiations with Russia are going \u201c nowhere \u201d .\nThe coming days and weeks will reveal whether the globalist jet set crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentor Henry Kissinger , or western puppet Zelenskyy .\nYouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki further cemented her company \u2019 s commitment to censoring information that does not align with the official narratives shilled by corporate media .\nWojcicki made the comments to Alyson Shontell Lombardi , the Editor-in-Chief of Fortune Magazine , when asked whether YouTube \u2019 s efforts to censor misinformation will always be a \u201c work in progress.\n\u201d \u201c I think there \u2019 ll always be work that we have to do because there will always be incentives for people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c The challenge will be to keep staying ahead of that and make sure that we are understanding what they are and the different ways that people may use to try to trick our systems and make sure that our systems are staying ahead of what \u2019 s necessary to make sure that we are managing that.\n\u201d As Reclaim The Net reports , YouTube has already deleted more than a million videos for \u201c COVID misinformation , \u201d plans to preemptively censor \u201c new misinformation , \u201d and has considered hiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThere were , of course , discussions on the way the Metaverse is shaping the future .\nPerhaps the biggest announcement involves the WEF \u2019 s new initiative \u201c Defining and Building the Metaverse \u201d .\nThe WEF says the initiative will \u201c bring together key stakeholders to build an economically viable , interoperable , safe and inclusive metaverse \u201d .\nThe announcement was welcomed by Stephanie Burns of Sony Interactive Entertainment , Brad Smith , President and Vice-Chair of Microsoft , Nick Clegg , former deputy prime minister of the U.K. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( formerly Facebook ) , and Peggy Johnson of Magic Leap Inc , formerly the CEO of Microsoft and involved in the ID2020 project .\nPeggy Johnson also participated in a panel titled \u201c Shaping a Shared Future : Making the Metaverse \u201d .\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella also participated in a panel with WEF Founder Klaus Schwab discussing the Metaverse and the future of work .\nI encourage you to read my two part investigation ( part 1 and 2 ) into the Great Narrative and Metaverse to better understand the implications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having passed since the World Health Organizations announcement of a \u201c global pandemic \u201d , the topic of vaccinations was high on the list of priorities , especially as corporate media begins to sound the alarm on \u201c a new wave of COVID-19 infections \u201d and concerns about Monkeypox ( TLAV will be investigating the Monkeypox situation as it develops ) .\nPharmaceutical giant Pfizer committed to providing all of their current and future patent-protected medicines on a not-for-profit basis to 45 low-income nations .\nThe move was announced by Pfizer CEO Alberta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adverse reactions caused by Pfizer \u2019 s COVID-19 injections .\nAnother panel titled \u201c Preparing for the Next Pandemic \u201d , featured Billy Boy ; Peter Sands , Executive Director , The Global Fund To Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis & Malaria ; Helen E. Clark of the WHO ; and Francis deSouza , President and Chief Executive Officer , Illumina Inc .\nThe presence of deSouza and Illumina is an interesting choice , especially in regards to the \u201c next pandemic \u201d , because the company deals with DNA sequencing and genomics .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c The Post-Pandemic City : Not Business as Usual \u201d , featuring speakers imagining how a city might change in the post-COVID-19 world .\nInterestingly , participating in the panel is Francis Suarez , Mayor of Miami and President of the United States Conference of Mayors .\nThis detail is worth noting as an example of how a global agenda \u2014 Agenda 2030 , climate change , sustainable design \u2014 starts at places like the WEF and filters its way down to the local level where it is implemented by local officials like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change was a hot topic throughout the week .\nThere were strong words from Xie Zhenhua , China \u2019 s Special Envoy for Climate Change , saying words were not enough .\n\u201c It isn \u2019 t just about words anymore \u2013 it is about action .\nClimate action , now , is critical.\n\u201d Also , US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry said the only way forward was to \u201c radically change our economic system and our reliance on fossil fuels \u201d over the next 8 years .\nKerry also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change , we need the political will .\nIf we can harness this , we can still avoid the worst effects of climate change.\n\u201d When it comes to specific actions taken by the globalists \u201c in the name of fighting climate change \u201d , a new public-private partnership was announced focused on carbon capture programs .\nThe so-called First Movers Coalition is focused on cleaning up the most carbon-intensive industry sectors .\nDuring the WEF meeting the coalition announced a major expansion to more than 50 corporate members worth about $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading governments .\nJohn Kerry made the announcement alongside Billy Boy , founder of Breakthrough Energy .\nThe coalition welcomed new nations India , Japan , and Sweden to the Steering Board , as well as Denmark , Italy , Norway , Singapore , and the United Kingdom as government partners .\nCorporations signing on for the First Movers Coalition include Alphabet , Microsoft , AES , Aveva , Ball Corporation , BHP , Consolidated Contractors Company , Ecolab , Enel , EY , FedEx , Ford Motor Company , HeidelbergCement , Mitsui @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Novelis , PWC , Schneider Electric , Swiss Re , and Vestas .\nOne of the methods that companies are using to measure the success of these types of programs is to base them on environmental , social , and governance ( ESG ) criteria .\nESG investing is also sometimes referred to as sustainable investing , responsible investing , or socially responsible investing ( SRI ) .\nThe practice has become an increasingly popular way to promote the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and was on full display at WEF 22 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ focused on corporations attempting to \u201c go green \u201d , many researchers suspect ESG-like criteria will eventually be applied to individuals as some form of social credit score .\nFor example , during a panel titled \u201c Responsible Consumption \u201d , Alibaba Group president , J. Michael Evans , discussed the importance of his company and others adopting the ESG criteria .\nHe also boasted about the development of an \u201c individual carbon footprint tracker \u201d to monitor what you buy , what you eat , as well as where and how you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company is working on incentivizing the public to use systems which encourage environmentally friendly behavior .\nThe system described by Evans is part of the push towards consumer incentivization using points and rewards .\nThese systems are another step in the direction of social credit scores .\n\u201c We have something within our business called A Map .\nSo what we are going to do is allow people to calculate the best route , the most efficient route , and also the most efficient form of transportation .\nThen , if they take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them bonus points that they can redeem elsewhere on our platform .\nSo they are incentivized to do the right thing.\n\u201d One of the most impactful topics being discussed was Central Bank Digital Currencies ( CBDCs ) .\nA panel on CBDCs featured Kristalina Georgieva , Managing Director , International Monetary Fund ; Sethaput Suthiwartnarueput , Governor , Bank of Thailand ; Fran\u00e7ois Villeroy de Galhau , Governor , Central Bank of France ; and Axel Lehmann , Chairman of the Board of Directors , Credit Suisse AG .\nWhen making the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Banks , Georgieva took some shots at cryptocurrencies .\n\u201c Bitcoin may be called a coin , but it \u2019 s not money .\nIt \u2019 s not a stable store of value , \u201d she stated .\nFran\u00e7ois Villeroy de Galhau , a governor with the Central Bank of France , called cryptocurrencies \u201c not a reliable means of payment \u201d .\nThe reason for this animosity towards private cryptocurrency use is that it is a thorn in the side of the globalists who seek to end the use of cash and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not track and trace .\nThe fact that CBDCs were discussed in several panels with high level authorities in their respective fields is an indication that CBDCs will continue to be an important part of the WEF \u2019 s Great Reset agenda .", "author": "HAF", "url": "https://humansbefree.com/2022/07/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-world-economic-forums-2022-meeting.html", "published": "Fri, 01 Jul 2022 17:55:46 +0000", "published_utc": 1656712546, "collection_utc": 1656714926}, {"id": "humansarefree--2022-07-01--The Great Reset Aims to End Freedom of the Press, Speech, and Expression", "date": "2022-07-01", "source": "humansarefree", "title": "The Great Reset Aims to End Freedom of the Press, Speech, and Expression", "content": "Governments , corporations , and elites have always been fearful of the power of a free press , because it is capable of exposing their lies , destroying their carefully crafted images , and undermining their authority .\nIn recent years , alternative journalism has been growing and more people are relying on social media platforms as sources of news and information .\nIn response , the corporate state , digital conglomerates , and the mainstream media have been increasingly supportive of the silencing and censoring of alternative media outlets and voices that challenge the official narrative on most issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting in Davos , Switzerland , \u201c Australian eSafety commissioner \u201d Julie Inman Grant stated that \u201c freedom of speech is not the same thing as a free for all , \u201d and that \u201c we are going to need a recalibration of a whole range of human rights that are playing out online\u2014from freedom of speech \u2026 to be free from online violence.\n\u201d Meanwhile , the Canadian government is seeking to restrict independent media and the freedom of expression via the implementation of Bill C-11 , which would allow it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internet , including content on Spotify , Tik Tok , YouTube , and podcast clients .\nSimilarly , the UK is seeking to introduce an Online Safety Bill , the US \u201c paused \u201d the establishment of a Disinformation Governance Board following backlash , and the European Union approved its own Digital Services Act , all of which aim to limit the freedom of speech .\nAttempts by elites and politicians to silence dissenters and critical thinkers is not something new .\nIn fact , history is full of examples of \u201c the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning of scientific books , and the systematic eradication of the intelligentsia of the subjected people.\n\u201d 1 However , these current efforts to curtail freedom of speech and press by supposedly liberal governments are still somewhat ironic , given that even \u201c the most intolerant of churches , the Roman Catholic Church , even at the canonization of a saint , admits , and listens patiently to , a \u2018 devil \u2019 s advocate.\n\u2019 The holiest of men , it appears , can not be admitted to posthumous honors , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him is known and weighed.\n\u201d 2 The corporate state , digital conglomerates , and the mainstream media want to ensure that they have the exclusive authority to dictate people \u2019 s opinions , wants , and choices through their sophisticated propaganda techniques .\nTo do so , they have even resorted to transforming falsehoods into truth .\nIn fact , the word truth has already had its original meaning altered , as those who speak the truth on certain subjects are now regularly accused of spreading hate speech , misinformation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c longer something to be found , with the individual conscience as the sole arbiter of whether in any particular instance the evidence ( or the standing of those proclaiming it ) warrants a belief ;

"content": "On Tuesday , as TFTP predicted , Ghislaine Maxwell was handed down a sentence that was 30 years less than prosecutors were asking .\nThanks to U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan \u2014 who has been granting Maxwell special treatment throughout her prosecution \u2014 Maxwell could be out of prison in less than a decade with good behavior .\nAs we reported back in March of 2021 , Maxwell \u2019 s privilege began to show through as her requests to redact evidence were allowed .\nJudge Nathan issued a ruling on redactions that Maxwell had asked for regarding transcripts the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to the judge , the evidence was too \u201c sensational and impure \u201d to reveal to the public .\n\u201c Those portions of the transcript , which were redacted in the civil

granting Maxwell her request , in November , judge Nathan was nominated by President Joe Biden to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was given despite the horrific testimonies by Maxwell \u2019 s victims .\nVictims of Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein ; Annie Farmer , Virginia Giuffre , Elizabeth Stein , Sarah Ransome , Teresa Helm and \u201c Kate , \u201d who has used the pseudonym to identify herself , all filed victim impact statements and asked Nathan to consider their suffering when sentencing Maxwell .\nAlthough Nathan claimed to consider them , she still handed down a sentence that was less than adequate .\nAccording to reports , Ransome said that the half of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex toy \u201d by Maxwell and Epstein spurred her to attempt suicide twice .\nGraphic photos of her taken inside a hospital room after those attempts were included in the filing .\n\u201c Judge Nathan , I hope when you consider the appropriate prison sentence for the role Maxwell played in this sex trafficking operation , you take into account the ongoing suffering of the many women she abused and exploited as we will continue to live with the memories of the ways she

part in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the victims have since called on the FBI to continue their investigation into the other abusers Maxwell and Epstein provided with sex trafficked children .\nThey

anti-Christ .\nIts methods employ every weapon and technique available including sophisticated forms of propaganda and psyops .\nIts objective is to crush the human spirit and make it bend the knee to a superclass of elitist , authoritarian overlords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of us .\nThe perpetrators have every intention of subjugating the masses to their rule , while trying to convince us it \u2019

life would not return to normal , they really did mean it .\nEverything they touch has been turned upside down and rendered completely opposite of nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeks to completely overturn societal norms , laws , customs , and traditions .\nIt revels in substituting evil for good and darkness for light .\nThe wizards behind the curtain are creating chaos and disorder on an unprecedented scale with the goal of rebuilding a new , global , and totalitarian society from the rubble of destruction .\nThey have mastered war techniques from ancient Chinese general Sun Tzu \u2019 s Art of War , which includes sowing division , promoting deception , and attacking while the enemy is weak and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their most prized tactics , but there are many others .\nThey Want Control of Everything Not satisfied with controlling most of the wealth , they seek to own and control everything including all-genetic material , natural resources , the food supply , and even human DNA .\nStating the obvious , the War of Inversion goes by other names such as the Great Reset , where the chief warmongers claim you will own nothing and be happy .\nIts proponents masquerade as

government ; corporate board rooms ; military strategy sessions ; secret meetings ; elementary , secondary , and higher education classrooms ; and over the airwaves via propaganda vomited from the

children \u2019 s lives are permanently damaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies , and technology .\nThey promote a disordered view of reality that declares men can have menstrual cycles , become pregnant , and birth children while they pump harmful drugs and perform dangerous , often irreversible surgeries on minors so they can become transgender .\nThey tell women it \u2019 s okay to lop off their breasts , remove their vaginas , take testosterone , and surgically create fake penises .\nMeanwhile , pedophiles are seeking to gain public acceptance as they rebrand themselves as Minor Attracted Persons ( MAPs ) instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are .\nBiden \u2019 s USDA has recently announced that transgender-identifying students must be allowed to enter the bathrooms of their choosing or they will be deprived

fifty years from now ?\nThese smug , self-appointed rulers represent all that is evil and vile while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are nothing but wolves in sheep \u2019 s clothing and dark clouds without rain .\nMany of them have aligned themselves with the occult and practiced the satanic \u201c do as thou will shall be the whole of the law \u201d doctrine .\nPopularized by Aleister Crowley \u2019 s Telema , Anton LaVey \u2019 s Church of Satan , and Michael Aquino \u2019 s Temple of Set , satanic teaching achieved widespread influence in Hollywood , the music industry , education , the military , and many other sectors .\nThough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system allows practitioners to justify anything they do no matter how repugnant , harmful , and horrifying it may truly be .\nThis is why you are seeing celebrities such as Megan Fox admit to drinking human blood .\nThough they may pretend otherwise , at the core , all of them are narcissists , many are sociopaths , and an increasing number have become psychopaths .\nHowever , they \u2019 re usually not the ones committing atrocities like mass shootings and bombing innocent civilians \u201c mistaken \u201d for terrorists .\nThey operate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating the policies and giving the orders for other foot soldiers to carry out these sadistic acts of violence .\nThey see themselves as men and women of renown , a special , gifted class destined to rule the world and everything in it .\nSome of them even believe they will colonize Mars , upload their consciences to the cloud , and achieve immortality .\nFull of extreme pride and conceit , these tyrants see you and me as nothing more than \u201c hackable animals \u201d here to serve their every need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to progress at the rate they desire , they won \u2019 t even need much of our service in the near future .\nTheir ultimate plan is to supplant us with robots , artificial intelligence , and Internet of Things ( IoT ) smart technology .\nIf all goes according to plan , these technological breakthroughs will make much of humanity expendable , so they \u2019 ve employed all kinds of methods to kill us including DNA altering and experimental gene therapies known as COVID-19 jjabs .\nThey \u2019 ve tried to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that narrative has been exposed so now they are shifting to new threats like Monkeypox , bird flu , and bioterror attacks .\nI believe this pivot is largely to steer people away from the fact that the COVID-19 bioweapon jabs have caused a massive die-off of the human population .\nAs population control is one of the central tenets of the globalist overlords , those duped into taking the jabs have helped them reduce the population to a much more manageable level .\nAfter all , there is a monument in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaring the population must be maintained under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature .\nFor those who aren \u2019 t killed off by big pharma , war , toxic chemicals , starvation or other means , the plan is to plunge us into poverty and government dependence .\nCreepy Joe Biden and the Federal Reserve are doing their best to oversee the controlled demolition of the economy under the guise of the \u201c Putin price hike \u201d and transition to the so-called green economy .\nAs a result , gas prices have soared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town and inflation is rising so fast that it \u2019 s quickly emptying everyone \u2019 s wallets .\nVery rapidly , the paradigms of life experienced over the last half century plus are shifting from : \u2022 Governance through public institutions

restricted movement through biometric digital IDs , IoT , artificial intelligence , and social credit monitoring \u2022 A world populated with over 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1-2 billion people \u2022 Individual ownership leading to wealth and upward mobility to owning nothing and surviving on the pittance of Universal Basic Income \u2022 Freedom of religion to worship of the state \u2022 Robust natural food production and consumption to tightly controlled food production allowing only GMOs , lab grown meat , insects , seaweed , and algae for consumption \u2022 Unlimited enjoyment and exploration of the natural world to restrictions on travel and movement relying on digital experiences like the metaverse and a digital twin of the earth \u2022 Limited human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationships through social media , metaverse , etc .\n\u2022 Rule of law to rule by the decrees of technocratic tyrants This is indeed a lot to digest , and for many it is so unpalatable they simply bury their head in the sand and continue blindly through life , hoping this will all just go away .\nBut this War of Inversion will not cease unless there is continued resistance at every turn .\nThey desire to achieve most of their objectives by 2030 , right in line with the United Nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason there was such an acceleration of change beginning with the plandemic in 2020 .\nThe fork-tongued snakes at the top of the global pyramid want you dependent on them for everything .\nThis is why they want control of everything under the guise of saving the planet from climate change , ever-mutating viruses and plagues , and devastating cyber-attacks that threaten critical infrastructure and expose all of your private data .\nThey trot out crisis after crisis to keep you traumatized and focused on anything but their continued plans of domination .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineered chaos at its best .\nTheir Rule is Not a Foregone Conclusion They love to pretend they are a united front , but they often disagree on how to implement their schemes .\nThis should encourage us to continue to defy them , as a house divided can not stand .\nThrough predictive programming and publicly stating their goals , they want to make us think that their rule is inevitable , and that resistance is futile .\nHowever , there are victories occurring every day by ordinary people taking on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad but true that much of their power has been achieved by our own dereliction of duty .\nAs abolitionist Wendel Phillips stated in 1852 , \u201c Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.\n\u201d In many ways we have failed to protect our children , communities , wealth , health , and peace of mind by giving government bureaucrats and anointed experts too much control , all for the sake of ease and convenience .\nBut it \u2019 s time to get back in the trenches and fight this enemy by speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , forming our own support systems , and continuing to live our lives without fear and panic .\nWe all have a part to play in wresting control from those who seek to do us harm .\nWhether it is through writing , speaking , creating , organizing , planning , inventing , or teaching , all of us have been gifted in some area to contribute to defeating this beast seeking to devour us .\nNow is the time to use whatever talents and gifts you have to advance the cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light in the midst of all this darkness .\nIf your message is not received by some , keep it moving and don \u2019 t waste time and energy arguing with fools .\nPay attention to what \u2019 s happening , but don \u2019 t let it consume you .\nFind time to do things you enjoy despite the dire conditions .\nConnect with God and people who have your best interest in mind .\nRemember , nothing is impossible to them that believe !\nThis war can be won by those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and willing to make sacrifices to see that the enemies of God , humanity , and nature are all exposed and brought to justice .",

investigation into \u201c ritualized child sexual abuse \u201d , we take a deep dive into the history of the allegations which involve The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints .\nAn investigation into ritualized child sexual abuse was first announced by the Utah County Sheriff \u2019 s Office on May 31st .\nThe USCO released a statement detailing how \u201c multiple county and federal agencies are investigating reports of ritualistic child sexual abuse from as far back as 1990 \u201d .\nI have been following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporting on various angles of the story .\nI encourage readers to spend time with the previous four parts of this series , particularly the third report on the history of similar allegations in the state of Utah .\nFor this report I will be looking at the historical record , including lawsuits , church records , and previous reporting from other outlets to document the history of allegations involving members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , otherwise known as the Mormon Church .\nI have spoken with current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold varying views regarding allegations of ritualized child sexual abuse .\nSome former members of the Church of Mormon believe the church itself is corrupted at its root which allows for these types of activities to happen in the first place .\nI have also spoken with members of the Church of Mormon who acknowledge that the church has a pedophile problem , but do not believe the core structures of the church are infected by pedophiles .\nI want to make it clear that this investigation is not intended to be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or individual Mormons .\nNor is this piece intended to paint the picture that the entire Church of Mormon is aware of the reports of child sexual abuse .\nAlthough some former members of the church have gone so far as accusing the Church of Mormon of being a front for Masonic and/or Satanic activity , I am not ready to make such a judgement .\nHowever , I do believe these controversial claims warrant further investigation .\nFor part 5 of our series we will be examining 4 different examples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mormon over the last 40 plus years .\nIn 1990 , Glenn L. Pace , a general authority in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , wrote a memo to church leadership describing claims of widespread ritualistic abuse within the church .\nThe memo , dated July 19 , 1990 , was based on the complaints of sixty members of the church who claimed they were forced to participate in various rituals , sometimes referred to as \u201c satanic.\n\u201d \u201c I have met with sixty victims .\nThat number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many if I did not discipline myself to only one meeting per week , \u201d Pace wrote .\n\u201c I have not wanted my involvement with this issue to become a handicap in fulfilling my assigned responsibilities .\nOn the other hand , I felt someone needed to pay the price to obtain an intellectual and spiritual conviction as to the seriousness of this problem within the Church.\n\u201d Pace sent the memo to LDS President Ezra Taft Benson detailing a year of interviews with alleged ritual abuse survivors in Utah , Idaho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pace memo describes incidents of ritualized abuse , and even claims of human sacrifice .\nPace would state that he was convinced at least 800 members of the church were involved or had knowledge of the abuse , including bishops , a diocese president , patriarchs , temple workers , members of the church \u2019 s Young Women and Young Men groups , and members of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir .\nPace said he believed the purpose of the torture of children was to cause disassociation .\nHe said as a result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new personality to enable them to endure various forms of abuse \u201d .\n\u201c The basic objective is premeditated \u2014 to systematically and methodically torture and terrorize children until they are forced to dissociate , \u201d Pace wrote .\n\u201c The torture is not a consequence of the loss of temper , but the execution of well-planned , well-thought out rituals often performed by close relatives .\nThe only escape for the children is to dissociate.\n\u201d Once the Pace Memo leaked to the public , the Church of Mormon was quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u2018 \u2018 It seems to me that even though one actual case is tragic and is one too many , the reports of ritualistic killings are likely overblown , whether they be in connection with members of our church , of other churches or any other segment of society , none of which is immune , \u201d Church spokesman Don LeFevre told the Chicago Tribune at the time of the leak .\nSgt .\nDon Bell , chief of the Salt Lake City police department \u2019 s intelligence unit at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tribune that his office receives about six reports a year alleging satanic abuse .\n\u201c I have no doubt whatsoever that these people who describe enduring satanic ritual abuse are victims of some very profound type of abuse , \u201d Bell said .\n\u201c But I do not believe that there is an inter-generational network of Satanists active in this valley.\n\u201d Pace himself told the media he was skeptical of the allegations until he spent a year interviewing survivors of the rituals , many who suffered from disassociated identity disorder and various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuse .\nAs a result of the Pace Memo , the church \u2019 s ruling three-man First Presidency , led by Ezra Taft Benson at the time , sent a letter to local church leaders warning about Satanism .\nThe letter warned church members against affiliating with \u201c the occult or those mysterious powers it espouses \u201d .\nThe Pace Memo going mainstream was one of the reasons the Utah Attorney General \u2019 s office launched their own investigation into ritual abuse in 1992 .\nAs detailed in part 3 of this series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office hired Mike King and Mark Jacobson to further investigate the claims of ritualistic sexual abuse .\nThe final report for the AG \u2019 s office found that \u201c evidence has been uncovered to support the thought that individuals have in the past , and are now committing

of government and religion were unsubstantiated \u201d .\nRegarding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mormon , Mike King told the Salt Lake Tribune they were \u201c absurd \u201d .\nThirty years after the Pace Memo was released to the public , it has largely been forgotten by those outside of the Church of Mormon .\nDespite the claims of absurdity by Mike King , Glen Pace remained committed to telling the stories of the alleged victims .\nIn the conclusion to his memo , he writes : \u201c I also believe that the scriptures cited and many others that could be quoted argue against our being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t want to be known as an alarmist or a fanatic on the issue .\nNow that I have put what I have learned in writing to you , I feel the issue is in the right court .\n\u201c I hope to take a low profile on the subject and get on with the duties which I have been formally assigned .\nThis is not to say I would not be willing to be of service .\nOver the last eighteen months I have acquired a compassionate love and respect for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety of their physical lives and , more importantly , their souls.\n\u201d In 1993 , a book was published purporting to be the stories of two different women in the Church of Mormon who has suffered sexual abuse within the community .\nThe book , Paperdolls : Healing from Sexual Abuse in Mormon Neighborhoods , is written by the pseudonymous authors April Daniels and Carol Scott .\nPublisher \u2019 s Weekly described the book as a \u201c moving and often frustrating \u201d document that alternates between the experiences of Daniels and Scott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her early 30s , begins to recall the abuse she suffered , beginning when she was five , at the hands of various relatives and neighbors , \u201d the review states .\n\u201c Scott , the mother of a friend of hers and a psychology professor , records her discovery that many of the same people recently have been abusing her grandchildren .\nBoth women are Mormons , and most of the nearly 20 abusers appear to be church members.\n\u201d April claims her parents were \u201c secret alcoholics \u201d who took pornographic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s Polaroid camera .\nShe says when she was seven years old she was \u201c orally raped \u201d by her father to the point that her front teeth were loose for six months .\nApril says her mother had a nervous breakdown and never noticed or commented on the smell of urine on her clothes , the blood and semen on her underwear , or the hours she cried at night .\nWhile Carol and April do not describe the abuse as \u201c Satanic \u201d , Carol did believe that \u201c touching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them .\nShe outlined how first the children would be shown pornographic movies of other children before being made to undress and masturbate each other .\nThis would be followed by oral and anal sex with everyone present .\nAfter the publication of Paperdolls there were apparently internal discussions among the church leadershipregarding the true identities of the women and their alleged abusers .\nHowever , if the stories are indeed accurate , it does not appear anyone was ever held accountable .\nIn 2005 , Martha Beck , daughter of Mormon scholar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leaving the Saints : how I lost the Mormons and found my faith .\nBeck \u2019 s book was controversial for accusations that she was sexually abused by her father , and for her claim of recovered memories of the abuse .\nBeck says that church leadership were aware of her father \u2019 s crimes and chose to do nothing .\nFurther , she accuses the church leadership of aiding his crimes , by failing to act .\n\u201c I speculated about how widely gossip about my accusations had already spread through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skilled at sweeping allegations of sexual abuse under various homespun carpets , \u201d Beck writes .\n\u201c I imagined that certain people now looked at me strangely , spoke to me in guarded , hesitant tones .\nI suspected that even though the Mormon powers that be might not actually threaten my life , they would probably try to ruin it .\nYes , these suspicions were outlandish .\nYes , they were paranoid .\nAnd yes , they were completely accurate.\n\u201d On page 261 of her book , she laments the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done to establish whether child sexual abuse is more common in Mormon country than in the rest of the United States .\n\u201c Personally , I think the answer is yes , particularly in the core population of Mormons who are descended from polygamous ancestors , \u201d she writes .\n\u201c Since moving away from Utah and working as a life coach for hundreds of people from all walks of life , I have encountered only a handful who say they were sexually abused as children .\nIn Provo , at the Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I couldn \u2019 t open my car door without smacking an incest survivor.\n\u201d In the chronology of the sexual abuse in the larger Mormon community , the case of Warren Jeffs looms large .\nJeffs is a convicted pedophile and former president of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints ( FLDS Church ) , a denomination of the Church of Mormon which still practices polygamy .\nWarren Jeffs \u2019 father , Rulon Jeffs , became the president of the FLDS Church in 1986 .\nThis eventually paved the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church and begin amassing his own cult following which he ruled with an iron fist .\nEventually , the accusations against Warren would enlighten the outside world to what exactly was taking place at Jeffs \u2019 Yearning for Zion Ranch in Eldorado , Texas .\nWhile we don \u2019 t have the space here to do a full exposition of Warren Jeffs and his rise and fall within the FLDS Church , it is worth noting a few points about his disturbing saga .\nFirst , the case against Jeff \u2019 s includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeffs \u2019 own nephew , Brent Jeffs .\nIn July 2004 , Brent Jeffs filed a lawsuit that Warren Jeffs had anally raped him at the FLDS Church \u2019 s Salt Lake Valley compound in the late 1980s .\nBrent Jeffs wrote a memoir titled Lost Boy describing various incidents of child sexual abuse at the hands of Warren Jeffs , his brothers , and other family members .\nThe sexual abuse happened when Brent Jeffs was 5 or 6 years old .\nBrent \u2019 s brother Clayne also made accusations against Warren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warren Jeffs own children also accused him of sexually abusing them .\nThe accusations make it clear that the case against Jeffs was not only about polygamy , as some have claimed , but about a serial pedophile who was enabled by the community around him who regarded him as a prophet of God .\nAlthough the FLDS is a separate organization from the larger , mainstream LDS Church , the fact remains that silence from church members , family members , and church leadership allowed the crimes of Warren Jeffs to persist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those wanting to know more about this topic , I recommend watching the documentary series , Keep Sweet : Pray and Obey .\nThe most recent example of accusations against Mormon Church leadership involves the current president of the church , Russel M. Nelson .\nNelson is a retired surgeon who served in various church positions before becoming a member of the LDS Church \u2019 s Quorum of the Twelve Apostles for nearly 34 years , eventually becoming church president in January 2018 .\nNelson is considered a prophet by members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2018 it was reported that a lawsuit was attempting to force Nelson to testify regarding allegations his daughter and son-in-law had been involved in sexual abuse of children .\nFOX13 in Utah reported on the lawsuit : \u201c The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Salt Lake City on Wednesday by six unnamed people listed only as \u201c Jane Doe \u201d and \u201c John Doe \u201d against unnamed \u201c Doe 1 Male Defendant \u201d and \u201c Doe 2 Female Defendant.\n\u201d However , Brenda and Richard Miles \u2019 attorney publicly disclosed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said they vigorously deny the allegations.\n\u201d FOX 13 reports that the lawsuit alleges that in 1985 , a man only identified as \u201c Perpetrator \u201d in the court papers sexually abused his children .\nThe lawsuit claims a 16-year-old babysitter was both a victim and an abuser , and later committed suicide .\nThe plaintiffs allege that \u201c DOE 1 MALE DEFENDANT \u201d and \u201c DOE 2 FEMALE DEFENDANT \u201d ran \u201c touching parties \u201d at their home and the Perpetrator \u2019 s home .\nThese parties were attended by friends of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the children told FOX 13 she reported the abuse to police , but they failed to pursue the case .\nShe also said when LDS Church leaders were told of the incidents they did nothing and an Elder Neal A. Maxwell instructed them to \u201c forgive and forget.\n\u201d \u201c I assumed the highest leaders in the church would want to help my children heal , that the perpetrators would be put in jail .\nI was very quickly disillusioned about that , \u201d she told FOX 13 .\nIt would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Richard Miles , daughter and son-in-law of Russell Nelson .\nJames Jardine , lawyer for the Miles \u2019 , told FOX 13 \u201c there \u2019 s no truth to these allegations .\nThe Miles did not abuse these children or anyone else \u201d .\nJardine said Bountiful Police \u2014 where the abuse is alleged to have happened \u2014 investigated the accusations in the 1980 \u2019 s and concluded there was nothing to the claims .\nThe Miles immediately filed a motion to dismiss the case with the U.S. District Court in Salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attorney representing six unnamed plaintiffs called for an early deposition of LDS Church President Russell M. Nelson .\n\u201c Russell M. Nelson is simply a witness , \u201d Craig Vernon , the attorney for the plaintiffs , told FOX 13 .\nVernon said he was attempting to depose Nelson and Craig Smith , who was the president over the Bountiful ward at the time of the allegations , because James Jardine \u2019 s effort to delay the case until the Utah Supreme Court ruled on the issue of statutes of limitations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nelson was 94 at the time and a delay could endanger the case .\n\u201c Russell M. Nelson has information that \u2019 s relevant .\nHe was there right after this came to light , \u201d Vernon told FOX 13 in December 2018 .\nOn January 6 , 2019 , the LDS Church would release their own statement defending Nelson and pushing back on the idea that he needed to be deposed .\n\u201c Much of the abuse scare has been attributed to an over-reliance on recovered-memory therapy , a disowned practice which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant \u2019 false memories through hypnosis , repetition and the power of suggestion , \u201d the Church wrote .\nTen days later , U.S. District Judge Jill Parrish denied the motion to speed up the deposition of Nelson .\nBy summer 2020 , the case would be dismissed due to a ruling by the Utah Supreme Court regarding statutes of limitations for sexual abuse claims .\nJudge Parrish agreed to dismiss the lawsuit at the request of lawyers for both the six unnamed plaintiffs , and Brenda and Richard Miles .\nThe lawsuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be refiled again .\n\u201c The Miles brought a motion to dismiss arguing that the new ( 2015 ) statute extending the time to sue perpetrators was unconstitutional .\nOur case was stayed so that very issue could be determined by the Utah Supreme Court in Mitchell v Roberts .\nOur case was eviscerated when it was determined that these claims could not be revived and that this statute was unconstitutional , \u201d Craig Vernon told FOX 13 .\nWith the case dismissed with prejudice it is difficult to imagine how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , and , clearly , no one will be held accountable for the alleged crimes .\nThe 2021 Investigation by the UCSO This history now brings us full circle to the current investigation being conducted by the Utah County Sheriff \u2019 s Office .\nFor the last five weeks I have explored various elements of this case , interviewing current and former members of the LDS Church ; speaking with Sgt Spencer Cannon of the UCSO , and poring over the documents related to the 2012 case against David Lee Hamblin .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ updates involving the Sheriff \u2019 s Office investigation .\nI am also still open to receiving emails and messages from those who have a story to share relating to ritualized child sexual abuse in Utah , and elsewhere .\nWhile I can \u2019 t speak to the validity of every single claim made regarding the LDS Church and the apparent abundance of sex rings in Utah , I can say , without a doubt , that these types of criminal activities do happen , and are often dismissed by the propagandized public , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some cases , law enforcement as well .\nThe only way we will ever get to the truth of the claims of ritualized sexual abuse of children is to listen to the alleged victims and conduct independent , transparent investigations into their claims .\nUnfortunately , many of the alleged victims have been ignored for decades , only to be told later in life that the statute of limitations has run out and their abusers can not be held accountable .", "author": "HAF", "url": "https://humansbefree.com/2022/07/utah-ritualized-sexual-abuse-investigation-the-mormon-church-and-child-sexual-abuse.html", "published": "Sun, 10 Jul 2022

"The \u2018Council for Inclusive Capitalism\u2019 is the New World Order", "content": "The idea that there is an agenda for global government among the financial and political elites of the world has long been called a \u201c conspiracy theory \u201d within the mainstream and the establishment media .\nAnd sadly , even when you can convince people to look at and accept the evidence that banking institutions and certain politicians work together for their own purposes , many folks will STILL not entertain the notion that the ultimate goal of these power mongers is one-world empire .\nThey just can \u2019 t wrap their heads around such a thing .\nPeople will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greed alone and that their associations are fragile and based only on individual self interest .\nThey will say that crisis events and shifts in social and political trends are random , not the product of deliberate engineering .\nThey will say that elitists will never be able to work together because they are too narcissistic , etc .\nAll of these arguments are a coping mechanism for the public to deal with evidence they can not otherwise refute .\nWhen the facts become concrete and the powers-that-be admit to their schemes openly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denial .\nThey don \u2019 t want to believe that organized evil on such a scale could actually exist .\nIf it did , then everything they thought they knew about the world might be wrong .\nFor many years the agenda for global governance was only whispered about within elitist circles , but every once in a while one of them would speak aloud in public about it .\nPerhaps out of arrogance or perhaps because they felt the time was right to ease the populace into accepting the possibility .\nWhenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the \u201c New World Order.\n\u201d World leaders from George HW Bush to Barack Obama to Joe Biden to Gordon Brown to Tony Blair and beyond have all given speeches talking about the \u201c New World Order.\n\u201d Money and political elites like George Soros and Henry Kissinger have mentioned the NWO incessantly over the years .\nOne of the most revealing quotes on the agenda comes from Clinton Administration Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbot , who stated in Time magazine that : \u201c In the next century , nations as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all states will recognize a single , global authority\u2026 National sovereignty wasn \u2019 t such a great idea after all.\n\u201d He adds in the same article a lesser known quote : \u201c \u2026The free world formed multilateral financial institutions that depend on member states \u2019 willingness to give up a degree of sovereignty .\nThe International Monetary Fund can virtually dictate fiscal policies , even including how much tax a government should levy on its citizens .\nThe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade regulates how much duty a nation can charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen as the protoministries of trade , finance and development for a united world.\n\u201d To understand how the agenda works , I offer a quote from globalist and Council on Foreign Relations member Richard Gardner in an article in Foreign Affairs Magazine in 1974 titled \u2018 The Hard Road To World Order \u2019 : \u201c In short , the \u201c house of world order \u201d will have to be built from the bottom up rather than from the top down .\nIt will look like a great \u201c booming , buzzing confusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous description of reality , but an end run around national sovereignty , eroding it piece by piece , will accomplish much more than the old-fashioned frontal assault.\n\u201d The \u201c NWO \u201d has since changed names multiple times as the public grows increasingly wise to the conspiracy .\nIt \u2019 s been called the Multilateral World Order , the 4th Industrial Revolution , the \u201c Great Reset , \u201d etc .\nThe names change but the meaning is always the same .\nIn the past two years in the face of extensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d establishment globalists have been talking about has arrived , and with almost no fanfare or mention in the mainstream media .\nThe beginnings of global government already exist , and it \u2019 s called the \u201c Council For Inclusive Capitalism.\n\u201d Lately , many analysts myself included have been highly focused on the World Economic Forum and their role in the global government agenda .\nMainly because WEF head Klaus Schwab is such a loudmouth and he can \u2019 t help but talk about future plans for centralization .\nAs I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the WEF got way too excited about the covid pandemic , thinking that they had the perfect crisis to implement numerous globalist policies in the form of the Great Reset .\nAs it turned out , covid was nowhere near as deadly as they initially predicted during Event 201 , and the public was not as submissive and compliant as they had hoped we would be .\nThe WEF let the cat out of the bag too soon .\nSo , onward we go , with crisis after crisis like dominoes falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they think will drive the masses to accept world governance .\nAnd while the WEF is regularly attended by top level globalists , they are more of a high level think-tank , the Council for Inclusive Capitalism appears to be about implementation rather than theory .\nThe founder of the group is Lynn Forester de Rothschild , member of the infamous Rothschild Dynasty that has long been monetarily involved in influencing governments for generations .\nPope Francis and the Vatican publicly aligned with the council in 2020 , and one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all religions must unite with the leaders of capital to build a society and an economy that is \u201c fair for all.\n\u201d This mission statement is rather familiar , as it echoes the goals of the WEF and its concept of the \u201c Shared Economy \u201d : A system in which you will own nothing , have no privacy , borrow everything , be completely reliant on the government for your survival and you will \u201c like it.\n\u201d In other words , the purpose of \u201c inclusive capitalism \u201d is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version of communism .\nThe promise will be that you won \u2019 t have to worry anymore about your economic future , but the cost will be your freedom .\nThe CIC is led by a core group of global leaders they refer to as \u201c The Guardians \u201d ( No , I \u2019 m not joking , this is real ) .\nMembers of the CIC have included : Mastercard , Allianz , Dupont , the UN , the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America ( TIAA ) , CalPERS , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ & Johnson , Visa , the Rockefeller Foundation , the Ford Foundation , Mark Carney , the Treasurer of the State of California and many more companies around the world .\nThe list is extensive , but what it represents is a kind of corporate led government with a congress of corporate representatives mixed with pliable political leaders .\nOne of the top missions of the CIC has been to change our economic models to \u201c promote equity and inclusion.\n\u201d Hilariously , proponents of the CIC argue that \u201c too much wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too few people and this proves that existing capitalism does not work , yet THEY are the very people that rigged the system to centralize that wealth into THEIR HANDS .\nThey aren \u2019 t \u201c capitalists , \u201d they are an aristocracy .\nDo you really think that these people are going to build a whole new system that doesn \u2019 t continue to benefit them ?\nIf you have ever wondered why the Pope has been pushing woke ideology , climate alarmism and one world religion rhetoric in conflict with traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He \u2019 s following the dictates of the CIC .\nAnother mission of the CIC is to enforce carbon controls and taxation in the name of \u201c climate change \u201d with the purpose of reaching \u201c net-zero \u201d emissions .\nAs we all know , net zero carbon will be impossible without a complete upheaval of our economy and industry , along with the deaths of billions of people in the process .\nIt is an unattainable scenario , which is why it is perfect for the globalists .\nHumans are the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we need to let the elites control our every action to ensure we don \u2019 t destroy the planet and ourselves , and the process will never end because there will always be carbon emissions to deal with .\nMembers of the CIC , including the head of Bank of America , openly suggest that they don \u2019 t actually need governments to cooperate in order to meet their goals .\nThey say corporations can implement most social engineering without political aid .\nIn other words , it is the every definition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massive corporate cabal that works in tandem to implement social changes without any oversight .\nAs noted , we \u2019 ve already seen this with the spread of woke ideology by hundreds if not thousands of corporations working as a hive .\nIs the CIC the final form of global government ?\nNo , probably not .\nBut , it is the beginning of it ; a government by corporations and money elites for corporations and money elites .\nIt bypasses all political representation , all checks and balances and all voter participation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making decisions for our society unilaterally and in a centralized fashion .\nAnd , since big business acts as if they are separate from government rather than partners with government , they can claim they are allowed to do whatever they please .\nHowever , with corporations and globalists increasingly showing their true colors and acting as if they should be in charge , the public must hold them accountable as if they are part of government .\nAnd if they are found to be authoritarian and corrupt , they must be overthrown @ @ @

accelerating the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\u201d This move was seen by many across the world as a \u201c corporate takeover \u201d on the United Nations and was opposed by hundreds of NGOs , non-profits , think tanks , and government officials .\nAn open letter in September of 2019 , signed by these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a move : \u201c The provisions of the

2019 , the WEF \u2019 s influence has grown and their relevance and power within the government has vastly increased .\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic , the WEF put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reset , to use the pandemic to push what they say is a need for \u201c global stakeholders to cooperate in simultaneously managing the direct consequences of the COVID-19 crisis \u201d to \u201c help inform all those determining the future state of global relations , the direction of national economies , the priorities of societies , the nature of business models and the management of a global commons.\n\u201d The Great Reset was written off by fact-checkers as a conspiracy theory despite the WEF advocating for it publicly and the head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a book with that title \u2014 advocating for these very initiatives .\nAfter amassing massive government influence for years , the group , which openly refers to themselves as \u201c elites \u201d has come to the same conclusion that Billy Boy has come to years ago \u2014 we need to block out the sun to slow climate change .\nDiffering from the Gates plan of spraying aerosol particles into the atmosphere to block out the sun , the WEF has gotten behind the MIT proposal to use \u201c space bubbles \u201d to form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be safer \u2013 for instance , if we deflect 1.8 per cent of incident solar radiation before it hits our planet , we could fully reverse today \u2019 s global warming.\n\u201d Another advantage of this particular solar shield is that it is reversible , as the bubbles could be deflated and removed from their position .\nThe spheres would be made from a material such as silicon , transported to space in molten form , or graphene-reinforced ionic liquids .\nFor now , the plan is a working hypothesis and scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lab .\nCiting the highly controversial nature of such geoengineering plans , the WEF fell back on their relationship with the UN to justify it .\nGeoengineering has proven controversial , but the United Nations \u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said it is a necessary Plan B if temperature rises can \u2019 t be capped at a manageable level .\nIndeed , regardless of the assurances of the elite , many scientists and government bodies are making moves to prevent such actions .\nSome countries have even banned the practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sweden recanted on their plan to test Billy Boy \u2019 plan to spray particles in the sky to test blocking out the sun \u2014 citing disagreements among scientists .\nOthers simply want to compensate anyone who is harmed by these projects .\nDavid Keith , a professor of applied physics and public policy at Harvard University , recognizes the \u201c very many real concerns \u201d of geoengineering , according to a report in Forbes .\nTo offset these risks he has proposed the creation of a \u201c risk pool \u201d to collect funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature \u2014 up to and including cooling an area so much that inhabitants are unable to grow food .\nAgain , these temperature decreases bring with them serious risks .\nFreezing temperatures in 1815 led to failed crops in near-famine conditions .\nBritish scientists have cited stratospheric aerosols from volcanic eruptions in Alaska and Mexico as the potential cause of drought in Africa \u2019 s Sahel region .\nMajor disruption of the global climate could bring unintended consequences , negatively impacting highly populated regions and engineering another refugee crisis .\nDavid Keith has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool \u201d to compensate smaller nations for collateral damage caused by such tests , but such a payout might be little comfort to those displaced by unlivable conditions .\nIndeed .\nNo amount of money would compensate for a family losing all of their land to freezing temperatures and being forced to relocate to another country .\nBut these are some of the risks involved in weather modification \u2014 which is why a small group of

significant international corporations that works closely with the CCP .\nAs officials from all over the world , including U.S. President Joe Biden and the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David Beasley , warn of impending food shortages worldwide , the regulation of food production is becoming more strict , and there are even attempts to shut down numerous farms and ranches .\nBut Western nations and many aid-dependent states are tightening regulations even more , rather than loosening them and promoting increased production .\nThis summer , Dutch farmers \u2014 who were already near breaking point

"source": "humansarefree", "title": "Why Are Leftists Obsessed With Destroying Hero Culture?", "content": "In the movie \u2018 Batman : The Dark Knight \u2019 the well regarded district attorney Harvey Dent makes a statement that has since woven itself into our popular culture to the point that we often hear it quoted as if it was said by some ancient philosopher .\nHe noted : \u201c You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.\n\u201d The most predictable interpretation of this is that there is a fine line between doing good and doing evil with the best of intentions .\nPeople can start out as heroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of serving the \u201c greater good.\n\u201d I think there is more meaning behind the quote , however .\nThere is also the issue of historical revision and the fact that the heroes of yesterday might be considered the terrorists of tomorrow given who is in charge of writing the history books or reporting the news .\nSometimes heroes become villains through their own mistakes , other times they are just rewritten that way .\nFor example , today we hear constant gnashing and wailing from the political left about the \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why they should be erased or canceled from our cultural zeitgeist .\nThey have even attempted to revise the very foundations of American history through their \u201c 1619 Project \u201d as they assert that no American accomplishment is valid because EVERYTHING was built around the institution of slavery .\nThey make no mention that slavery has been an institution in every single culture on the planet since civilization began , but that doesn \u2019 t matter to them .\nThe goal of the 1619 Project was to diminish or dismiss everything distinctly American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded our nation .\nWhat they care about is the deconstruction of heroes , in part because if you can destroy the character of a hero then you might be able to also destroy what they stood for in the process .\nAnd , if you can destroy the ideals of a society , it becomes a lot easier to then control that society .\nWhen the political left seeks to undermine the legacy of the founders they aren \u2019 t just engaging in character attacks against men who can no longer defend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sabotage the vision those men created \u2013 The vision of a free republic outside of the dictates of collectivism and monarchy ( rule by the elites ) .\nObviously the Founding Fathers are no longer alive , but there are millions of people that have carried on their legacy for generations that are in fact still living to see their heroes be made into monsters through revisionism .\nBut the destruction of heroes goes even deeper than historical rewrites .\nLeftists are also targeting the very foundations of heroic archetypes and mythologies by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are seeking to change the nature of heroism by hijacking cultural pillars and erasing beloved stories and characters in order to \u201c reboot \u201d them in the image of the leftist cult .\nThis is usually done under the cover of \u201c diversity and equity \u201d as a means to obscure the true agenda .\nLet \u2019 s break down the tactics and motives behind this trend\u2026 Woke ideology does not reflect our modern era in any way ; it is actually a masked version of the old social models of collectivism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displayed by Mao \u2019 s Cultural Revolution .\nThe only difference is today we have online struggle sessions and corporations are fully onboard with the movement .\nWhen leftists claim they are fighting the system , they have no idea what this really means .\nLeftists use the reflection argument all the time to justify the gutting of hero mythologies and replacing them with vapid clones .\nA recent example would be the latest Amazon release of their Lord Of The Rings prequel series .\nI wrote about this extensively months ago in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Of The Rings Is The Death Rattle Of Social Justice Content.\n\u2019 To summarize , the new Lord of The Rings is designed to spread a political message and undermine the values of the past rather than tell a meaningful organic story that pays homage to Tolkien .\nAmazon even released their woke Lord of The Rings on the anniversary of Tolkien \u2019 s death .\nSometimes the propaganda is subtle , and sometimes it \u2019 s a train wreck in your face .\nSpecifically , I examined the political left \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marxism into every new entertainment product as a means to saturate the media space with their ideology .\nWhen they say they want to rehash old stories and old heroes but write them to \u201c reflect the world of today , \u201d what they are really doing is erasing past ideals and principles and eliminating choice .\nThey don \u2019 t want you to see the world from different points of view ; you are only allowed to see it from THEIR point of view .\nThis is the exact opposite of good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It serves no purpose in terms of heroic representations .\nPeople identify with actions and deeds and principles , not skin color .\nLeftists in Hollywood do not actually care about diversity of skin color , they only care about two things \u2013 Using minorities as a crutch to justify poor storytelling and lazy productions , and using minorities as a cudgel or weapon when they face criticism .\nThat is to say , when they make garbage media with no imagination or effort , they announce \u201c we got diversity , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make you want to watch their products anyway , otherwise you might be \u201c racist.\n\u201d By extension , when you dare to criticize the political pontificating and terrible writing in their media , they can then say \u201c our stories are fantastic , you just don \u2019 t like us because we hire brown people.\n\u201d See how that works ?\nThey use minorities as a shield , either for their ineptitude or their malicious intent , but they DO NOT care about such people if they can \u2019 t exploit them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new slave plantation that leftist elites in Hollywood use to farm virtue points and ESG loans .\nThat \u2019 s all there is to it .\nIf they actually respected the idea of presenting diverse heroes , they would create original minority heroes and write them well .\nOr , they would pick minority heroes from real history and avoid implanting current day woke politics into that era .\nIt has long been my contention that the leftist ideology is rooted in appeals to narcissism .\nEverything about it is based in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based in demands for special treatment rather than respect for accomplishment and merit .\nIt is based in equity of outcome while eliminating equality of opportunity .\nA person that has embraced the victim mentality can never be a hero or imagine how a hero would act .\nThey have no relationship to the concept , because narcissists are usually villains in the real world and villains tend to see themselves as victims while they spend their time victimizing others .\nHow else can they justify the evils they do ?\nAs our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the years the depictions of heroes and villains have become utterly twisted .\nHeroes act selfishly with ego and hubris , and villains are usually depicted as either misunderstood people that are only reacting to the trespasses of society , or they are ridiculous exaggerations of conservatives and liberty activists .\nThis trend has become an epidemic in films , television , video games , comic books , etc .\nOnly in the past couple of years has there been mass push-back against the agenda , but there is a long way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the better .\nMany of these woke productions fail miserably , but they aren \u2019 t necessarily interested in box office success or making money .\nAgain , what they care about is saturation , as well as murdering the hero archetype openly where everyone can see .\nThey want to destroy your heroes in front of you and replace them with woke pod people .\nThis is what drives them .\nThe biggest problem is that most conservatives ignored the culture war while only focusing on fleeting political battles .\nThey acted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t matter , and in the process we have almost lost our country completely .\nFuture generations need heroic ideals and examples to live by , among real live people as well as in popular media .\nBy ignoring the culture war , conservatives ignored the future .\nThere are some people out there that are working to change our country \u2019 s course by producing original media with a heroic message based in American foundations of freedom , individualism , self reliance and meritocracy .\nI \u2019 m working to join them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on a survivalist hero .\nThe best we have is Burt Gummer from Tremors \u2013 He \u2019 s great but we need more .\nReaders who are interested in original non-woke entertainment can learn more about that project HERE .\nIt \u2019 s important not to underestimate the power of media in culture .\nThere is a reason why leftists are so obsessive with it ; by changing all our heroes to villains they hope to change our values and our behaviors .\nThey aren \u2019 t just rewriting movies , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are trying to rewrite us .\nThe only way to stop this is to identify the threat , neutralize the propaganda , and then bring back legitimate hero culture by writing it once again with our own hands and our own deeds .", "author": "HAF", "url":

million Jews , she exploiting poor and mentally ill individuals .\nAs TFTP reported , the release of the Paradise Papers , a leak comprised of over 13.4 million documents , exposed the Queens insidious exploits of the mentally ill .\nThe documents included in the leak came from two offshore services providers and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was obtained by the German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche

Chris Addock , chief finance officer of the Duchy of Lancaster .\nThe records show that as of 2007 , the queen \u2019 s private estate invested in a Cayman Islands fund that in turn invested in a private equity company that controlled BrightHouse , a U.K. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of Parliament for selling household goods to cash-strapped Britons on payment plans with interest rates as high as 99.9 percent.\n\u201d According to a report from the Guardian , which partnered in sharing the revelations from the Paradise Papers , over the span of more than a decade at least , the Queen \u2019 s estate has made significant investments in businesses such as the off-license chain Threshers and the retailer BrightHouse .\nIn 2017 , BrightHouse , which is Britain \u2019 s biggest rent-to-own

.\nThe queen was a monarch , an unaccountable , legally immune descendent of a long line of brutal dictators who continued that role \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely \u201c symbolic.\n\u201d Society needs to stop celebrating people like this .\nIf we continue to make role models out of abusive tyrants , don \u2019 t be surprised when society starts to resemble that very thing .", "author": "HAF",

"title": "Greenpeace Founder Patrick Moore Says Climate Change Based On False Narratives", "content": "A series of email exchanges between Greenpeace Founder Patrick Moore and South Korean Professor Seok-soon Park shows him saying that climate change is based on false narratives and that it has become more of a political movement than an environmental movement .\nOne of Greenpeace \u2019 s founding members , Patrick Moore , said in an email why he had quit the organisation : \u201c Greenpeace was \u2018 hijacked \u2019 by the political left when they realised there was money and power in the environmental movement .\n[ Left-leaning ] political activists in North America and Europe changed Greenpeace from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization , \u201d Moore said .\n15 years after he co-founded Greenpeace , Moore left the organisation in 1986 .\n\u201c The \u2018 environmental \u2019 movement has become more of a political movement than an environmental movement , \u201d he said .\n\u201c They are primarily focused on creating narratives , stories , that are designed to instil fear and guilt into the public so the public will send them money.\n\u201d He claimed that they typically carry out their political operations behind closed doors with other operatives at the United Nations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organisations of a similar kind .\nHe asserted that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [ IPCC ] is \u201c not a science organization.\n\u201d The World Meteorological Entity and the United Nations Environment Program make up this political organisation .\n\u201c The IPCC hires scientists to provide them with \u2018 information \u2019 that supports the \u2018 climate emergency \u2019 narrative .\nTheir campaigns against fossil fuels , nuclear energy , CO2 , plastic , etc.\n, are misguided and designed to make people think the world will come to an end unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy .\nThey are now a negative influence on the future of both the environment and human civilization.\n\u201d \u201c Today , the left has adopted many policies that would be very destructive to civilization as they are not technically achievable .\nOnly look at the looming energy crisis in Europe and the UK , which Putin is taking advantage of .\n\u201c But it is of their own making in refusing to develop their own natural gas resources , opposing nuclear energy , and adopting an impossible position on fossil fuels in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization \u2019 s basic values , according to him , were \u201c green \u201d for the environment and \u201c peace \u201d for the people , but peace had largely been forgotten and green had taken precedence .\n\u201c Many [ so-called ] \u2018 environmental \u2019 leaders were now saying that \u2018 humans are the enemies of the Earth , the enemies of Nature.\n\u2019 I could not accept that humans are the only evil species .\nThis is too much like \u2018 original sin , \u2019 that humans are born with evil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even cockroaches , mosquitos , and diseases , \u201d Moore argued .\nThe idea that there should be fewer people in the world is the current dominant philosophy , according to him .\n\u201c But the people who said this were not volunteering to be the first to go away .\nThey behave as if they are superior to others .\nThis kind of \u2018 pride \u2019 and \u2018 conceit \u2019 is the worst of the Cardinal Sins , \u201d Moore said .\n\u201c At the time I decided to leave Greenpeace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Greenpeace International .\nI was the only one with formal science education , BSc Honors in Science and Forestry , and Ph.D. in Ecology .\nMy fellow directors decided that Greenpeace should begin a campaign to \u2018 Ban Chlorine Worldwide.\n\u2019 \u201d Moore argued that although chlorine is one of the 94 [ naturally-occurring ] elements on the Periodic Table and plays many important roles in biology and human health , it is also true that elemental chlorine gas is very toxic and was employed as a weapon in World War I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also known as table salt , is a necessary nutrient for all animals and many plants .\nNaCl can not be \u201c banned.\n\u201d He emphasised that one of the most important developments in public health history in reducing the spread of water-borne communicable illnesses like cholera was the addition of chlorine to drinking water , swimming pools , and spas .\nAdditionally , roughly 25 % of all of our medicines involve chlorine , and about 85 % of pharmaceutical drugs are created using chemistry related to chlorine .\nWithout halogens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iodine , medicine would not be the same .\nHalogens are all potent antibiotics .\n\u201c Greenpeace named chlorine \u2018 The Devil \u2019 s Element \u2019 and calls PVC , polyvinyl chloride , or simply vinyl , \u2018 the Poison Plastic.\n\u2019 All of this is fake [ and ] to scare the public .\nIn addition , this misguided policy reinforces the attitude that humans are not a worthy species and that the world would be better off without them .\nI could not convince my fellow Greenpeace directors to abandon this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point for me , \u201d Moore said .\nMoore responded when asked how Greenpeace used its big contributions , saying money was used to fund \u201c a very large staff \u201d ( possibly numbering over 2,000 ) , extensive advertising , and fundraising initiatives .\nAdditionally , almost all of the organization \u2019 s fundraising advertisements are founded on myths that he had thoroughly debunked in his books , with polar bears serving as one such example .\n\u201c The International Treaty on Polar Bears , signed by all polar countries in 1973 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bears , is never mentioned in the media , Greenpeace , or politicians who say the polar bear is going extinct due to melting ice in the Arctic .\nIn fact , the polar bear population has increased from 6,000 to 8,000 in 1973 to 30,000 to 50,000 today .\nThis is not disputed , \u201d Moore said .\n\u201c But now they say the polar bear will go extinct in 2100 as if they have a magic crystal ball that can predict the future .\nIn fact , this past winter in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from previous years , and Antarctica was colder during the last winter than in the past 50 years.\n\u201d Like many in the \u201c climate emergency \u201d sector , Moore said he does not pretend to be an expert or foresee the future with certainty .\nThe Goal of the \u2018 Environmental Apocalypse \u2019 Theory \u201c I believe the human population has always been vulnerable to people who predict doom with false stories , \u201d Moore said .\n\u201c The Aztecs threw virgins into volcanos , and the Europeans and Americans burned women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would \u2018 save the world \u2019 from evil people .\nThis has been [ referred to as ] \u2018 herd mentality , \u2019 \u2018 groupthink , \u2019 and \u2018 cult behavior.\n\u2019 Humans are social animals with a hierarchy , and it is easiest to gain a high position by using fear and control.\n\u201d Moore added that he is committed to proving to people that the situation is not as dire as they are led to believe that the environmental apocalypse hypothesis is really about \u201c political power and control.\n\u201d \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our descendants are making decisions that our grandchildren will have to pay for , \u201d he said .\n\u201c Predictions that the world is coming to an end have been made for thousands of years .\nNot once has this come true .\nWhy should we believe it now ?\n\u201d \u201c People are naturally afraid of the future because it is unknown and full of risks and difficult decisions .\nI believe there is also an element of \u2018 self-loathing \u2019 in this apocalypse movement.\n\u201d According to Moore , today \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unworthy and are destroying the planet .\nThey now feel guilty and ashamed of themselves as a result of this indoctrination , which is the incorrect attitude to have in life .\n\u201c Very few people believe the world is not warming .\nThe record is clear that the world has been warming since about the year 1700 , 150 years before we were using fossil fuels .\n1700 was the peak of the Little Ice Age , which was very cold and caused crop failures and starvation .\nBefore that , around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Vikings farmed Greenland .\n[ And ] before that , around 500 A.D. were the Dark Ages , and before that , the Roman Warm Period when it was warmer than today , and the sea level was 1\u20132 meters higher than today , \u201d Moore said .\n\u201c Even until about 1950 , the amount of fossil fuel used and CO2 emitted were very small compared to today .\nWe do not know the cause of these periodic fluctuations in temperature , but it was certainly not CO2.\n\u201d Moore made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d is not about the temperature history of the Earth ; rather , the relationship between the temperature and CO2 is the subject of dispute .\n\u201c In this regard , I agree that many believe CO2 is the main cause of warming .\nCO2 is invisible , so no one can actually see what it is doing .\nAnd this \u2018 majority \u2019 are mainly scientists paid by politicians and bureaucrats , media making headlines , or activists making money .\n[ The rest are ] the public who believe this story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what CO2 is doing , \u201d Moore said .\nMoore presented a graph showing the temperature in central England during a period of 350 years , from 1659 to 2009 .\nHe said that \u201c If carbon dioxide was the main cause of warming , then there should be a rise in temperature along the carbon dioxide curve , but it doesn \u2019 t. \u201d In addition to stating that CO2 is the foundation of all life on Earth and that its concentration in the atmosphere is currently lower than it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s history , Moore called the demonization of CO2 \u201c completely ridiculous.\n\u201d \u2018 Wind and Solar Power Are Parasites on the Economy \u2019 \u201c Solar and wind power are both very expensive and very unreliable .\nIt is almost like a mental illness that so many people have been brainwashed to think entire countries can be supported with these technologies , \u201d Moore said .\n\u201c I believe wind and solar energy are parasites on the larger economy .\nIn other words , they make the country poorer than if other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used.\n\u201d According to Moore , companies that provide wind and solar energy heavily rely on government mandates , tax write-offs , and subsidies .\nUnder these mandates , people are compelled to buy wind and solar energy , even if it is more expensive , under the guise that it is \u201c environmentally friendly.\n\u201d \u201c Millions of people pay more for wind and solar energy while a few people make millions of dollars , marks , pounds , etc .\nIt is a bit like a Ponzi scheme in the stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They require vast areas of land , are not available most of the time , and require reliable energy such as nuclear , hydroelectric , [ coal , and natural ] gas to be available when wind and solar are unavailable.\n\u201d According to Moore , the mining , transporting , and building of wind and solar farms need significant amounts of fossil fuels .\nIn many places , they also don \u2019 t generate nearly as much energy during their lifetimes as is needed to construct and maintain them .\n\u201c Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear , hydroelectricity , natural gas , etc . ]\nas the primary source ?\n\u201d Moore questioned , adding if that were the case , \u201c then wind and solar would be unnecessary.\n\u201d \u201c Plastic is not a toxic substance .\nThat is why we package and wrap our food in it , to prevent it from becoming contaminated .\nPlastic does not magically become toxic when it enters the ocean , \u201d Moore said .\n\u201c Of course , they say on one hand that plastic will never break down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , they say it will quickly decay into \u2018 microplastics , \u2019 which , of course , are conveniently invisible so no one can observe or verify this for themselves .\nHow clever !\n\u201d Moore claims that our digestive system can distinguish between \u201c food \u201d and plastic or minute sand particles .\nNo matter how minute the sand is , our body does not absorb it into our bloodstream .\nHe claimed that , like driftwood , floating plastic in the ocean is similar to a little floating reef .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ attach to , lay their eggs on , and eat things that are attached to it .\n\u201c Pollution is usually toxic or causes harm to life .\nPlastic is simply \u2018 litter \u2019 beside the road .\nIt is not hurting anything .\nOne exception is discarded fishing nets , not because they are plastic but because they are shaped to catch fish .\n\u201c The environmental community should work with the fishing industry to stop throwing damaged nets in the sea and bring them back to the dock , where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste-to-energy plant , or discarded safely , \u201d Moore added .", "author": "HAF", "url":

Soros\u2019 Chief Mission is the Downfall of America", "content": "Billionaire George Soros is that rare megalomaniac who not only believes he \u2019 s a god but revels in behaving like one .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a sort of a disease when you consider yourself some kind of god , the creator of everything , but I feel comfortable about it now since I began to live it out , \u201d he once boasted to The Independent .\nThis god complex , combined with his downright amorality and bizarre ideas about society , makes the 92-year-old extremely dangerous to democracies , especially America .\nThe warning comes loud and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , The Man Behind the Curtain : Inside the Secret Network of George Soros , which documents Soros \u2019 s decades of financial dealings , political operations , and nefarious networks .\nEarly in the book , Palumbo highlights Soros \u2019 s amorality , planted perhaps when his Hungarian Jewish family assumed Christian identities and collaborated with the invading Nazis .\nThe teenaged Soros accompanied his phony godfather , who inventoried properties seized from Jewish families sent to concentration camps .\nYet , he says he feels no guilt , only detachment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the property was being taken away .\nI had no role in taking away that property .\nSo , I had no sense of guilt , \u201d he said in a 1998 interview on 60 Minutes .\nHe likened his actions then to his playing the markets later .\n\u201c In a funny way , \u201d he said , \u201c it \u2019 s just like in the markets \u2013 that if I weren \u2019 t there \u2013 of course , I wasn \u2019 t doing it \u2013 but somebody else would \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He recounts that period as \u201c probably the happiest year of my life \u201d and \u201c a very happy-making , exhilarating experience.\n\u201d Besides hubris and amorality , two major ideas drive Soros .\nHe has a personal theory of \u2018 reflexivity \u2019 and the philosophy of Karl Popper , his guru at the London School of Economics ( LSE ) .\nBoth have inbuilt ironies .\nWhile \u2018 reflexivity \u2019 might be just an eccentric speculator \u2019 s hobby horse , Popper \u2019 s ideas , riding on Soros \u2019 s mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world into an anarchist-leftist hell .\nSimply put , reflexivity says the world is very complex , so humans use perceptual shortcuts like generalizations , dichotomies , metaphors , and decision rules .\nThese , in turn , affect reality via the changes they cause in human behavior .\nSoros believes that , guided by this concept , he has gamed the markets by recognizing when perception and reality are at enough variance for betting big .\nLike all \u2018 systems \u2019 to beat the casino , this is humbug and hubris , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceptual shortcomings that , by the premise , afflict everyone .\nBut every successful speculator \u2019 s theorizing gains some indulgence , never mind the informants and networks he \u2019 ll never mention .\nNor is Soros innocent of insider trading , either .\nThat is Soros \u2019 s business .\nWhat should worry us is his obsession with implementing Popper \u2019 s ideas .\nIn The Open Society and Its Enemies , Popper propounded that no single philosophy possesses the truth , no society is superior to another , and \u2018 closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single version of reality .\nIn Soros \u2019 s words , in \u2018 open \u2019 cultures , \u201c nobody has a monopoly on the truth ; a society which is not dominated by the state or any particular ideology , where minorities and minority opinions are respected.\n\u201d This may seem idealistic .\nBut , quoting Eduardo Andino of Philanthropy Daily , Palumbo points out that , if groups must let go of \u201c their truth , \u201d the open society becomes the overarching truth by which its members must live , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others resisting the left \u2019 s anarchic impulses are denounced as authoritarian .\nMuch of that is because Soros funded leftist causes like Antifa , and BLM through his Open Society Foundation ( OSF ) , the NGO he set up with $ 32 billion to spend on disruption .\nHe is the largest donor in American politics , spending billions on political projects in 37 countries through over 50,000 grants .\nWith sociopathic aplomb , he has destabilized and toppled governments , broken currencies , and attacked Western democracies and institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rights , and equity .\nPalumbo calls Soros a \u201c Schrodinger \u2019 s meddler , \u201d both denying and boasting about his activities .\nWhen President Eduard Shevardnadze \u2019 s government fell in 2003 , Soros said it was the Georgian people \u2019 s will , and he had nothing to do with it .\nMonths later , he told the New York Times : \u201c I \u2019 m delighted by what happened in Georgia , and I take great pride in having contributed to it.\n\u201d Soros \u2019 s initial projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a popularly elected president in Ukraine , and anti-Gorbachev interventions in Russia .\nThe last denied Russians , emerging from 70 years of communism , any chance of economic freedom .\nAs a one-size-fits-all globalist , he sees the European Union as \u201c the embodiment of the idea of the open society , \u201d where like-minded states surrender their sovereignty for the common good .\nBut Soros \u2019 s biggest mission is America \u2019 s downfall , which he considers the biggest impediment to an open society .\nHe entered American presidential politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the war on terrorism after 9/11 .\nHe started numerous left-wing organizations to influence America \u2019 s social fabric .\nAs tax-exempt groups , they receive unlimited funds and use them to influence elections .\nUsing his hold on the media , universities , and the White House , Soros has been able to push his ideas on racism ; ecology and conservation ; welfare for illegals ; legalizing drugs ; going soft on crime ; automatic voter registration ; canceling student ; housing ; and medical debt ; and cutting military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socialist agendas , such as increasing government dependency , unionizing all jobs , and advancing racial and gender diversity .\nThis may seem unusual coming from someone who made billions in the markets , but it \u2019 s a potent strategy to destroy the American ideals of competition , merit , and excellence .\nIn 2015 , Soros began backing state prosecutors who want to dismantle the criminal justice system , portraying it \u2013 and America itself \u2013 as systemically racist .\nAccording to him , one should \u201c blame the system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real victim.\n\u201d Around the time BLM was growing , he spent hundreds of millions to back candidates who were anti \u201c law and order , \u201d weak on crime , tough on gun control , and opposed to cash bail .\nAfter donating heavily to Barack Obama \u2019 s Senate and presidential races and pouring money into Hillary Clinton \u2019 s campaign , Soros spent even more to defeat Donald Trump in the 2020 election .\nHe told the World Economic Forum that Trump \u2019 s America First agenda ran counter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money \u2019 s influence in politics , he injected $ 81 million ( including $ 70 million of his own ) through the Democracy PAC .\nUsing the pandemic as an excuse , his funding vehicles sought to increase vote-by-mail , expanding opportunities for vote tampering and harvesting .\nHe war-gamed election outcomes and , visualizing a \u201c despotic \u201d Trump \u2019 s refusal to leave office , started the Transition Integrity Project , a backup plan of civil disobedience and revolutionary protests .\nHe infiltrated the Biden-Harris team even before it took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transition teams of officials to prepare the duo to \u201c hit the ground running \u201d on Day One .\nThe same year , Soros budgeted over $ 63 million to further progressivism in higher education , beginning with the Central European University ( CEU ) in his native Hungary .\nHe also brought together world leaders and Harvard liberals to create a \u201c multilateral economic system where America is not dominant.\n\u201d When Victor Orban forced him out of Hungary for supporting mass refugee resettlement in Europe , he turned to funding universities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s painstakingly researched book also traces Soros \u2019 s hand in the media , including journalism schools \u2013 which is why they push his pet issues and put out \u201c fact checks \u201d to deny his infamous past .\nThus , he can shape narratives and target those who don \u2019 t match his global vision .\nAs he angles to perpetuate his influence beyond the grave , through his son Alexander , his second wife Susan Weber
