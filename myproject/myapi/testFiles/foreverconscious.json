and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking a \u201c thinking detox , \u201d where you focus on stillness rather than allowing your mind to endlessly chatter .\nWhile there are some wonderful , fresh energies on offer

forward .\nMercury Retrograde is a time of reflection and revisiting the past .\nIt is a time when our subconscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface for reviewing and revising .\nWhen Mercury is in Retrograde , we may feel like we are taking steps backward rather than forward .\nKnow that this retrograde energy will be short-lived , as just a few days following this New Moon on February 3rd , Mercury will

also find it easier to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on some of the goals and intentions we have set for the year ahead .\nThe other important factor under this New Moon is the influence of Saturn .\nSaturn will be hovering close to the Aquarius New Moon , exerting its influence .\nSaturn can sometimes be a harsh energy , but this is only because it wants us to take responsibility for ourselves and our actions .\nSaturn requires us to ask the hard questions and to ensure that what we say we want and our behavior is in alignment .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessons , giving us a much-needed reality check .\nWe may be forced to confront something we have not been taking responsibility for in our lives , or we may find we are confronted with a challenge that is necessary in order to achieve our goals .\nKnow that

growing , keep leveling up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lead .\nIf you do notice any challenges or hard obstacles arriving with this New Moon , know that you are being given the stamina to move through it , and on the other side of it , you will be rewarded !\nSaturn always leaves rewards whenever it stirs lessons in our lives .\nWe can also take charge of this energy and use it to persevere on issues that have been troubling us .\nIf you have been navigating something challenging , set some intentions around this New Moon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shine down some support , helping you to find your way through .\nSaturn \u2019 s influence is also a strong cosmic support of longevity , so this will be the perfect New Moon to create long-term goals .\nSaturn can give us the perseverance needed to stand the test of time , so know this is on your side too .\nIf you want to make some long-term commitments in your life , this New Moon would be the perfect time to set some intentions .\nThen after Mercury stations direct , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take action on them .\nSo , even though we do have some challenges here , know there is a lot of cosmic support and rewards too !\nIt is also worth noting that whenever Saturn has been a strong influence in our cosmic skies , we often see further developments when it comes to the pandemic .\nWe may receive some news in regards to the pandemic around the time of this New Moon .\nKnow that it may take Saturn moving out of Aquarius , which happens in March 2023 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !\n( That \u2019 s my prediction anyway ! )\nAnother cosmic force worth mentioning around the time of this New Moon is the harmonious alignment between Jupiter and Uranus .\nUranus is the natural ruler of Aquarius , so it is always worthwhile to see what a planetary ruler is up to under its corresponding New Moon .\nUranus being in harmonious alignment with Jupiter is definitely a positive omen that will help to shift us out of limiting thoughts and into a more hopeful and abundant mindset .\nUnder this Aquarius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I expand my mind to see things in a new way ?\nHow can I clear away self-limiting beliefs and self-doubts in order to make way for new opportunities

leadership qualities and make strong forward movement in your life .\nJust before this moment arrives however , you have to take the time to rest , to reflect , and to get clear on what you want .\nThis clarity doesn \u2019 t come from looking outside of you , but rather making the time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supportive community around you is so important and perhaps you have had moments recently that have really helped you to realize this .\nIf you have been feeling isolated or feel like you have been doing everything on your own , this is your opportunity to reach out and ask for support .\nPisces is a highly compassionate sign , so extend some of this compassion towards yourself and be sure that your needs are being met .\nIf you have been burning the candle at both ends , you may just find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this season too .\nWatch your energy levels , and don \u2019 t forget that there is power in asking for help and creating a supportive community around you .\nYou have a very sharp mind but when the Sun moves into Pisces , things can feel a little foggy and it can be harder to extract the information you are looking for .\nPisces energy can scatter your mind , especially if it \u2019 s full of clutter .\nDuring this Season , work to release some of the unnecessary thoughts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to believe everything you think and not every thought you have is yours to hold onto .\nSpending time in meditation can help with this as can journaling .\nDump all your thoughts out onto paper and reflect on where your mind is at , you may just be surprised what comes through !\nOnce you are done reading over your writing , burn or tear it up as a symbol of release .\nUnder the Pisces Sun , the clearer your mind , the more you are likely to realize .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ right at home when the Sun moves into Pisces .\nThe energy of Pisces has the ability to expand your mind and get you thinking deeper about the things around you .\nThis is an excellent time to study , travel , read , learn something new , or just ponder the deeper meaning of your life .\nIn fact , if there is something you have wanted to learn or try this is a perfect time to take that first step .\nLearning something new can help expand your mind , channel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can also lead to exciting new opportunities .\nPisces energy is highly creative and also supports spiritual pursuits , so both these areas are definitely favored at this time .\nAs a fire sign you are often passionate and full of energy that inspires you to push forward and make your mark .\nUnder the watery energies of Pisces Season however , you are asked to exercise some different muscles .\nYour focus word of this season is Patience .\nBe mindful about rushing ahead into anything you are unsure about or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to really sit with .\nYour intuition will be your guide , so trust the voice of your heart .\nIf something feels off , or if things are not quite right , you may find it beneficial to take pause .\nPisces energy can sometimes cloud things , making it hard to see the truth .\nKnow that the truth will always be revealed in time .\nIf you have a truth you need to share with someone , you may find yourself getting a nudge from the Universe too .\nWe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our cosmic skies recently and you may be feeling the effects of this even more during the season of Pisces .\nIf relationship issues have been on your mind , Pisces Season may amplify things .\nWhile this may bring clarity , it may also muddy the waters too .\nGive things a chance to settle , and trust that clarity will come .\nAlternatively , you may find yourself reaching a new level of growth and maturity in a relationship in your life .\nFor the first time , you may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limitations , and reach a new level of love , understanding or friendship .\nAs your heart is an expansive place this season , be sure to return some of this loving energy your way too .\nPisces Season is your chance to dream !\nIf there is a bigger picture vision you have for your life , or something that you really desire , this is your chance to flesh things out and get clear on what it is that you really want .\nMake a list of all you wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more visual , create a vision board or painting that evokes the feeling space you wish to create in your life .\nWhile Pisces Season is all about ebbing and flowing , you do have some energy on your side that is supporting creating structure and routine .\nIn order to lead the life that you want , you have to start owning and claiming it like it is already yours .\nThis requires you to take some action , so think about what steps you can take , even if they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fellow water sign , you are deeply connected to the cosmic energies that flow when the Sun moves into Pisces .\nAs a Scorpio , you represent \u201c fixed \u201d water , whereas Pisces represents \u201c mutable \u201d water .\nBeing a fixed water sign under a mutable water sign may cause you to feel a little scattered , but see if you can embrace it by allowing yourself to move with the flow .\nEngaging in creative projects can also help to work with some of this cosmic energy .\nIf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and creating a gentle routine may also help to bring a little more stability to your days .\nIf you find yourself getting fixated on something , see if you can bring some of that mutable Pisces energy to the table- how can you choose to see things differently , how can you allow yourself to bend with the way things are flowing ?\nGoing by the textbook in astrology , Pisces energy is not always the best fit for your fiery ways , however I don \u2019 t think this is necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pisces can make you feel a bit scattered or perhaps even uncertain of your way forward , there is so much growth you can achieve by learning to work with its energy !\nIf you have some challenging circumstances in your path , see if you can use the Pisces energy to get

wish to get off the ground , Pisces Season will also give you the creative juice needed to flesh things out .\nPisces is the last sign of the zodiac and is often a time where we can bring closure to any chapters in our lives that we have outgrown .\nThis is a time to evaluate what is really important to you and to ensure that is what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and energy to .\nIf there is something that is draining or depleting you , this season calls for you to let it go .\nPisces energy is highly spiritual , so allow your intuition to be your guide .\nDon \u2019 t force things , but rather set some intentions and then wait for the right inspired actions to follow .\nYou will know what the right steps are when you listen to your heart .\nHappy Birthday !\nThis is your season and your time to

for purchase , such as T-shirts , mugs , toys , etc .\nThe adorable owl image with large eyes and cute round shape has taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen in love with this bird .\nBut what is it that makes owls so special , that makes them stand out from all other bird species ?\nIn many cultures throughout the ages , owls have been considered to have a powerful connection with the spiritual realms

was believed to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient Chinese and the Native American tribes also believed that the owl symbolizes wisdom , and their guidance was used in healing rituals and sacred ceremonies

have the closest connection to .\nWhat makes owls even more fascinating , is that since ancient times , it has been believed that they are guardians of the afterlife , who deliver messages from the

in retrograde since the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving slowly , retracing part of the cosmic skies where it has already traveled .\nThis is known as the shadow phase and happens at the start and end of each retrograde period .\nOn this day , the shadow phase officially comes to an end , and Venus returns to new territory , bringing with it some new energy .\nWhen it comes to our relationships and heart-led matters , Venus leaving its shadow phase can bring some rejuvenating energy .\nThe annual meeting of the Sun and Jupiter is considered one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in astrology !\nJupiter amplifies whatever it touches , and as it comes together with the Sun , it amplifies its life-giving rays .\nIn astrology , the Sun represents the core of who we are , so with Jupiter near it can bring a time

.\nTheir meeting in Pisces is arguably the most intense energetic combination as Jupiter is considered the ancient ruler of Pisces and Neptune is considered the modern ruler .\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cords when moving through Pisces , it allows us to harness the full potential of this energy .\nAlong with revolutions in beauty , art , and fashion , Neptune and Jupiter coming together can inspire new

night sky is scattered with an endless number of stars , but there are four stars that seem to have captured the attention of ancient astrologers .\nThese stars are known as the Royal Stars and include Aldebaran , Regulus , Antares , and Fomalhaut .\nFrom many corners of the globe , these stars seem to hold extra importance and divine significance .\nIt seems that our ancient ancestors were clued into the magic and mysteries that these stars possess .\nIt is even very likely that this knowledge was delivered to them by the star beings themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the guardians of the night sky , and gateways to higher realms of consciousness .\nEach of these fixed stars rests in a corner of our night sky , creating an almost perfect square or perhaps , mapping out an energetic portal .\nThese Royal Stars hold incredibly powerful vibrations and are considered very fortunate and lucky if they are active in your personal birth chart or in our cosmic skies , however , as with all things powerful , they come with great responsibility .\nWhenever the Sun , Moon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes within one to two degrees of these stars , we are able to tap into their wisdom and insights with greater ease .\nAldebaran is the guardian of the eastern sky and is said to be the leader of all stars .\nAldebaran is one of the brightest stars in our night sky .\nAccording to Shamanic Astrology , Aldebaran is home to the Silver Gate , a portal where souls travel as they descend to Earth .\nWorking with the energy of Aldebaran is believed to help facilitate the transformation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enlightenment .\nWhen Aldebaran is activated , it can help us to sharpen our minds and unlock a deeper wisdom and higher truth .\nIt can enhance our intelligence , allowing us to innovate , solve complex problems , and see the world from a higher viewpoint .\nWhile the energy of this Royal Star can be a tonic for our mind and mental health , it can also have the opposite effect too .\nIf we are unconscious of how we use this energy , we can find ourselves with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe intelligence that Aldebaran unlocks can also be used to manipulate , outsmart , or overpower others .\nIn time , this can lead to our own mental destruction .\nAldebaran is active in your birth chart if you have the Sun , Moon , any planets , your Rising Sign , or Midheaven within 1-2 degrees of 9 degrees of Gemini .\nFor all of us , the energy of Aldebaran is most active when it aligns with the Sun , which happens each year from May 29th-31st .\nWork with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by clearing your mind , getting your thoughts out on paper , learning something new , using your thoughts for abundant thinking rather than self-limiting behavior , and meditating on the power of your mind .\nRegulus is the guardian of the northern sky and is known as the heart of the lion .\nIts energy is most active as we cross from Leo Season into Virgo Season .\nThe heart of the lion is courageous , bold , and passionate .\nIts actions are always honorable and noble .\nRegulus is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leaders .\nIn ancient astrology , whenever Regulus was active in the night sky , it was seen as an omen for royal families .\nOn a deeper level however , Regulus is connected to the Crown Chakra ( not just to those who wear crowns ! )\nAs the guardian of the north , Regulus helps us to activate our Crown Chakra , which is our gateway to our higher self and the rest of our lower chakras .\nWhen our Crown Chakra is in balance , the rest of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong Crown Chakra also gives us the awareness that we are part of something bigger than just ourselves .\nOur Crown Chakra can also connect us to the divinity that flows within and all around us .\nWhen Regulus is active in our birth chart , or in the night sky , we can use this energy to facilitate our spiritual growth , follow our passions , and make bold and courageous decisions .\nIf you are born with Regulus within 1-2 degrees of your Sun , Moon , any planets , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to be a born leader .\nWhen you follow your passions and lead with your heart , it can lead to great fame , rewards , and success .\nAs Regulus is aligned with the heart , when you are not following your heart , when you allow your ego to dominate , or when you go against your passions , it can lead to struggles or health issues .\nWhen its energy is used in an unconscious way , your ego can easily become inflated , activating feelings that you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment or recognition .\nStaying on this path can lead to a fall from grace .\nIf you have Regulus strong in your personal birth chart , part of your lesson here is to learn to lead from the heart , and not your ego .\nWe can all connect with the powerful energies of Regulus when it meets with the Sun from August 22nd-25th .\nUse the energy of these days to connect with your Crown Chakra , and activate your life force energy .\nYou can also use this energy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , compassion , and wisdom that is found there .\nRegulus is also considered the star of forgiveness , so you can also use this energy to forgive yourself and others .\nAntares is the guardian of the western sky and is one of the brightest stars we can see with the naked eye .\nIt lies directly opposite Aldebaran , creating a powerful axis .\nIf Aldebaran in Gemini is connected to our mental body , Antares in Sagittarius is connected to our emotional body .\nWhen the Sun crosses this axis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then again from December 2-4 , it can open a stargate , allowing us to receive psychic downloads and balance our mental and emotional bodies .\nIn some cultures , Antares was considered a resting place for souls as they made their journey to the afterlife .\nAntares is closely connected to the energy of Mars .\nMars is fearless , confident , passionate , and bold , but can also be hot-tempered , irritable , and impulsive .\nIf you have Antares active in your birth chart ( within 1-2 degrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any planet , Rising , or Midheaven ) , it can indicate a strong nature and innate confidence .\nYou are likely to be intuitive and very in tune with your feelings , which can help you to lead a life of passion and purpose , however , this can have its drawbacks when your emotional state is out of balance .\nWhen out of balance , the energy of Antares can manifest as obsession , reckless behavior , or acting on impulse .\nThe best way to work with the energy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your emotional state .\nThis may involve talking to a therapist , learning how to protect your energy , meditative practices , and learning the skills needed to properly express and communicate how you are feeling .\nOur emotional body holds a deep wisdom that is connected to our passions , purpose , and sixth sense .\nWhen in balance , we can truly flourish .\nFor all of us , we can connect to the energies of Antares when the Sun aligns with it from December 2nd-4th .\nThis is the perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state and to clear any emotions that are leading to imbalances .\nThis is also a power day to connect with our passions , trust where our feelings may be trying to guide us , and listen to our intuition .\nThe energy of Antares is also a powerful guide for leading a life that is filled with more passion , pleasure , and purpose .\nFomalhaut is the guardian of the southern sky and is sometimes referred to as the loneliest star , as it seems to light up a large stretch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFomalhaut is connected to the return of the light after a period of darkness , and finding the light within ourselves .\nIt is high in the sky during the transitionary seasons of Autumn in the Northern Hemisphere and Spring in the Southern Hemisphere .\nFomalhaut holds a highly transformative energy , reminding us that all things are temporary .\nAll things in this life come and go , but with every death , something is reborn .\nThis process of transformation is a highly creative one , and Fomalhaut is said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the areas of art , music , writing , science , and spirituality .\nIf you have Fomalhaut active in your chart ( within 1-2 degrees of your Sun , Moon , any planet , Rising Sign , or Midheaven ) , there is a strong possibility that your creative or spiritual talents will bring you notability .\nCompared to the other Royal Stars , Fomalhaut is a much softer energy and its vibration seems to be more attuned to our soul energy than to our human body .\nFomalhaut can activate our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intuitive abilities .\nAs it works on a more subtle level , its essence can be difficult to pin down .\nIn fact , this is also part of the nature of Fomalhaut .\nIts nature can make it hard to stay grounded and can lead to escapism or being out of touch with reality .\nPart of the lesson that Fomalhaut offers is to balance the energy between body and soul , and to use our talents for the greater good , rather than for personal gain .\nFomalhaut aligns with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , we can use its energy to strengthen our spiritual connection , work on our creative talents , and to remember that new beginnings are always on offer when something falls away .\nIf you need help understanding your birth chart , check out my book , The Ultimate Guide to Astrology .", "author": "Tanaaz", "url":

of the Fixed Star Algol", "content": "Algol is labelled the most notorious star in our night sky and it is active in our cosmic skies from May 16-18 .\nThe ancients were mystified by Algol .\nIt appeared bright in the night sky , only to disappear and reappear once again .\nWhile I am sure our ancestors were more clued in than we think , we now know that Algol \u2019 s disappearing act is due to the fact that its a binary star that Eclipses itself every few days .\nThis Eclipse motion , or perhaps transformation that Algol undergoes every few days has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star not to be trusted .\nAlgol , is often referred to as the Blinking Eye of the Demon , and is linked with evil , suffering , pain , death , intoxication , and tragedy .\nAlgol and the Myth of Medusa Located in the Persus constellation , which is in the zodiac of Taurus , the notorious star is said to represent the center of Medusas head , or third eye , and is closely connected with her myth .\nIn Greek mythology , Medusa was a gorgon whose hair was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a terrifying sight and anyone who laid eyes on her was petrified and turned to stone .\nBut after having her head chopped off , Medusa became a powerful weapon in battle .\nIf you were standing behind her you were protected , but if you were standing in front of her , you would be cast to stone .\nMedusa wasn \u2019 t always this way .\nShe actually started out as an Oracle Goddess , but was turned into a gorgon by a jealous Pallas Athena .\nPerseus then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave it to Athena to use in battle .\nEven though Athena was her former enemy , it was partly thanks to Medusa that Athena was so successful in her victories .\nUltimately , Medusa became more powerful after she died .\nThere is also some irony that she ended up being Athena \u2019 s secret weapon after their heavily conflicted relationship .\nMedusa is a powerful symbol of magic , transformation , and feminine power .\nWhile she is a monster , her hair of snakes wards off evil and enhances her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her decapitated head was said to birth new life and was linked to the magic of the menstrual cycle .\nIt seems that even though Medusa \u2019 s story saw her as a Goddess turned gorgon , she became mighty and powerful , either protecting or killing those in her path .\nEven if you are not well versed in Greek mythology , most people are aware of Medusa and her enchanting hair of snakes .\nShe is a memorable character and one that deserves to be understood a little deeper .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a sinister reputation is almost no surprise in this patriarchal world .\nIf Algol embodies the energy of Medusa , it embodies the monster but also the goddess , the oracle , and the incredible power of transformation .\nIf we look a little deeper into the mythology behind Medusa , we can see that her story is definitely tragic .\nHere we have a Goddess , who by no fault of her own , was turned into a gorgon , decapitated , and then used for her incredible powers of protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her transformation from Oracle Goddess , to monster , to a decapitated head , she was able to hold her power .\nMedusa rebirthed herself and through every transformation , she only became stronger .\nLooking at Algol in a New Way Rather than looking at Algol as a star of tragedy , we can look at it as a star of transformation , magic , protection , and power .\nAlgol often makes an appearance in the chart of radical artists and entrepreneurs .\nIt was prominent in Picasso \u2019 s chart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his time .\nIt was also strong in Princess Diana \u2019 s chart too , who although suffered a tragic end , is remembered today for her saint-like actions and the bravery it took to stand up to the monarchy .\nAlgol is certainly not all that bad .\nResting at 26 degrees of the tropical Taurus Zodiac , Algol is our reminder that despite any tragedies , we too hold great power .\nWe too can rise again , transform , and find a new purpose no matter where life takes us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhen its energy is used consciously , it is incredibly powerful and can be a strong portal of psychic and physical protection .\nIn fact , many wear the head of medusa as a powerful talisman to ward off oncoming evil , and we can view Algol in the same way .\nWorking with the Energy of Algol From May 16-18 , when Algol aligns with the Sun and is strongest in our cosmic skies , see if you can connect with the protection , power , and magic that it brings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy as a reminder that despite your own transformations , you too can come out stronger .\nAlgol can be used to build strength , raise our confidence , and to step into our feminine power with greater ease .\nIt can also heighten psychic abilities and be used to clear negativity from our energy field .\nUsing Algol in a positive light helps to rewrite its story and shine a new light on the dark feminine .\nRather than being the most notorious star linked with horrors , we can see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of transformation , awakening , protection , and owning one \u2019 s power .\nAlgol sits at 26 degrees of topical Taurus .\nIf you have any planets or sacred angles ( Ascendant , Descendant , Midheaven , or Nadir ) within 1-2 degrees of 26 Taurus , then the energy of Algol is a resource you can tap into .\nThe same applies if your birthday falls between

believed that when a planet entered retrograde it was traveling through the underworld , or our subconscious , unearthing hidden messages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the shadows .\nPluto is considered the Lord of the Underworld , so this enhances the shadowy energy .\nIn a sense , the keeper of the underworld himself is being invited to look over his own shadows , his ignored intuitive messages , and his

\u2019 s retrograde is that it will once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States .\nPluto first made this alignment in the United States chart on the auspicious 22nd of February 2022 , but will now revisit , helping to dig up and unearth any skeletons or shadows in the closet that need to come to light .\nYou can read more on the Pluto Return of the United States here .\nInterestingly , this is also the third last time Pluto will Retrograde in the sign of Capricorn .\nThis means that it is getting ready after 10+ years to wrap up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As this journey comes to an end , its lessons are only going to intensify .\nPluto is a transformative force and rules over the cycle of death and rebirth .\nWhile in Capricorn it has been working hard to bring change to powerful corporations , governments , long-established financial intuitions , and the world of big business- all areas that are touched by the combination of Pluto and Capricorn .\nPluto still has much to do of course , but hopefully by the time Pluto leaves , the collective would have used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transformations in these areas .\nIn our own lives , Pluto entering Retrograde is a time when we can reflect on our own transformative journey .\nPluto \u2019 s last retrograde ended in October 2021 , so since this time , how have you transformed ?\nHow have you used the energies of Pluto to confront your shadows and come out stronger and reborn ?\nPluto embodies the process of death and rebirth .\nIt is always present in those moments in life when we undergo the process of moving from maiden to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darker more painful sides of these transformative journeys can sometimes come to our attention under a Pluto Retrograde .\nWhile we become more sensitive to them and how they have moved and changed us , they also allow us to gain clarity and strength around just how far we have come .\nIf you made big , life-altering decisions in October 2021 , or if a significant event happened close to that month , you may find that new insights are revealed to you , or perhaps a new way of approaching things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpful way to look at it would be to think of Pluto stationing direct in October 2021 as the rebirth stage of your transformation journey and the retrograde as sort of the death or end stage .\nChange , endings , and the idea of loss can always be a scary thing , but remember , Pluto \u2019 s energy is often subtle and delicate .\nIts slow movements give us time to adjust , time to grieve , and time to pause and figure out what we need to get done .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is our opportunity to slowly and steadily clear the path , reinvent things that have become stagnant , and keep leveling up on our journey through this incarnation .\nIt is also interesting that just a day after Pluto enters retrograde , we have the first Eclipse of 2022- the Taurus New Moon Solar Eclipse .\nEclipses always represent change and transformation , and often unlock doors to higher states of consciousness .\nCouple this with Pluto \u2019 s entrance to the underworld , and we definitely have a strong theme that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBy the time Pluto stations direct again on October 8 , 2022 , we will have a much clearer understanding of our next chapter on the always constant road of transformation .\nWe are likely to find ourselves ready to begin a new stage of our lives , free from whatever past shadows we have worked on .\nAnd if it \u2019 s anything , it \u2019 s nice to remember that pictures of Pluto show a love heart pattern on its surface , showing us that through every transformation a deeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Energy of Pluto Retrograde Retrogrades are often strongest at the time they start and the time they end , so April 29 and October 8 , 2022 , are the best windows of opportunity we have to use the energy of Pluto Retrograde .\n\u2022 Assess your life since October of last year , what changes have been made and how do these changes need to be tweaked or adjusted ?\n\u2022 Get in touch with your shadow side , what needs to be shown the light ?\n\u2022 Confront what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer has to hold power over you \u2022 Release what is no longer in your control \u2022 Release any shadows from your past that are contributing to blockages or pain \u2022 What is no longer working in my life\u2026", "author": "Tanaaz", "url":

can join her for more on crystals on her YouTube channel .\nThere are two types of Eclipses \u2013 Lunar and Solar Eclipses .\nA Lunar Eclipse occurs when Earth moves between the Sun and the Moon .\nWhen this happens , Earth blocks the sunlight that normally is reflected by the Moon .\nIn other words , Earth \u2019 s shadow falls on the Moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moon moves between the Sun and Earth .\nWhen this happens , the Moon blocks the light of the Sun from reaching Earth .\nSo we can see the Moon cast a shadow onto Earth .\nAs the Sun or the Moon falls into the darkness during an Eclipse , our own hidden emotions may rise up from deep within us .\nThat is why Eclipses are great times to connect with our shadow side , work with our fears , and tend to our unhealed wounds .\nEclipses tend to bring sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our higher purpose .\nDuring these times , things might feel a bit confusing and volatile , so the best thing to do is to trust your intuition and give yourself extra self-care .\nA great way to soothe your soul and ease tensions during the Eclipses is to work with crystals .\nCrystals can help calm our minds , enhance our inner peace , and connect us with the spirit world .\nThere are so many wonderful ways to work with crystals , such as meditating with them , creating your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as jewelry .\nThe following is my intuitive selection of 3 crystals for the Eclipse Season\u2013 Since ancient times , Serpentine stones have been associated with snakes .\nSome tribes used to wear this stone to protect themselves against snakebites and to ward off evil spirits .\nSerpentine was also used in shamanic rituals to connect its wearer with the healing energies of Mother Earth .\nEven today , it is believed that Serpentine has magical properties .\nPerhaps the most well-known of these properties is its ability to surround its wearer with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also one of the best stones for activating Kundalini energy .\nThe energies of Eclipses tend to be quite intense and full of surprises .\nWorking with a Serpentine stone during a Lunar or a Solar Eclipse helps us adapt to change and overcome the fear of the unknown .\nSerpentine teaches us to embrace changes , as they can be blessings in disguise , helping us to transform our lives for the better .\nThe mesmerizing light and dark green patterns of Serpentine remind us that darkness can be transformed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent , everything is constantly shifting .\nThat is why , at times of change , it is best not to force things , but surrender to the flow and allow things to take their course .\nHold a piece of Serpentine in your hands during meditation to transform any negative thought patterns you may have into more uplifting ones .\nEclipses shine a light on the things in our life that are not aligned with our soul purpose .\nAnything that exits your life during an Eclipse , was probably not meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your life , it is for your highest good , so be open to it .\nThese unexpected changes and sudden shake-ups can feel a bit overwhelming , so be patient and gentle with yourself .\nOnce the Eclipse energies have passed , things usually become clearer and you will regain your sense of direction .\nThe nurturing and comforting energy of Dolomite crystal teaches you the importance of self-love and self-acceptance .\nWorking with this crystal helps dissolve fears and energetic blockages caused by traumatic experiences .\nDolomite \u2019 s subtle healing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deep emotional detox .\nAs a crystal of inner peace and tranquillity , Dolomite teaches you to trust yourself and to trust life .\nIt reminds you to enhance your connection with your higher self by meditation , prayer , reciting mantras , or engaging in other soul-soothing practices .\nThat way , you will never feel completely alone , for deep within , you will know that there is a bigger plan and a higher purpose to everything that happens .\nYou can relax , knowing that you are always safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the energies of the Eclipses tend to be a bit unsettling , we all need some extra grounding during these times .\nSpending time in nature , doing some gardening , hugging trees , and walking barefoot are all great ways to ground your energies .\nSome crystals also have powerful grounding energies .\nOne of the best examples is Hematite \u2013 a crystal that grounds you firmly to the earth and fills you with a sense of stability .\nWorking with a Hematite crystal during a Lunar or a Solar Eclipse gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenges and to keep moving forward .\nHematite teaches you to step into your power and to stand your ground for what you believe in .\nThe potent energies of this crystal help you to break free from addictions and to set healthy boundaries .\nHematite encourages you to explore your shadow side and uncover the deep-rooted fears that are holding you back .\nIt reminds you to accept your own darkness and to transform your trauma into strength and courage .\nSit comfortably in a quiet space .\nRelax your body and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of times .\nTake one of the above-mentioned three crystals and hold it in your hands .\nAsk the crystal to clear away any negative energies that might be lingering in your energy field .\nClose your eyes and visualize a brilliant white light surrounding your entire body and cleansing your aura .\nNow , think about your deepest fears .\nAsk yourself , whether these fears are helping you in any way or whether they are holding you back from living your life to the fullest ?\nIf you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much power over you , perhaps it is time to release it .\nGive an intention to the crystal to transmute the fear into love and light .\nYou can say the intention out loud or quietly in your mind .\nTrust that the wisdom and power of the crystal is helping you release the things that are not aligned with your soul path .\nNow open your eyes and recite the following

constellations in our night sky .\nIt is visible from every corner of the world and lies close to the celestial equator .\nIn many cultures , Orion is considered a constellation that brings strength and perseverance .\nIt is linked with fertility , death , and protecting all of life .\nIt is also interesting to note that the Great Pyramids in Egypt , the Pyramids in Teotihuacan , and the Xi \u2019 an Pyramids of China are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constellation .\nAstrologers have marked 13 fixed stars in the constellation of Orion , including the brightest stars- Rigel , Bellatrix , and Betelgeuse .\nOur Sun meets with these stars on June 7 , June 11 , and June 20 respectively , making it a power time to connect with the protective and fortifying energy of Orion , however out of all the fixed stars in this constellation , there was one that I felt intuitively drawn to , and that is Mintaka .\nMintaka is one of the three stars that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mintaka is the closest star to the celestial equator , and while it is not the brightest , many feel connected to its energy and that it was once their original star home .\nOn June 13 , the Sun aligns with Mintaka , activating its energy and perhaps the forgotten memories of the lost water world that it used to be .\nMintaka was believed to be a peaceful place filled with crystal clear water that was light and airy , and much easier to move through than the water on planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many feel that the idea of mermaids or merpeople comes from our collective subconscious and the forgotten memory of the Mintakans and how they used to live .\nThe story goes that the beautiful place of Mintaka was destroyed , forcing the Mintakans to relocate to planet Earth .\nMany starseeds of Mintaka report feeling a longing for a place that no longer exists or homesickness they can \u2019 t explain .\nThey also feel very connected to water and love to be near the ocean .\nIn astrology , Mintaka is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tropical zodiac of Gemini .\nIt brings strong intellect , wisdom , and the perseverance of higher knowledge .\nWhen Mintaka is active in our cosmic skies , like on June 13 when it aligns with the Sun , our mental energy

, and to ask new questions .\nMintaka gives us a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to push further and get to the heart of things .\nAs the old saying goes , a mind expanded can never go back to its old dimensions , and that is what Mintaka can help us to realize .\nOn June 13 , as the Sun aligns with Mintaka , keep your mind and third eye open .\nSee what new insights , new wisdom , and new information floats your way .\nAllow your mind to be stretched to new heights and new beliefs .\nRecognize any limitations you have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be shifted with a fresh perspective .\nThe energy of Mintaka is particularly helpful if you are studying or need to tackle a project that requires a lot of brainpower .\nIf you are looking for more mental stimulation in your life , Mintaka may just bring the right project or opportunity your way .\nMental expansion is also about our imagination and allowing it to wander into daydreams , visualizations , and storytelling .\nOur imagination is really an untapped superpower .\nWhen we allow our imagination to take over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intuition , boost our creativity , and come up with new and insightful ideas .\nIn fact , one of the first steps to strengthening your intuition and increasing your psychic gifts is to allow your imagination to take over !\nVery often it is the same muscle that allows our imagination to take over that helps us connect to our natural intuitive and psychic abilities .\nA good exercise to try to work with the concept is to think of a question you would like your intuition to answer .\nWrite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then use your imagination to come up with an answer .\nDon \u2019 t worry about it being wrong or right , just allow your imagination to take over .\nAfter you have written down your answer from

.\nIllusions can come crashing down , and deceits can be exposed .\nNeptune Retrograde can reveal things that were hiding or that we perhaps didn \u2019 t want to see .\nThis particular Neptune

rose-colored glasses off if we have been wearing them , and face up to the truth .\nAs Neptune rules over spirituality , its retrograde period is also a good time to reflect on your spiritual journey and whether or not you are walking in alignment with your soul .\nWithout the veil of illusion surrounding us , Neptune Retrograde allows us to see where we may have been falsely led on our spiritual journey , or where we have been leading with our ego rather than love .\nNeptune is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unconditional love that is beyond our relationships and is connected to the forever part of our

from the North Node gives us some reassurances that it \u2019 s leading us to a higher future ; that it \u2019 s helping to unlock events that can help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just on an individual level , but

\u2019 t emerge from the water without a lot of rumbling and shaking .\nDiscovering a whole new continent can also rattle our own beliefs , or change the way we have been thinking about the world .\nWhatever unfolds under this fated alignment , it is important to remember that Uranus is the planet of awakening .\nWhile it can bring unsettling information or even shocking information at times , it does so to awaken our minds , to push us further , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boundaries and restrictions .\nUranus is responsible for activating our Kundalini energy , for opening our third eye , and ascending to higher levels of consciousness .\nThe energy of Uranus can spark innovation and lead to radical new ideas .\nAs it joins with the North Node , we can use its energy to free ourselves from all that is holding us back , to give grounded energy to our radical ideas , and to move from a more awakened and mindful state .\nThe North Node is not a planet or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculated between the Sun and Moon .\nIt is a sacred , karmic point in any chart , and as it \u2019 s activated by Uranus , we are all getting a shake-up to move us to our highest destiny and a higher expression of our

July-December 2022", "content": "Chiron enters retrograde on July 19 , 2022 , joining Saturn , Neptune , and Pluto .\nAll of these cosmic bodies retrograde annually , so this energy is part of the natural rhythm we experience each year .\nChiron adding to the retrograde mix however , brings a new dynamic to work with and shifts its energy to the forefront .\nThis is especially true the day Chiron goes Retrograde , and the day it stations direct , which occurs on December 23 .\nThe day a planet goes retrograde and then direct again are the power days to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can work with its energetic expression with greater ease .\nChiron is not technically a planet but an asteroid that orbits between Saturn and Uranus .\nEven though Chiron is not a planet , in astrology , it is still a significant cosmic energy to work with .\nChiron is a centaur , and the myth goes that Chiron was abandoned at birth and left to fend for itself .\nIt was through this wound of abandonment and difficult upbringing that it was able to rise up and turn its wounds into powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s wounds that paved the way for its role as a powerful healer , teacher , psychic , and philosopher .\nThis is why Chiron is referred to as the wounded healer .\nWe all possess the same powers as Chiron .\nInside each and every one of us , we have the ability to take our wounds and pain points and turn them into a source of power .\nAs the poet Rumi says- the wound is where the light enters you .\nThe position of Chiron between Saturn and Uranus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it brings .\nSaturn is a very grounded , rooted energy , whereas Uranus is considered a planet of a higher vibration .\nUranus \u2019 energy can also bring about awakenings and the rise of kundalini energy .\nChiron can act as a bridge between these two states of being and is sometimes referred to as the Rainbow Bridge .\nThe Rainbow bridge signifies the linking between one state of consciousness and the next , and this idea is further amplified if we look to Egyptian Astrology .\nIn ancient Egyptian Astrology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anubis , the god of the afterlife and lost souls .\nA lot of the myths and legends that are used in Western Astrology can be traced back to Egyptian and Babylonian astrology , and Anubis can be seen as Chiron \u2019 s counterpart .\nJust like Chiron , Anubis was abandoned as a child .\nIt was through this painful upbringing that Anubis was also able to rise up into the noble profession of the Guardian of the Underworld .\nIt was the job of Anubis to welcome the newly dead to @ @ @ @ @

discernment , and loyalty to walk souls through such a journey .\nAs Chiron or Anubis travels retrograde , we can access our own wounds to reflect on how to use them as a source of power and healing .\nThis energy is not about obtaining a state of perfection through healing , rather it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our wounds in a way that allows us to access the wisdom they can bring .\nChiron doesn \u2019 t want us to heal because it will make us \u201c better \u201d .\nIt wants us to learn how to source these wounds as powerful portals of wisdom , knowledge , and power .\nBy extracting this information

more beneficial to allow our wounds to inspire , motivate , and offer strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as something that slows us down or makes us inferior in any way .\nWounds are painful , and some wounds cut so deep that they never truly leave us , but this is ok.

but has been updated for 2022 .\nWhat is the Lionsgate 88 Portal ?\nThe Lionsgate 88 Portal is the opening of a galactic gate that delivers high-frequency energy into our beings , allowing us to rebirth our spirit energy and the spirit energy of Mother Earth .\nThis high-frequency energy can be used to open our energy centers , inspire new ideas , raise our consciousness , and enhance our ability to receive psychic downloads .\nHow is the Portal Activated ?\nThe Lionsgate Portal is activated by the the rising of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the end of July all through the middle of August , however the numerology of 8/8 , and the Sun reaching the halfway point or 15 degrees of the Leo zodiac at this time ( the peak of Lion energy ) , has made it the day we celebrate the portal .\nSirius is considered our Spiritual Sun , so the rising and return of Sirius was seen by ancient astrologers as the rebirth of our spirit energy and the spirit energy of the planet .\nThe rising of Sirius also corresponded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Nile , further supporting this idea of rebirth through the nourishing rain .\nSome cultures also used the rising of Sirius to signify the start of the new year .\nTell me more about Sirius\u2026 Sirius is one of the brightest stars in the sky and is known as our Spiritual Sun .\nWhile our earthly Sun illuminates our physical world , which is an illusion , our Spiritual Sun illuminates the truth of our timeless soul .\nThe ancients were very in tune with the star Sirus , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the home of higher vibrational beings .\nThey believed the energy of Sirius carried highly advanced wisdom that we could tap into and utilize whenever Sirius was strong in the sky .\nWhile our Sun is responsible for beaming down life for our physical bodies , Sirius is responsible for beaming down life for our spiritual bodies .\nThis is why the opening of the Lionsgate Portal can bring awakenings and lift our consciousness to new heights .\nIn modern astrology , Sirius is associated with freedom and advanced technology .\nWhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerology represents infinity and DNA activation , allowing us to take this Sirius energy and infuse into the very core of our being .\nWe can also unlock and upgrade the memory of our cells allowing us to bring more healing , peace , and love into our being .\nThink of the \u201c Hidden Messages in Water \u201d by Dr. Emoto , which captured the shape of water crystals based on the vibration of their surroundings .\nOur body is mostly water , and millions of those water crystals live within us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy to ensure our crystals are vibrating harmoniously , and are whole and complete in their structure .\nThe number 8 also represents infinity \u2013 the infinite soul that we are and the infinite journey that we take .\nWhy is it called \u201c Lions \u201d Gate ?\nThe Rising of Sirius , which ancient astrologers celebrated as the rebirth of Spirit , happens to occur right in the heart of Leo Season , which is ruled by the Lion .\nOn August 8 , the Sun is just past 15 degrees of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zodiac .\nReaching this halfway mark also signifies the midpoint between the June Solstice and the September Equinox .\nReaching this halfway mark is said to thin the veil between the realm of spirit and the \u201c 3D world \u201d .\nWhat channeled messages around Lionsgate have you received ?\nIn channeled messages , it was shared with me that the Lionsgate Portal is closely connected to the Atlanteans .\nWhile this didn \u2019 t make sense at first , through some investigating , I discovered that there is a theory that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the bottom of the Sphinx .\nWhile no chamber has ever been discovered , the theory is that as Sirius rises , it acts as a key to unlock this chamber and the information from the Atlanteans .\nIt is not clear if this information is intuitively downloaded and received to those who are open to it , or if there are physical scrolls , tablets , or crystals in an actual chamber .\nAs mentioned , no such chamber has ever been discovered ( yet ! )\n, however receiving that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this journey of discovery- so make of it what you will !\nIs the Lionsgate Portal 88 portal for dark magic ?\nAll star portals , galactic gateways , or cosmic events can be used for dark magic if that is what is intended .\nThe Lionsgate 88 Portal energy is powerful , but it is there for us to use to celebrate the rebirth and return of our spirit energy .\nYou can use the Lionsgate Portal to call back all the pieces of your spirit that you feel have been lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can use the Lionsgate Portal to rebirth your energy and to feel good inside your body .\nHow you use this energy is up to you , so use your intuition when working with the energy and try not to feed any negative thoughts .\nHere are a few things we can set an intention to experience under Lionsgate : \u2022 Heart healings : the Lionsgate portal activates the heart chakra .\nOld or even current wounds of the heart may rise up for healing .\nWe may finally feel free from any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts .\nFor more guidance with this , read How to Open and Clear Blocks in your Heart Chakra .\n\u2022 Third eye awakenings : the Lionsgate portal also activates the third eye chakra .\nWe may feel more intuitive or learn something new about the way our intuition speaks to us .\nOur intuition is likely to be strong and if this is something we want to work with more , the Lionsgate portal is a great time to begin .\nFor more , read how to Open and Activate your Third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : while we have seven main chakras or energy centers in our body , we also have hundreds of smaller , more sensitive chakras that can be activated and awakened during the Lionsgate Portal .\nThis helps us to tap into new wisdom and higher spiritual knowledge .\n\u2022 Psychic downloads : with the high vibrational energy from Sirus beaming our way , we are more likely to receive psychic downloads .\nThese can come through our dreams , visions , spirit guides and angels , or through simply hearing things while in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automatic writing are great ways to open to this energy and to receive guidance .\n\u2022 Visitations : the ancients believed that Sirius was home to heaven , angels , and otherworldly beings .\nUnder the Lionsgate Portal energy , we are more likely to receive messages , dreams , signs , and visits from our loved ones who have passed and from our spirit guides and guardian angels .\nEncountering alien beings may also be more likely too .\n\u2022 Freedom : one of the strongest vibrations from Sirius is this energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our earthly Sun illuminates this physical world which is an illusion .\nBut Sirius illuminates our soul and spiritual bodies , which is the truth .\nBy understanding this , we gain a sense of freedom .\n\u2022 Peace : Sirius has very peaceful vibrations too , so spending time in nature and meditation is a great way to tap into this peaceful energy and use it for healing and restoring your mind , body , and soul .\n\u2022 Technology : Sirius is also associated with highly advanced technology .\nIf you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to start a website , blog , app , or anything else related to technology , this would be great energy to use to your advantage .\n\u2022 Creativity : Lionsgate is also a highly creative time and the perfect opportunity to try a new creative project or to take action on a creative project you have been looking to get off the ground .\n\u2022 Crystal Readings : To guide you through the Lionsgate Portal energy , I have teamed up with Elina Allais to create a digital download crystal reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be shown three crystals .\nUsing your intuition you will choose the image you resonate with the most and receive a guided message .\nCheck out your digital download here .\nFor best results , use after any of the Lionsgate Rituals provided below .\nThe energy of Lionsgate can connect us with the cosmic skies , galactic frequencies , higher dimensional beings , and our own intuition .\nIt can also activate heart healings , the expansion of spiritual wisdom , and help us awaken to our true potential .\nOn Lionsgate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to use this energy , and then create a ritual or practice that allows you to harness and work with it .\nTo guide you with this , I have some guided meditations and ritual resources for you here :", "author": "Tanaaz", "url": "https://foreverconscious.com/the-lionsgate-88-portal", "published": "Tue, 26 Jul 2022

?\nEven the smallest acts of love towards yourself count !\nFalling in the earthy sign of Virgo , there is a grounded energy to this New Moon .\nIt beckons us to sink our feet into the earth , to feel a part of all that surrounds us , and to remember that life is so much easier when we flow in harmony with the season of our lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Moon , to accept your reality , to bring yourself back down to Earth , and to recognize that your soul chose to be here , on this planet , at this time .\nIt doesn \u2019 t really matter the reason , but knowing you are walking where you are meant to be walking , even if it doesn \u2019 t feel like it , can bring a sense of peace into your being .\nAllow yourself to find truth in that idea , whatever that looks like for you .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept that you are right where you need to be , and all that is unfolding right now is leading you to your highest growth and highest expression of your soul .\nVirgo is represented by the Virgin Goddess , and she is our guide under this New Moon energy .\nThe Virgin Goddess is really a symbol of wholeness .\nShe is whole and complete in herself .\nShe is full and satisfied in her being .\nShe is the source of her own wisdom .\nThe Virgin Goddess reminds us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember that all that we need can be found from within , we just have to take the steps to listen and honor our mind , body , and soul .\nWe just have to learn to treat our body as the sacred temple that it is .\nOne of the best ways to use the energy of the Virgo New Moon is to think about ways we can all embody the idea that our body is our temple .\nHow can you treat yourself as the sacred being that you are ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSimply listening to your body and the innate wisdom that rises up from within .\nYour body can be a messenger if you are paying attention and if you are listening to your intuition .\nAsk your Higher Self , Angels , Guides , or even Mother Moon to send you a sign if you are dealing with some health problems that don \u2019 t seem to have a clear answer .\nAsk your body to reveal what it needs , and trust the wisdom that arises .\nSometimes this wisdom will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat ,

support you all the way .\nMars , the planet of action , energy , and fire , is very active under this New Moon .\nThe energy of Mars can sometimes make us feel a little irritable and stir where we may be holding on to fears and insecurities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , making us short on patience and easily frustrated .\nBeing aware of this can help you to be compassionate towards yourself and others if you notice any of these feelings arise .\nOn deeper levels however , Mars often stirs these less pleasant emotions in us when we have unresolved fears and insecurities that are preventing us from speaking our truth and doing what we want to do .\nMars can trigger where we have held ourselves back out of fear or insecurity .\nEssentially , any frustration or irritability we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been standing up for ourselves , following our heart or passions , or staying in our authentic truth .\nIf you feel yourself getting a little irritable , ask yourself where it may be really coming from and be mindful of taking it out on the wrong people .\nIf nothing else , Mars energy can also be channeled into physical activity , and with the Moon in Virgo , you could also take this opportunity to do a deep cleaning or reorganizing of your space .\nWhen we work productively with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the confidence and stamina needed to push past our fears and address what is really

.\nMercury will enter retrograde in the air sign of Libra , making its way back into the earth sign , Virgo , on September 23 .\nAs Mercury Retrograde travels through Libra , we may notice themes

relating to our health .\nBefore we unravel how these themes may manifest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Retrogade is and why it is part of the natural cycle and rhythm of the cosmos .\nMercury is considered the messenger of the Gods .\nAncient astrologers believed that when Mercury was retrograde , he would slip into the underworld , heightening our subconscious mind and intuition , and bringing to the surface hidden , lost , or forgotten messages .\nMercury Retrograde is a time when energy shifts to an internal state , allowing us to go within and listen to our own inner world rather than the voices of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to reflect and look back over the past before proceeding ahead .\nAs Mercury is considered the planet of thoughts , communication , technology , and travel , its retrograde phase can sometimes create delays , indecision , mishaps , and miscommunications .\nWhile these sorts of things can happen at any time , it is always considered a sign from the Universe to pay attention if they happen under Mercury Retrograde \u2019 s spell .\nWhat messages could Mercury be trying to deliver to you ?\nHow to Deal with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Mercury Retrograde period as they can feel sluggish , easily confused , or mentally foggy .\nMercury does rule over our mind and thinking processes , so with energy shifting to more of an internal state , it can sometimes be challenging to know which way to turn or how we should think about something .\nBut keep in mind , this is how we grow .\nThis is how the dimensions of our mind are changed and awakened .\nIf you are feeling foggy , scattered , or lethargic under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antidote is to draw your energy inward and give yourself time and space to reflect and look over the past .\nUsually , once Mercury ends its retrograde or aligns with the Sun , which happens once during each retrograde cycle , more clarity will arise .\nAs Mercury Retrograde aligns with the Sun , it is considered reborn and we are likely to gain clarity , new wisdom , and perhaps even some insights into what messages Mercury has been trying to deliver .\nFor this particular retrograde , Mercury aligns with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be an illuminating day , so look out for messages that come your way and pay attention to any signs the Universe sends .\nThe September Mercury Retrograde also happens to fall one day before the Pisces Full Moon .\nPisces energy can be likened to a piece of music .\nIt likes to flow in rhythm and in harmony .\nIt is formless , and yet , it moves us , inspires us , heals us , and can activate every emotion in our body .\nMusic can transform our cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As this music flows from the Pisces Full Moon , we may feel our energy wanting to flow too .\nAnd , with Mercury also scattering our mind and drawing us inward , we may find we feel a little all over the place , uncertain , or unconfident on how to proceed .\nIf this resonates , see if you can find your flow and surrender to it .\nDoing so will be so much easier than trying to fight it .\nIt is necessary every once in a while to flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to sit back in a more passive state .\nWhile we can \u2019 t always operate this way , the addition of Mercury Retrograde followed by the Pisces Full Moon just a day later is our permission slip from the Universe .\nAs Mercury moves through Libra from September 9-22 , it may highlight our relationships .\nOld relationships may come back into our lives in some way , or we may feel it necessary to leave some relationships in the past .\nWe may also feel confused or indecisive about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Mercury moves through Virgo from September 23 onwards , we may need to address the motivation behind our daily habits , particularly the habits that relate to our health and well-being .\nIs our motivation rooted in alignment or somewhere else ?\nMercury ends its retrograde on October 2 , but won \u2019 t be back to its former strength and energy until October

intention from the heart , and trust that you have been heard .\nThen , stay open to any signs , dreams , or intuitive pings that follow .\nThe more open and trusting you are , the more likely you are to receive .\nMars , the planet of action and energy is activated under this Full Moon too , which could trigger our more sensitive emotions , leaving us vulnerable or even moody .\nMars energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident-prone , and too quick to decide , so be mindful of falling into these patterns .\nThe energy around the Pisces Full Moon is really urging us to go slow and to take our time .\nIt is

2022-2023", "content": "Mars stations retrograde in Gemini from October 30 , 2022 , until January 12 , 2023 .\nMars will continue to move through Gemini , until March 26 , 2023 , spending an unusually long period of time in this corner of the zodiac .\nIt seems the Universe is setting us up to work with Mars in Gemini energies , let \u2019 s dive deeper into what this all means\u2026 Mars , the Planet of Energy and Motivation Mars is known as the planet of energy , motivation , and taking action .\nAncient astrologers depicted Mars as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would ride through the town on a chariot pulled by two horses named Phobos ( Fear ) and Deminia ( Terror ) .\nWhile Mars has the power to spread fear and terror wherever he went , he also had the power to overcome it too , and this is one of the ways we can work with the energy of Mars .\nMars can guide us to allow our fears to either ride us into a state of contraction or expansion .\nJust like Mars rides his horse-drawn chariot , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into limitations , blocks , and smallness , or we can ride our fears bravely and confidently to live the life of our dreams and highest purpose .\nIn modern astrology , Mars represents our fears , but also our energy levels , our ability to take action , our masculine side , our ego brain , our passions , and our sex drive .\nIt also rules over our heads , making us headstrong or hot-headed , and giving us natural leadership skills .\nMars takes about 2 years to work through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it retrogrades once .\nRetrogrades occur when a planet appears to be orbiting backward due to our vantage point here on Earth .\nWhen ancient astrologers observed this in the sky , it was believed to be a signal that it was time for us to go back over the past , reevaluate , and reassess , especially around areas relating to the planet \u2019 s energy .\nMars retrogrades the least out of all the planets , so as it happens so rarely this period of time heightens Mars energy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good time to : \u2022 Address how we are choosing to spend our energy \u2022 Assess the motivation behind our actions Mars Retrograde can also stir hotheaded emotions and challenge our leadership skills or any power struggles in our lives .\nAs Mars rules over the head , it can sometimes exacerbate physical symptoms in this area such as headaches .\nWhile there are many ways Mars Retrograde can manifest for us , the fact that Mars is retrograding and spending so much time in Gemini , is a clue as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gemini is the sign of the twins .\nOne twin is mortal , the other immortal , representing the balance between body and soul .\nWe are a soul , but we are also a body , here for a journey that should inspire both these sides of our being .\nGemini also rules over communication , our mental thought processes , and our ability to connect with others .\nIts ruling planet is Mercury , so there very well could be a \u201c Mercury-Retrograde flavor \u201d to this 2022-2023 Mars Retrograde energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will also station retrograde during this Mars Retrograde period from December 29 to January 18 , 2023 .\nThis is going to be a particularly sluggish time of very strong retrograde energy !\nBut it helps to remember that this is the Universe \u2019 s way of slowing us down , drawing us inward , and getting us to reevaluate .\nWith Mars Retrograde in Gemini , we may find there are issues with technology , delays around travel or contracts , or we may find it harder to think or communicate clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action and energy , it tends to slow things down , making it harder for us to take action and use our energy in the external world .\nAs Mars is traveling \u201c backward \u201d it is almost like we have to take a few steps back too and reassess before moving forward .\nWe may also find our motivation zapped or the need to address where our motivations are truly coming from and if they are aligned with where we want to be .\nJust like on a Mercury Retrograde , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or push forward on something new is likely to result in mishaps , missteps , and needing to eventually go back over things anyway .\nMars Retrograde in Gemini can also highlight the motivations behind how we are choosing to express ourselves and communicate with others .\nAre we doing things because we feel we should or because they come from a place of true alignment ?\nThe relationship with our ego may also come up for review under this energy .\nWe need our ego mind as it is the voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this physical world , but we may need to look deeper into any unhealthy habits or how our ego mind may be manipulating or misguiding us .\nAs Gemini can activate our inner voice , we may notice more people speaking up , or we may find that we need to speak up and state how we really feel .\nAlternatively , the reverse may be true , and we may find ourselves unable to really share how we feel .\nInstead , we may feel the urge to go within and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share with others .\nStrong Mars energy can make us hot-headed , triggering those fiery emotions so this may be something we need to be mindful of .\nIf you notice yourself feeling extra irritable , come back to your center , see what is hiding beneath it all , and listen to what your inner voice may be trying to communicate with you .\nCommunication with your inner world is going to be a strong antidote to whatever this Mars Retrograde in Gemini energy is stirring within your life !\nAnd finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before we leap , so be extra mindful to take your time , to pause , and avoid rushing ahead .\nMars Retrograde can also make us more accident-prone , and as it \u2019 s taking place in Gemini , we need to watch our hands and fingers , as they are the body parts Gemini rules !\nIf you want to dive deeper into the energies of Mars Retrograde and talk about what it means for your sign , join me for a special

to us , what we want to spend our energy doing , and where we desire to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off balance , or want to merge with the energies of Mother Earth , spending intentional time outdoors in connection with nature can be incredibly harmonizing and healing .\nThe September Equinox and the Start of Libra Season The September Equinox also brings the start of Libra Season , a sign of the zodiac that is strongly connected to finding our balance and the flow between giving and receiving in our lives .\nLibra also represents the self within the other , which is essentially the who that we become in the many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we like who we are when we are around certain people ?\nAre there certain relationships that bring out the best in us ?\nAre there certain relationships that challenge us to grow by triggering our traumas and subconscious behaviors ?\nAre there relationships that are just plain fun that remind us of the joy we have ?\nAre there relationships that feel one-sided or relationships that we have to maintain to stay professional or keep the peace ?\nRelationships are very often our greatest teachers .\nWe need them to thrive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we really are .\nIf you want to do some work around relationships , the Equinox and energies of Libra Season can be a beneficial time .\nHere is a journal exercise to get you started \u2013 Think about your closest , most profound , or most bothersome relationship , and then take a look at the following questions .\nThese questions can be tricky , so feel into them .\nGo with your intuition or just start writing and see what answers sprout .\nThese questions are not really designed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or spark different ideas or insights .\n\u2022 What do you think this relationship is trying to teach you ?\n\u2022 Do you feel this relationship has karmic ties or is written in your soul contract ?\nIf so , what do you think the higher purpose of it all is ?\n\u2022 Could you be projecting in this relationship or wanting things to be different than they are ?\n\u2022 Are you truly listening and communicating clearly in this relationship , or just assuming ?\n\u2022 Does something need to change in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can this change start with you ?\n\u2022 How can you show up as your best self in this relationship ?\n\u2022 What parts of you are stifled in this relationship ?\nWhat parts of you are encouraged to flourish ?\nUnder the September 2022 Equinox , we have six major planets in retrograde , which has been our calling card from the Universe to reflect , recharge , and reconsider how we are choosing to spend our energy .\nOn Equinox day , Mercury in retrograde happens to align with the Sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of zero degrees of Libra .\nHaving the Sun and Mercury together at this power point degree supercharges and infuses their energy together .\nThis can bring us greater illumination , a deeper clarity , and can help to surface all that has been hidden beneath the shadows .\nAs Buddha once said- \u201c Three things can not be long hidden : the Sun , the Moon , and the truth.\n\u201d And this feels like a very fitting quote for this cosmic merging .\nIf there is something in

Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus , Neptune , and Pluto .\nAs the we journey through the month however , Mercury , Pluto , and Saturn will all station direct , minimizing the flow of retrograde energy and kickstarting a new cycle of planetary energy .\nOctober also brings an incredibly healing , but perhaps also confronting Aries Full Moon , which will launch us deep into Eclipse Season .\nEclipse Season is always a highly transformative time .\nThe first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Moon Solar Eclipse , which takes place on October 25 .\nThe second Eclipse of the Season is a Blood Moon Eclipse in the sign of Taurus .\nWhile this Blood Moon Eclipse won \u2019 t manifest until November 8 , we will definitely be feeling it all through the month of October .\nEclipses represent jumps in our soul path and soul evolution .\nThey tend to bring stand out events or awakenings that can catapult our soul to the next chapter .\nWe have been working with this particular cycle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , we have had two more Eclipses in this series which fell in April and May of 2022 .\nUnder this October-November Eclipse cycle , we could very well see a common thread or theme emerging from these times .\nAnother major cosmic event this month is Mars Retrograde .\nMars is the planet of action , energy , and motivation .\nWhen it enters retrograde , we are challenged to think about how we are spending our energy and what drives our motivation .\nWe may also have to look back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be helping or harming us .\nMars Retrograde can definitely mess with our energy levels , but this is usually because we have some work to do , or something we need to address before we can move ahead .\nThings can feel extra sluggish when Mars is in Retrograde , and we may feel that every step forward brings a need to step back .\nYou can read more on Mars Retrograde here .\nLet \u2019 s take a look at the key astrological aspects of the month .\nThis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to include it as it \u2019 s a good one !\nJupiter is the planet of expansion and Venus is the planet connected to the heart , so here we have beautiful heart-expanding energy !\nThis is a great day to focus on self-love and self-compassion .\nMake some time to enjoy yourself and to enjoy life !\nIf you are feeling out of sorts , imagine breathing in this energy as a pink light .\nOn every inhale , feel the love that Venus can activate through this pink light .\nOn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removing all that is heavy or makes you feel unworthy .\nMercury stations direct after being retrograde since September 9 .\nMercury will take until October 15 to return to its former strength and speed , so give it a bit of time .\nMercury stationing direct can reveal hidden insights , new information , and intuitive messages .\nThings that felt cloudy can become clearer , and we can see things with a new clarity .\nWe may also find it easier to have difficult conversations and to negotiate contracts .\nPluto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it now stations direct bringing an end to its retrograde cycle .\nPluto is the planet of death and rebirth , so as it emerges from this chapter , we may be able to see with greater clarity all the ways we have transformed .\nIf we have experienced any endings , we may begin to see how those endings are guiding us in a new direction .\nThe Aries Full Moon carries some volatile energy that is likely to trigger a healing of sorts .\nWhile the results of this healing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there may be a little confronting or perhaps even aggravating .\nWe also may reach a point where we begin to release the idea of healing in favor of simply getting on with things .\nWe can sometimes reach a point where we become so obsessed with healing , that we lose sight of our journey and the feelings of calm we are trying to create .\nWe may also realize that we need to loosen our control or expectations of how we expect this healing to play out .\nThis Full Moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually , we have to let go and allow the healing to take place in its own time .\nThe Sun aligns with the super star Arcturus , allowing high-frequency energy to beam down to the planet .\nArcturus is a star associated with prosperity , abundance , and psychic energies .\nArcturus is also believed to be home to an advanced alien race that leads with love and compassion .\nYou can learn more about this magical gateway of energy here .\nAnother subtle , yet beautiful energy as Venus aligns with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Venus Star Point energy and shifts Venus from a morning star into an evening star .\nIt is said that when Venus is a morning star , the love it radiates shines outward , but when Venus becomes an evening star , the love it radiates shines within .\nThis shift helps to evoke feelings of self-love , self-compassion , and may direct our attention to what we need , rather than what those around us expect .\nThe Sun shifts out of air sign , Libra into water sign , Scorpio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy inward and make us curious about the root of our thought patterns and habits .\nWe may experience a breakthrough in understanding why we operate the way we do , or we may have an ah-ha moment that guides us to make changes in our lives .\nScorpio Season can make us extra sensitive , but the more in tune we become , the greater our awareness , the greater our perception , and the greater our understanding .\nSaturn stations direct after being retrograde since June 4th .\nThis represents a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a time where we may begin to see how our challenges have shaped us and opened us to new opportunities .\nSaturn is known as the Lord of Karma , and as it travels retrograde , it gives us an opportunity to clear and transcend any karmic debts .\nAs Saturn stations direct again , it often leaves a gift , celebrating all of our efforts and hard work !\nThis is one of the main features of the month and opens a portal to a new chapter in our lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2022 , needing to be revisited or similar themes presenting .\nEclipses tend to bring fated events into our lives that catapult us to the next level of evolution .\nThey challenge us to raise our consciousness and make clear-cut decisions about the direction of our lives .\nAs this is a Solar Eclipse , it may bring a new perspective on how we have been choosing to see things .\nSomething from our past may also be resolved or completed , creating space for something new to emerge .\nThis Eclipse will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moon Eclipse next month .\nJupiter first entered Pisces back in May 2021 , but moved into Aries earlier this year in May .\nThis is the first time Jupiter entered Aries in 12 years , creating a new wave of energy to work with .\nAs Jupiter has been traveling retrograde these last few months , it has worked its way back into Pisces once more to wrap up loose ends and tie up any unfinished business .\nWe may notice Jupiter in Pisces themes coming back around for clearing .\nYou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here .\nMars Retrograde begins on October 30 , but it \u2019 s likely we will already be feeling its effects before this day .\nMars is the planet that rules over our energy levels , our ability to take action , and our feelings of motivation .\nWith Mars entering retrograde , these areas of our lives may come into focus in some way .\nWe may find it more challenging to manage our energy levels , taking action may feel more challenging , or we may start questioning our motivation .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it is known to be a bit of a sluggish time .\nIt can also bring burnout or the need to

.\nThis is a time to set goals and plant intentions of what we wish to call into our world .\nWe are also called to focus on what is essential and vital , and let everything else fade into the

leadership and strength .\nThis is personified through the vibrant red and orange colors and confident and fiery energy .\nThe Emperor is a unique kind of leader .\nHe does not lead through fear ,

respect and loyalty .\nPeople follow him because it serves them well and adds positively to their lives .\nUnder the influence of the Emperor card , we ask ourselves : What qualities do I respect in others ?\nDo I have those qualities in myself ?\nHow can I show up like the leaders I admire ?\nThe Emperor steps forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us .\nHe comes to help us find our power and ignite the leader

transformation can feel somewhat disruptive or it could feel like a welcomed breath of fresh air .\nMany of us are afraid of change and anything new .\nWe are fearful because we crave permanence and

least for now ) , three years after my first Saturn Return was completed .\nIf you want to know the basics of what a Saturn Return is all about , I recommend reading Part 1 , but essentially , it is a 2.5-year period when you are forced to grow up in some way .\nIt \u2019 s a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , face up to your past , and put down some roots .\nMany astrologers feel that your first Saturn Return , which starts around 28 years of age , is your official welcome into adulthood and your first step up into real maturity .\nWe then have another Saturn Return at 58 and if we are lucky , 87 .\nThe first Saturn Return however , remains the most significant .\nNow that I have been through my first Saturn Return , I feel I can talk about it from a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nRight before my Saturn Return , I had just written my first professionally published book .\nIt had always been a dream of mine to write a book , and I poured so much of my heart , energy , and life into that book .\nTo this day , it is still the book I am most proud of .\nThe book was called , The Power of Positive Energy , and I feel it contained all the wisdom I had acquired on my spiritual journey up until that point in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contained a huge release , a huge birth of information from my heart , mind , and soul , out into the world .\nOnce the book was completed , I could feel an empty space and felt ready for the next chapter .\nI remember having this profound feeling wash over me that my next chapter was about to begin .\nI never dreamed that my next chapter would start with the death of my little sister .\nWe were extremely close .\nWe were best friends .\nWe shared everything .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book , The Power of Positive Energy , and yet , no positive energy was powerful enough to save me from this situation .\nBefore I continue , I want to point out that Saturn \u2019 s Return did not bring the death of my sister .\nPlanets do not have that kind of power .\nSaturn \u2019 s energy is not about dealing with death either , so no , someone you love is not necessarily going to die on your Saturn Return !\nAgain , planets are not responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThey are simply forces of energy that we can learn to decode in order to understand ourselves and our human experience a bit better .\nI don \u2019 t want to scare anyone reading this post !\nThis was my experience and my soul lesson to learn , and I know you have your own to go through too .\nNow that I look back , all the lessons that came from my sister \u2019 s passing ( which happened when I was 27 ) set me up for the lessons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming years .\nIt is my hope that sharing what I have learned after my first Saturn Return will be inspirational and encouraging as you move through or try to understand your own .\nHere are the biggest takeaways I feel my first Saturn Return inspired in me- My Saturn Return taught me that it doesn \u2019 t matter how much positivity you throw out into the world , how kind you are , how many rules you follow , or how long you spend meditating in 5D , nothing can spare you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are human , and part of that human experience sometimes involves dealing with tragedy , disease , painful situations , and death .\nWhile having a positive outlook and spiritual awareness can definitely bring ease to these situations , it can \u2019 t prevent them or save you from them .\nLife is hard sometimes .\nBad things happen to good people , of course , on a higher level , who are we to judge what is good and what is bad , but on a practical level , Saturn \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are immune from hardship and challenges , no matter how \u201c good \u201d we are .\n2 . )\nLife is not obligated to make sense to you We have a limited vantage point here on Earth .\nWe are all birds walking on the ground , perhaps when we die or ascend in consciousness , we are able to fly and see the whole view .\nBut until that point , we just have to accept that some things will never make sense to us through our limited rational minds .\nUp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew a little bit about life and how it all works , but after the death of my sister , I felt like I knew nothing !\nI feel Saturn took many of my beliefs and brought them back down to earth .\nI felt like it gave me a reality check and helped me to realize that there were no absolute truths .\n3 . )\nNo , you didn \u2019 t manifest that Our thoughts , emotions , and feelings are powerful , but you are not responsible for everything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that disease , that bad boyfriend , or that awful encounter with an abuser .\nNo amount of negative thinking means you deserve to experience any of these things .\nSometimes things just happen because this is the world we live in , this is our conditioning , this is our karmic destiny , or this is what our soul came to learn , or for who knows why !\nWe are co-creators of this Universe , working in synergy with others , with nature , and with God .\nSaturn teaches us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we are not .\nAnd , while we may not be responsible for causing everything that happens to us , we are responsible for how we choose to deal with it .\n4 . )\nEverything happens for a reason ?\nThis comment has become almost a controversial one .\nSome people have grown to resent it , and I can definitely see why .\nThere is no reason good enough in the entire Universe to justify some of the tragedies that life can bring .\nI do feel the energy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to confront that sometimes there is no good reason for things to happen .\nBut , on the flip side , I do think there is some truth to this statement .\nEverything does happen for a reason , but it is the reason that we choose to give to it .\nI feel the only way I have found to cope with my grief and loss is to put a purpose to it .\nTo take this nonsensical , horrible thing , and give it some reason for existing in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our hardships and turn them into something rewarding or even , our legacy .\nGrief is incredibly taxing to the body , so for the first time in my life , I was forced to set boundaries .\nI just couldn \u2019 t be around certain people , engage in certain conversations , or tolerate certain behaviors .\nI had to put my foot down and say no .\nNot everyone liked this , I lost friendships and severed connections with relatives , but I had to put myself first .\nI had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected to boundaries , it helps us to get firm with what we are willing to tolerate and where we need to draw the line .\nWhen Saturn \u2019 s energy is strong , like during a Saturn Return , we can very often feel the need to challenge our boundaries or withdraw in order to figure out where they need to start and end .\nMany traditional astrologers advise against getting married during your Saturn Return .\nThe belief is that the energy of your Saturn Return will forever be embedded into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling stifled , held back , or smothered .\nBut even knowing this , I decided to get married during my Saturn Return !\nI had been with my partner for five years , and the timing just felt right .\nAfter all the grieving , I wanted to celebrate love and all that was good in my life .\nI wanted to hold on to those who were nearest and dearest to me .\nI feel before the passing of my sister , I might have waited just to rule it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untimely death , I didn \u2019 t want to wait out of fear , I wanted to embrace all I was feeling and follow my heart .\nSaturn helped me to realize what was truly important to me and helped to affirm my commitment .\nHave you moved through your Saturn Return ?\nFeel free to share your biggest takeaways in the comments below !\nAnd I would love to hear from those who have had their second or even third Saturn Returns and how those may have felt different !", "author": "Tanaaz", "url": "https://foreverconscious.com/journeying-through-saturn-return-part-2", "published": "Thu, 06 Oct 2022

2022 , at 10am PDT .\nIn this workshop , we will talk about the Venus Star Point , plus do a guided heart-opening meditation .\nClick here to sign up .\nEvery eight years , Venus creates a perfect five-pointed star or five-petaled rose as it orbits around the Sun .\nKnown as the Rose of Venus or the Star of Venus , this perfect geometrical shape is a reminder of both the beauty and order that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create the petals , Venus shifts between being a morning star and an evening star .\nThis transition is marked by Venus aligning with the Sun , which is known as the Venus Star Point .\nAs Venus and the Sun come together , Venus transforms from a morning to an evening star .\nVenus then shifts retrograde and will align with the Sun once more to become a morning star .\nThe cycle then repeats .\nSince the start of 2022 , Venus has been traveling as a morning star .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she will align with the Sun , and slowly transform into an evening star .\nThis transformation can take up to 80 days as Venus merges its energy with the center of our solar system .\nAt the end of this merging , Venus will slowly separate from the Sun and appear in the evening sky .\nEvening sky Venus is said to help us activate feelings of self-love , self-nourishment , and to bring beauty to our inner world .\nMorning Sky Venus is said to help us create partnership , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty to our external world .\nWe typically experience one Venus Star Point each year , but the October Star Point will actually be our second .\nThe first we experienced was on January 8 , 2022 .\nWhat also adds to the significance of the October Venus Star Point is that it will take place in Libra , its ruling sign .\nVenus has not created a star point in Libra since the 1770s , making this the first time that any of us have experienced this energy .\nTo add to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conjunct the dwarf planet , Haumea , which is named after the Hawaiian Goddess of Birth .\nPlus , Saturn stations direct on this day , and we are deep in Eclipse Season too !\nThis creates a lot of intense and transformational energy to work with , especially when it comes to our relationships , matters of the heart , and the expression of the feminine .\nLet \u2019 s break down what it all means and how you can maximize its energy in your own life \u2013 As Venus orbits around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five-petalled flower known as the Rose of Venus .\nEach one of these petals represents a growth point or an evolution point when it comes to love , connection , our values , and our interpretation of beauty .\nThe Rose of Venus takes 8 years to be completed , and we can track how the formation of each petal has marked a period of maturity and ascension in our relationships and in matters relating to the heart .\nThe current Rose of Venus we are working on began in June 2020 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Star Points and will help you to track the evolution of Venus energy in your own life : PETAL 1 : A New Venus Cycle Begins .\nWe are preparing to undergo a new cycle when it comes to matters of the heart , relationships , and how we perceive beauty .\nPETAL 2 : We are moving deeper into the lessons of this Venus cycle .\nWe may begin intuiting or beginning to understand more of the journey .\nPETAL 3 : Our consciousness is rising as we are more than halfway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the peak of our story .\nPETAL 4 : Things are unraveling , and we are able to see the core lessons unfold .\nExpansion begins to occur , and a new way of working with Venus energy emerges .\nPETAL 5 : We have reached a new state of consciousness .\nWe are able to harvest the rewards and work that our journey has brought our way .\nEndings may also be a theme .\nYou can track the Rose of Venus in your own life to see what themes or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time , and what chapter you are working through in your own life .\nThe Venus Star Point and Haumea , the Merging of Two Goddesses On October 22 , 2022 , as Venus aligns with the Sun at 29 degrees of Libra , Haumea , the Hawaiian Goddess of Birth is also resting at this degree .\nThe alignment of the two Goddesses , Venus and Haumea symbolizes a powerful fusion of feminine energy .\nThis is further enhanced by the fact that Venus will be aligning in her ruling sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the zodiac is also considered a particularly karmic degree and can enhance the planetary energies .\nHaumea has the gift of being able to birth children from the limbs of her own body .\nShe represents Divine creation and the incredible and perhaps untapped power that a child-bearing body holds .\nWe can use her energy to create , not with forced effort , but with trust .\nHaumea knows how to harness the power of nature and her innate abilities to create and to bring new life to things .\nShe doesn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply follows the same order and structure that nature provides .\nWe can use the energy of Haumea to bring trust and ease to whatever we are moving through .\nWe can use her wisdom to remind ourselves that all things bloom in their own time .\nWe can also use her energy to remind ourselves that we are powerful and capable to create and to birth new life into all areas of our lives .\nIt is also interesting to note that the dwarf planet of Haumea is shaped like an egg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many cultures , the egg is known as a symbol for fertility , new life , and new beginnings .\nIf there is something in your life that needs a rebirth , if you are looking to bring fresh energy or new creations into your life , you can connect with Haumea for guidance .\nWith Venus and Haumea coming together , we can notice themes relating to fertility and childbirth , the rebirth of heart matters , a deepening in our relationships , particularly with women , an activation of Divine feminine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create nourishment and comfort .\nWith the Venus Star Point also happening so close to the October 25 , Solar New Moon Eclipse in Scorpio we may also notice changes and transformations when it comes to our relationships and how we choose to show up in them .\nWe may find a need to deepen our connection with others or with ourselves , so we can understand , empathize , and find deeper compassion .\nWant to dive deeper into the Venus Star Point energies ?\nJoin me for a Zoom Workshop on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PDT .\nIn this workshop , we will talk

the Sun makes its annual alignment with one of the brightest stars in the night sky , Arcturus .\nAs our Sun comes into alignment with Arcturus , we are able to merge with its energy and receive its incredible frequencies on Earth .\nWe should feel this Gateway of Arcturian energy with us from October 16th through to the 18th .\nI have some channeled insights to share with you on this Arcturus Gateway .\nBut first , a little about Arcturus : Arcturus is about 25 times bigger than our Sun and is located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see it shining brightly from both hemispheres , and it has a distinct orange-red hue .\nAs a bright shining star , Acturus captured the attention of our ancient ancestors .\nMany myths and legends were shared about Arcturus , and it was used as a guiding star for those making the long journey across the seas .\nIn western astrology , Arcturus is believed to be a lucky star that carries the energy of prosperity and determination .\nIt indicates that if we work hard and are fair and honest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rewarded .\nIn Vedic astrology , Arcturus is known as Swati , which means \u201c very beneficient.\n\u201d Edgar Cayce , the famous psychic and prophet has also channeled information from Arcturus , saying it was home to a highly advanced alien race .\nOther psychics and mystics have also channeled information from this star .\nThere are also Arcturian starseeds on Earth , which are those that descended from Arcturus and feel a strong connection to the star .\nWhile I am not an Arcturian Starseed , I have been told that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFrom all the galactic beings I have been in contact with , I feel the closest connections to the Acrturians .\nI have channeled some messages that I share with you here : As the Sun aligns with Arcturus , we are able to receive its light codes directly to the planet and straight into our bodies .\nThese light codes will enter as a column of bright blue light that descends from the heavens straight down into the top of our heads .\nFrom October 16th-October 18th , visualize this blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your body .\nFeel this bright blue light , lifting your mood , opening your own energy gates , connecting you to the abundance all around , and inviting more joy into every cell of your body .\nArcturians are light-hearted beings .\nThey remind us to not take life so seriously and to remember that this is all part of a much bigger \u201c game.\n\u201d While life feels so real and so serious to us while we are living it , things are not really what they seem .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we miss so much .\nWe are only ever seeing part of the details , so we must not get too attached to what we are seeing , hearing , and feeling .\nArcturians are incredibly gentle and loving beings , they do not know hate the way humans do .\nAs our Sun aligns with Arcturian energy , we can all be reminded that our ability to love is so much greater than our ability to hate .\nHating is easy , but loving is where we find our true courage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love each other , and love those that have wronged us will lead us to a new power .\nEven though it seems hard or challenging to show and find love for those that we deem bad or dangerous or even evil , if we open our hearts to recognize that the same love that made them have made us , then we start to heal ourselves and the planet .\nJust remember the next time you are upset with someone or mad about something- remember that it is easy to be upset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more liberated to ask- how can I love instead ?\nYou must also learn to forgive yourself because remember , nothing is as it seems .\nThe \u201c wrongdoings \u201d that you make in this life could actually be part of something you are not aware of .\nEver feel that you have been unfairly treated ?\nIt seems that way at the time but everything makes sense in the end .\nWhen you step out of your human body , you will see how everything is connected and everything has its place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated has its place !\nThe Universe is not random , there is a structure and order , just like every cell of your body has structure and order .\nIt is just that when you are in a human body , this structure and order appears somewhat chaotic to you .\nThis is how it should be , for if you learned the order , the game would be up !\nAnd you are here to play a game of sorts .\nEven though you may be thinking \u2013 I want out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be here .\nAs hard as that sounds , this game is not just a game for entertainment , it \u2019 s a game for something much more .\nWe can not share all of the information with you here on this \u201c game \u201d , but if you ask your own heart and soul you may just receive a memory or a ping , reminding you that nothing is as it seems .\nYou may even be able to journey yourself back through the hall of records and see yourself before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how your avatar was going to \u201c play the game \u201d .\nThis Universe is so big and grand and there are so many forces we are feeling at different times .\nYou work on the planets in your solar system ( astrology ) , but really , you are connected and part of all of it .\nYou can not just take the focus of one planet or one star and say- there , that \u2019 s it .\nThe Universe is not so easy to decode , try as you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Universe and stars like us are a good place to look , an even better place to look is inside of you .\nRather than look to the movements of the planets , look to the movements of yourself .\nLook to the subtle changes and reflections that are taking place in your own inner Universe .\nBut we understand , sometimes it is easy and even necessary to look outside of yourself rather than within .\nThat is why you have eyes to see and lips to tell and feelings to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so simple all at the same time .\nBut know that we always come in love .\nYou can ask to connect and talk to us at any time , and if you feel love then you know it is us .\nYour planet is about to go through a huge metamorphosis and shift in the coming months .\nYou should see how excited \u2014 and a little bit concerned , we all are across the Galaxy .\nThink of yourself as part of Earth \u2019 s energy .\nThe entire planet is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new levels , which means so too are you .\nBig things are in the works for Earth , but don \u2019 t worry so much about it all .\nYou should be used to all this by now !\nKnow that even though things seem like the end they are never the end .\nRemember that nothing is really as it seems so don \u2019 t get so attached to outcomes and the things that find you .\nLearn to laugh it off a little for it \u2019 s never as real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that life has a plan for you but actually it is the other way around .\nYou are a plan for life .\nYou get to decide what life is and how it needs to be \u201c lived.\n\u201d Over the years humans have tried to create some order and structure for comfort and security , but there are better ways coming .\nIf you are struggling , know you are not alone .\nAnd if you are not struggling , know it is your job to help those who are .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be helped .\nDon \u2019 t take things for granted and know that all of this is temporary .\nYou may be struggling today , but some day you won \u2019 t be .\nYou may be fine today , but struggling tomorrow .\nSo don \u2019 t judge .\nAnd do go out of your way to help each other .\nYou will see that this \u201c game \u201d you are playing is not really about how much material items you can possess \u2013 that is not how you collect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from other things .\nThe points have nothing to do with success and everything to do with how you show up when you are called .", "author": "Tanaaz", "url":

.\nOur framing and judgment determine how we carry our experiences and how we let them impact us .\nWe are in control of the story we tell ourselves ; taking that control can change everything .\nThere is so much wisdom with our first card , the Prince of Disks , but there is also a lot of heaviness .\nThis card speaks to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the obstacles of our past that continue to impact us .\nWe are not light and breezy when it comes to making decisions or taking steps forward .\nWe have experienced deep pain and loss and it informs our behavior .\nThe Prince of Disks sits on a cumbersome chariot pulled by a large but determined bull .\nAt his back are boulders of different sizes that push into his skin .\nThe boulders represent our past and the pain we have experienced .\nWe can not let go of the hard times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we carry them along our path .\nWe could feel depressed by the number of struggles we have gone through and our inability to fully let them go , or we could embrace it as something that makes us wiser , stronger , and more compassionate .\nI think this card can speak both to our personal and collective pains .\nWe feel heavier because of everything we have been through .\nBut we are also more aware and hopefully more loving .\nWe have grown in our empathy and our perceptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see things we couldn \u2019 t before .\nWe know how to support people in ways that match what they truly need .\nWe also can see through deceptive and corrupt actions .\nTraditionally , the Prince of Disks is slower moving and takes their time to make decisions .\nThey do this in order to think deeply about what is their next step .\nThe pains of their past have given them wisdom and insights .\nThey use this knowledge to think through all the scenarios and what could go wrong .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to be smarter in the choices we make .\nWe do not fall for the same mistakes and we put our relationship with ourselves first .\nHowever , we can also fall into a pattern of not making decisions or overthinking everything .\nOur past can make us overly critical and we can feel like inaction is the best choice .\nSo , be on the lookout for any stalling behavior .\nWe must still make decisions , even if we take more time to do so .\nOur second card this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referred to as Disappointment .\nThis card comes up in times of emotional sensitivity .\nWe see five empty cups , representing feelings of depletion .\nDecaying water lilies and their knotted roots symbolize our inner troubles below the surface .\nOur disappointment can come in many forms .\nDisappointment with ourselves , others , or the world itself .\nMaybe we had high expectations and things did not turn out the way we wanted .\nMaybe we feel overwhelmed by the all suffering in the world .\nThe Five of Cups asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is telling you it is okay to feel disappointed , it is part of the human experience .\nLet yourself cry , write down your thoughts , and really grieve .\nBut if you look closer at the roots at the bottom of the card you will see something else , a butterfly .\nThe message here is that pain can be our catalyst for change and the fuel for our metamorphosis .\nWhen a caterpillar becomes a butterfly it literally digests parts of itself .\nCell groups then turn the liquid material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , wings , and other structures of the butterfly .\nIt is truly amazing .\nThe Five of Cups is calling us to digest our pain and turn ourselves into something new .\nWe can be our own version of a butterfly that

"content": "Scorpio Season begins on October 23 , 2022 , and is marked by the Sun moving out of the tropical zodiac of Libra and into the zodiac of Scorpio .\nScorpio is a sign connected to transformation and the cycles of death and rebirth .\nAt this time of year , nature is a constant reminder of the cycles of death and rebirth as we reach the fullness of Spring or Autumn .\nEven in our own lives , we may begin reflecting on the cycles of transformation , especially as we enter Eclipse Season .\nThe last Eclipse Season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in April and May , so our mind may wander to events from this timeframe .\nWe may begin to see how our lives are transforming or we may feel a greater clarity on our journey between death and rebirth .\nTransformation can often be painful and involves the stripping of layers .\nBut as each layer is pulled back , we can gain a deeper awareness and move closer to the core of who we are .\nScorpio energy is always beneficial when it comes to understanding the roots behind our actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps us to uncover blockages , heal our inner child , and become more aware of our motivations .\nWith Mars entering Retrograde on October 30 , we may feel our energy shifting inward , helping us to reflect and reassess how our actions and motivations are either serving or hindering us .\nBetween Mars Retrograde and the Eclipses , it \u2019 s likely we will all be peeling back some layers this Scorpio Season .\nRead for your Sun , Moon , or Rising Scorpio Season is a busy one and brings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the planet of expansion has been working its way retrograde through your sign .\nAncient astrologers believed that when Jupiter was in your sign , you carried an extra wave of good luck !\nHopefully , you have been feeling this good luck , but if not , once Jupiter stations direct come December and really gets moving into Aries next year , you will hopefully be able to reap some of these lucky benefits !\nThis beautiful , positive energy is on the way , so don \u2019 t be discouraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funky lately .\nYour ruling planet , Mars is preparing to go retrograde under the Scorpio Sun on October 30 .\nMars Retrograde is connected to sluggishness , a lack of motivation , burnout , and the inability to make a decision .\nSome people describe Mars Retrograde as taking one step forward and two steps back .\nMars Retrograde definitely does not favor being in a rush or taking strong action .\nIt wants us to pause , reflect , and assess where our motivation is coming from and what is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take .\nWe may find our motivations up for review , and with that review can come some painful realizations .\nTo add more intensity to the season , we also have two Eclipses to move through .\nThe first Eclipse is a gentle one and falls on October 25 in the sign of Scorpio .\nThis Eclipse will open a pathway of understanding , helping you to reach a new level of clarity .\nYou may find the answers you have been seeking come easily and fall into place with ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a bit more intense and is a Blood Moon Eclipse in the sign of Taurus .\nIt peaks on November 8 .\nThis Eclipse may get you thinking about your finances or perhaps even your self-worth .\nIf money troubles have been an issue , remember you have the luck of Jupiter in your corner !\nThings can turn around quickly , so keep the faith and know the Universe is helping you to release blockages , barriers , and beliefs that may prevent you from obtaining the abundance you deserve .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ in April or May of this year , you may find this Eclipse brings some new developments or perhaps even some changes .\nKeep your boundaries and don \u2019 t forget to speak up if you are not a fan of the changes that are being suggested .\nBlood Moon Eclipses can also bring endings , so this may also be a theme , but remember that Eclipses always bring us where we need to be for the highest evolution of our soul growth .\nWhatever challenges come your way , know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brighter chapter .\nScorpio sits opposite you on the wheel of the zodiac , so Scorpio Season is always going to be a special one for you .\nThings may have felt intense this year as you have worked through Eclipses and the energy of Uranus in your sign .\nYou have definitely been a celestial favorite and have received a lot of cosmic energies this year !\nYou may have felt this manifesting in your own life and perhaps seen a lot of changes , transitions , or upheaval .\nMaybe as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you are beginning to reflect on where you wish to be or what is truly important to you moving forward .\nYour ruling planet of Venus will be next to the Sun at the start of Scorpio Season , helping to activate your heart and get you thinking about what truly matters .\nYou may have to sit down and think about your values and how you can be of better service to them .\nVenus being nice and close to the Sun is also a great time to schedule a pamper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If relationship troubles have been on your mind , know you can also tap into this Venus energy for heart expansion and to feel greater compassion .\nMoving forward into Scorpio Season , we have a New Moon Solar Eclipse on October 25 .\nSpeaking of relationship issues , this Eclipse may highlight a particular relationship in your life , helping you to know if you are walking the right path or if changes need to be made .\nYou may find that your heart can open deeper and wider , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love .\nAlternatively , this greater love may come for yourself and be the fuel that is needed to cut ties if that is the direction you choose to go .\nThe Blood Moon Eclipse then follows on November 8 and falls directly in your sign .\nThis is some very intense energy , so be very gentle with yourself .\nBlood Moon Eclipses can stir endings and can bring startling or even surprising news .\nAs the Eclipse falls in your sign , it will be essential to watch your health and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are generally very in tune with your body , so don \u2019 t let anything slide .\nWith Mars also being retrograde at this time , it will also be doubly important not to rush so you can avoid careless accidents .\nBy the end of the Season , after the Eclipse dust has settled , you may feel elevated and improved .\nWhenever Eclipses fall in your sign , it \u2019 s a gift from the Universe that your life is getting a nice upgrade and you are shifting to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even though there are a few more Eclipses in this series to go

comfortable with .\nAs Mars travels retrograde , you may feel yourself moving inward a bit more .\nYou may not find it as easy to be your usual chatty self , or you may feel like you need to retreat and just take time to decompress .\nMars Retrograde is a powerful time for getting still and thinking about what drives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we are doing ?\nAre we just running on autopilot , repeating

to focus on your well-being may also be a theme under this New Moon Eclipse .\nThe second Eclipse in this series , and the final for 2022 , is a Blood Moon Eclipse on November 8 , and there is some strong intensity attached to this Eclipse .\nThis Blood Moon Eclipse may expose a secret or stir information from the past that you may not have realized .\nSome information may come to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end to something or to adjust your approach in some way .\nThese Eclipses are connected to the ones we had back in April-May of this year , so issues from this time may also come back up to the

brings Eclipses and Mars Retrograde , both of which can bring a few challenges .\nStarting in order , we have an Eclipse on October 25th .\nThis is a Solar New Moon Eclipse that falls in the sign of

lose ends or bring an end to something .\nSolar Eclipses tend to bring new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapter , but before we can really understand what the new is , we must first wrap up and complete the old .\nThere seems to be the theme of heart expansion under this Solar Eclipse for you , so whatever transpires , it \u2019 s likely you are going to move into a deeper and more compassionate heart space .\nFollowing this Eclipse on October 30 , we have Mars stationing retrograde .\nMars Retrograde is a time to reassess our motivations and actions .\nIts a time to think about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear might be getting in the way .\nHidden fears may come up to the surface under this Mars Retrograde , forcing you to confront them .\nFear is one of those tricky emotions .\nWe need fear as it protects us , and very often , no matter how hard we try , we can \u2019 t really escape from feeling fear about certain things .\nSometimes the best and most successful way to deal with fear is to feel it but to move forward anyway .\nMars is the planet associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this beautiful image of Mars , the God of War , riding a chariot with two horses , one named Phobos ( fear ) and the other named Deimos ( panic/terror ) .\nMars has two choices , he can either let his fear ride him and direct which way the chariot will go or he can ride with his fears as a fuel to fulfil his dreams and get where he wants to go .\nWe each have a choice , and this is what Mars Retrograde can stir for us during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event of Scorpio Season is the Blood Moon Eclipse which peaks on November 8 in the sign of Taurus .\nThis Blood Moon does carry some very strong intensity , and may bring an ending or completion point in your life .\nEclipses can be intense , and being so Moon sensitive you are

@ more awakened , and more connected to your heart .\nScorpio Season brings two Eclipses and Mars Retrograde , and while these cosmic events all carry certain levels of intensity , I want you to focus

ambitions , and energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to take action and make decisions .\nWe may find all of these areas up for review in our lives in some way .\nWe may need to assess what drives our motivations and where our ambition is genuinely rooted .\nAre we acting from a place of fear or expansion ?\nAre our actions rooted in our ego or our heart ?\nYou are a very heart led sign , so this is an excellent opportunity to align more of your actions and motivations with your heart rather than your ego @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy levels , it will be essential to take things slowly and not rush ahead .\nThe saying- haste makes waste , is doubly true under a Mars Retrograde .\nThe two Eclipses we have during Scorpio Season bring waves of transformative energy .\nThe first Eclipse , a Solar

that promise to blossom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time comes .\nThis Solar Eclipse may also highlight your home and family environment and bring about a move or some sort of changes within the home .\nEclipses tend to come in pairs , so the next Eclipse in this series is a Blood Moon Eclipse which peaks on November 8 .\nThis Eclipse carries some strong waves of intensity but may bring an exciting

Taurus , this Blood Moon Eclipse peaks early in the month on November 8 and colors the remaining weeks ahead .\nEclipses are highly transformative portals of energy .\nThey tend to bring endings , shifts , and quantum leaps into new states of being .\nThey can reveal things , expose the truth , and change the direction we have been traveling in .\nAt their core , Eclipses bring fated or karmic events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next chapter of our soul evolution .\nA Blood Moon Eclipse is the most potent kind we can experience , so it \u2019 s safe to say we will all be doing some soul-leveling up in November !\nAs we journey through November , we will also be working with the energies of Mars Retrograde .\nMars Retrograde can sometimes make us feel sluggish or can heighten feelings of burnout if we have been doing too much or pushing too hard .\nMars retrogrades the least out of all the planets , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its retrograde motion .\nYou can read more about Mars Retrograde , plus join me

be familiar with the Southern Cross .\nThis small constellation is featured on the Australian and New Zealand flag and is an important identifier in the southern skies .\nOn this day , our Sun aligns with the brightest star in the Southern Cross , Acrux .\nAcrux is the base of the cross and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessings , and honor .\nChannel the energy of this day by focusing on the many blessings around you !\nThis is the headline event for the month !\nA Blood Moon Eclipse occurs when we have a Total Full Moon Eclipse .\nThe totality of the Eclipse causes the Moon to take on a reddish hue , hence the name Blood Moon .\nBlood Moon Eclipses signify endings and can close a door somewhere in our lives .\nThis closed door may be hard to navigate at first , but eventually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a higher path , even if it doesn \u2019 t seem that way at first .\nFalling in the sign of Taurus , this Blood Moon Eclipse may stir themes relating to money and relationships \u2013 the two may even be intertwined !\nOn a deeper level , this Eclipse may also help us to push past some blockages around feelings of worthiness , or issues around our worthiness may come up to be challenged or addressed .\nIf you are dealing with a challenging situation around this Eclipse , see if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unworthy may be blocking you or creating the issue .\nSee if you can claim your worth , get clear on what worthiness or being worthy means to you , and then proceed from that place .\nRight under the Blood Moon Eclipse , Mercury will align with the Sun .\nThis event is known as Mercury Cazimi and indicates a new cycle of awareness , mental growth , and deeper awareness .\nAs Mercury aligns with the Sun , we can gain new clarity and begin to see things from a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloudy or confusing can become clearer .\nThis can be heightened by the Eclipse energy which can also illuminate and unlock a higher truth .\nBe sure you are speaking and communicating your truth under this energy , as any lies or deceits can be more easily exposed .\nA day after the potent Blood Moon , the Sun moves to be opposite Uranus , the planet of awakening and surprise .\nThis could cause the Eclipse to bring some surprising news or some information that helps to awaken and shift our consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface , we will probably find that we need to make a clear-cut change .\nWhenever Uranus \u2019 energy is strong , we can feel a little unsettled or unstable , so if this resonates , come back to grounding exercises or spend time in nature .\nA magical day of alignment and wishes !\n1111 is a powerful angel number that indicates alignment and being in Divine harmony .\nWhen we are in this state , we can feel balanced in our mind , body , and soul .\nThis balance can

.\nWhile Venus traveled through Scorpio , she was helping us to dig deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yearn for in our lives .\nWe may now have a deeper understanding of how love shows up for us , and how we need love to show up for us .\nVenus will now enter Sagittarius , which is a much lighter zodiac for the planet of Love .\nIn Sagittarius , Venus will be helping us to return to a state of lightness and joy .\nVenus in Sagittarius helps us to focus on our friendship connections and create a more balanced social life .\nMars is traveling retrograde until January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy that is going to keep coming up for us as we move through the rest of the year .\nOn this day , Retrograde Mars is in a Square or 90-degree angle with the planet Neptune .\nThis can create some stagnant energy that

heads .\nTrust your intuition at this time , especially if you have to make a decision .\nThe Sun moves into the fire sign of Sagittarius , which is represented by the arrow of the archer .\nThe arrow moves with intention , making its way to the target .\nWhile the arrow will eventually land where it \u2019 s supposed to , it \u2019 s really about the journey , and that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWe may

that the same events will necessarily repeat themselves , but you may notice you are working through a similar set of lessons .\nThese lessons are likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path and karmic destiny .\nIn a way , you can think of Eclipses as accelerators that push us further along on our soul journey .\nFor this reason , Eclipses tend to trigger fated or transformative events .\nTransformation can always be challenging and often requires the painful work of peeling back layers , shedding skin , and birthing into the new .\nEach of these steps carries its struggles and magic , but under a Blood Moon Eclipse , the intensity level can be turned up .\nA Blood Moon Eclipse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience as it \u2019 s a Total Eclipse .\nIt gets the name Blood Moon , as the otherwise luminous Full Moon turns a bloodish red color as it is completely eclipsed by the shadow of the Earth .\nThis eclipsing of the Full Moon causes darkness , something that can influence our energy field , our pineal gland

Blood Moon , we can feel zapped , off-balance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt is important to practice self-care , grounding exercises , and to get plenty of rest .\nBlood Moon Eclipses can also have a purging

active under this November Eclipse .\nWe may feel inspired to cut the chains that have kept us bound and free ourselves from any boxes we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longing for greater freedom ?\nWhat chains do you need to cut ?\nWhat do you need to break free from ?\nYou may very well find the Blood Moon Eclipse energy lending a supporting hand .\nUranus can also bring awakening and surprise , so there

questioning may open up for you under this Eclipse .\nGet real with yourself .\nDon \u2019 t be afraid to get honest and have a real conversation about what you truly value and where your beliefs lie around those values .\nThe November Blood Moon Eclipse is also a wonderful time to set intentions around releasing self-limiting beliefs that keep you small .\nWeed out any beliefs that are making you feel that you are not good enough or worthy enough and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release .\nYou may also find that things that you no longer value , or things that you have pretended to value , may fall away from

feeling extra overwhelmed , irritable , or frustrated , especially if we are holding on to past events or past stories .\nIf you are feeling consumed by any of this , consider writing a letter where you get out everything from the past that is troubling you .\nWrite it all down , reflect on any wisdom that comes up , and then burn it as a signal of release .\nThen , when you feel ready , write a

Moon December 2022", "content": "We have made it to the last Full Moon of 2022 .\nFalling in the sign of the Gemini twins on December 7-8 , this Full Moon carries some heated , charged energy .\nWhile it is not as intense as the Blood Moon Eclipse we had back in November , it may act as a trigger , reigniting or reawakening tender spots that were stirred at that time .\nGemini is represented by the twins , where one twin is mortal and the other immortal .\nThe twins represent both sides of our being .\nWe are both human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us that will die and part of us that will live forever .\nThis unity of our human selves and spiritual selves is what the Gemini Full Moon calls us to balance .\nUnder the Full Moon , we may find ourselves needing to honor and be patient with our human side .\nWe are only human .\nIt is ok that we have feelings , that we make mistakes , and that we don \u2019 t always know the way .\nJust the same , we are going to have to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side too .\nOur spirit side knows there are no wrong turns , no regrets , and no mistakes .\nOur spirit side knows that everything is a learning journey and that love is all there really is .\nBoth our human and spirit sides don \u2019 t always work in tandem , and it can be challenging for them to understand each other \u2019 s perspectives .\nOur human selves need necessities like food and shelter .\nOur soul selves need to follow what brings joy .\nOur human selves want stability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all is temporary and that we are already healed .\nFinding balance between these two knowings can sometimes be tricky , but this Full Moon is our opportunity .\nNo matter what is coming up for you under this Full Moon , see if you can honor your human and soul side .\nSee if you can connect with each of these parts of yourself like you were connecting with an old friend .\nListen to what they have to say , treat them with respect , and balance will naturally follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heated and charged energy around this Full Moon , mostly thanks to the presence of Mars , which is conjunct the Moon .\nMars is also currently traveling retrograde , which amplifies its energy .\nMars is the planet of motivation , action , and energy .\nWhile in retrograde , we can feel challenged to question our motivations and actions and to reconsider what we are choosing to spend our energy on .\nOur energy is a precious resource , so this Full Moon may also highlight what is worth spending our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released .\nIf you are wasting your energy on certain thought patterns , relationships , behaviors , and beliefs , this Full Moon is a good time to state them out loud and release them to the wind .\nMars \u2019 presence may also have us feeling heated or charged up about something .\nIt may be hard to keep our emotions in balance , but sometimes it is perfectly acceptable to be angry , to assert yourself , and to allow heated emotions to be released .\nSometimes we need to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and while there are conscious ways we can go about it , sometimes life circumstances can get the better of us .\nThis is ok .\nThis is what makes us human .\nWe don \u2019 t have to be love and light all the time .\nIt is , in fact , more natural for us to embrace how we truly feel , even if we suspect that it is coming from a place of ego .\nSometimes we have to give ourselves permission to just be human .\nMany of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our anger .\nNo one wants to feel angry , no one wants to be on the receiving end of it either , and while anger can be toxic at times , it is also a healthy and valid human emotion .\nSometimes our anger just needs an escape for us to be free of it .\nThen , we can find it easier to regroup and understand where to go next .\nThe fiery and heated energy around this Full Moon could make us say something we regret or fuel up our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later feel a little ashamed about .\nBut , be gentle with yourself .\nDon \u2019 t be too proud to apologize if you need to , but don \u2019 t walk back what you expressed if it is really how you feel .\nHave the courage to honor your boundaries , who you are , and what you stand for .\nThe more we express our anger and heated emotions , the better we get at doing so in a conscious and healthy way .\nIt takes practice , so we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planet active in the sky during this Full Moon .\nNeptune is the planet of intuition , so we may find ourselves receiving confirmation for something we have had an intuitive inkling about for some time .\nTrust your instincts under this Full Moon , and if you need , the Universe will send signs of confirmation your way .\nOverall , the astrology of the December 2022 Full Moon shows us that is ok for us to feel , to experience , and to test the boundaries we have built for ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep adapting , and keep challenging ourselves to continue our mission .\nOur human mission is to stay alive and healthy for as long as possible and to feel secure and stable .\nOur soul mission is to experience all the emotions of the rainbow : to love , to lose , to adapt , to grow , and to transform .\nLife is a juggle between the two , but

to tap into the place that fills us up and makes us feel purposeful and passionate .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should direct our energy .\nThe Two of Wands is all about using the places in our life where we feel the strongest and most confident to give us information about our purpose .\nWe can also use these places to give us more strength and confidence in other areas where we feel less so .\nThe idea is if we know we can be courageous in some areas of our life , why can \u2019 t we harness that courage in other areas ?\nWe are funny , creative , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this energy into places where we

2023", "content": "Capricorn Season begins on December 21st , the same day as the Solstice .\nWhenever Capricorn Season comes around , I love to tell the story of the Sea Goat .\nCapricorn is ruled by the Sea Goat , a mythical creature that is half fish , half goat .\nThere is a lot of rich symbolism we can learn from the Sea Goat .\nIt can scale the highest mountains but also swim to the depths of the sea .\nThe Sea Goat can see things from many vantage points and perspectives .\nSomething other animals can not do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also at a disadvantage .\nIt has to work harder than the fish with tails and fins .\nIt has to work harder than the other goats with all four legs .\nBut through its hard work , it can see both the seas and the skies .\nThere is something we can all take away from the story of the Sea Goat , but for Capricorn Season 2022-2023 , it feels like this mysterious creature is preparing us for what \u2019 s ahead .\nCapricorn Season welcomes us into the new year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 2023 is innovation and independence .\nWe are learning not to lose ourselves in others .\nWe are learning that we can be resourceful and use all of our skills to get where we want to be .\nJust like the Sea Goat that learns to use its legs for walking and its tail for swimming , we too can tap into all of our natural skills and talents to reach further and aim higher .\n2023 will be supporting us on this journey , and the Sea Goat is our perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nLet \u2019 s take a deeper look at what \u2019 s ahead for your sign .\nYou can read for both your Sun and Rising sign-

@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reminds us that even though we may be wounded , we can still access our magical , innate gifts and talents .\nAs we wrap up 2022 , Mercury will station retrograde on December 29 , joining Mars .\nMercury will remain in retrograde until January 18 .\nWith both of these planets in retrograde together , we may feel the transition between 2022 and 2023 a little foggy , confusing , or stagnant .\nWhile many use this transition point to set goals and make to-do lists , it may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mercury in retrograde together seem to be guiding us to go within and reflect , rather than to rush ahead and begin new things .\nThese planets in retrograde may also make us feel deeply tired on both a physical and mental level .\nTaking time out to calm not only your body , but also your mind will be valuable during this time .\nYou may feel this especially heightened under the Cancer Full Moon on January 6 .\nThere is some heightened energy around this Full Moon that can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spending time near water and finding ways to cool down your system from an energetic standpoint can be the antidote !\nOnce Mars stations direct on January 12 and Mercury follows on January 18 , things will begin speeding up and cosmic energy will begin flowing quickly and in new directions again .\nRemember , 2023 is the year of doors opening , so be sure you are knocking

guided to transform , to do away with the old , and rebirth yourself into something new .\nThis rebirth phase will still continue into 2023 , but don \u2019 t worry , you are nearing the end of your journey and this means that clarity is on the way .\nAs you move into 2023 , you will feel clearer about your path ahead and what you wish to focus on .\nYou may feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has taken place and

.\nVisiting a relaxing spot or even going to the spa will all have powerful benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly due to Chiron , the asteroid known as the wounded healer .\nIt is very active under this New Moon , reminding us that we can be whole ; we can lead a full and beautiful life , even though we have wounds that may never heal .\nConnect with this New Moon energy and allow these soothing , healing vibrations to travel where they need to go .\nAs we reach the end of December , Mercury will station retrograde on the 29th , joining Mars , which is also in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in retrograde can create some very sluggish energy .\nWe may feel mentally foggy or just find ourselves lacking motivation .\nMars will station direct again on January 12 , and Mercury will follow on January 18 , so

pause .\nSetting those goals and crossing things off your to-do list will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astrological new year , which falls on the March Equinox .\nThe Cancer Full Moon on January 6 , carries highly sensitive energy , which may also highlight where we need to pause , relax , and reflect .\nWe may find ourselves feeling confused about something or overly emotional .\nSit with whatever comes up for you rather than trying to suppress it .\nWhen we allow emotions to flow , they can become a guide , revealing to us how we can step into greater harmony .\nWhile 2023 will carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the journey .\nUse the energy of 2023 to channel your transformative journey in the direction of your choosing .\nKnow that you get a say !\n2023 will be a great year to push the boundaries on what you thought was possible and leap into the new .\nMars has been retrograde in your sign since the end of October .\nMars will leave retrograde on January 12 , but will remain in Gemini until March .\nThis is a very long time to have Mars in your corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusual and a sign from the Universe that you are being guided to work with its energy .\nMars is the ruler of the masculine , our feelings of motivation , our fears , our ambitions , our energy levels , our passions , and even our sexual desires .\nMars is also considered the God of War and can stir heated emotions or untapped aggressions within us .\nYou may have already felt these themes playing out in your life in some way , but if you haven \u2019 t , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we journey through Capricorn Season .\nWhatever comes up , take it as an opportunity to reinvent yourself and transform to a higher level of consciousness .\nAs Mars stations direct and eventually leaves Gemini , it will be easier to see the results of your hard work !\nThe Capricorn New Moon on December 23 is our last lunar cycle for 2022 .\nThis New Moon carries some healing energy , reminding us to be kind to ourselves and to find our state of wholeness .\nWe can have wounds that never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t exclude us from being whole .\nThis New Moon encourages us to radically accept all that we are and to love ourselves for who we are today , rather than trying to fix or change who we are .\nThis healing and self-acceptance energy comes from Chiron , the asteroid known as the wounded healer , which is very active under this New Moon .\nChiron also stations direct under this New Moon too , leaving its retrograde cycle .\nThere is a theme happening here of planets stationing direct and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major planets in retrograde !\nRetrograde energy always creates a reflective state that requires us to go back and look over things , so with all planets moving direct , we will have some great forward momentum in the cosmos and in our own lives .\nUntil this time , we are really being encouraged to slow down , pause , and make time for all the nagging thoughts and feelings that we tend to ignore .\nUse this time wisely Gemini , as it won \u2019 t be long before things are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capricorn Season which means that your Full Moon is on the way !\nFalling on January 6th , this Cancer Full Moon is extra powerful and carries some heightened energy that will stir your emotions and sensitivities .\nAs a sign that is already known for its sensitivities , this Full Moon may have you feeling extra emotional .\nThere is also a chance for miscommunications , or perhaps something will come up that just feels like the Universe is not working in your favor .\nThere could be a little disappointment around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be working overtime , making everything feel extra disappointing !\nWhenever there is strong emotional energy , it is important to focus on cleansing .\nYou can cleanse by spending time near water , clearing your auric field using your favorite tool , working with crystals , or just setting an intention to clear away all that no longer serves .\nFull Moons are naturally a good time for clearing and releasing , and there is a particularly strong cleansing energy attached to this one .\nYou may even feel the urge to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something new .\nBefore this Full Moon , we have the corresponding New Moon , which falls on December 23 in the sign of Capricorn .\nCapricorn sits opposite you on the wheel of the zodiac .\nYou are both the signs that lead us into the Solstice , so you share a special connection .\nWhenever Capricorn Season comes around , there can be a focus on the other or relationships in your life , and that is what you may feel stirring around this New Moon .\nChiron , the asteroid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this New Moon , encouraging you to heal wounds that block you from making connections with others .\nYou may also find yourself healing in a way that allows you to stay true to yourself and assert yourself when it comes to certain relationships .\nOne of the gifts Chiron \u2019 s energy gifts us is the gift of wholeness .\nWhile it is the asteroid of healing , it really is about finding our own sense of healing , no matter what wounds we carry .\nAll of us can be whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nChiron \u2019 s energy also reminds us that each of us has a gift , and that gift can be accessed through our wounds , not only when we transcend them but even when they are raw .\nWhat gifts can your wounds show you ?\nStay open to this question and see what inspiration arrives .\nAs we move into the grounded sign of Capricorn , you may naturally find yourself wanting to slow down and wrap up projects or situations that have been consuming far too much of your time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to feel that it \u2019 s time to take inventory of how you are spending your energy and what you no longer wish to dedicate your time to .\nYour energy and time are both precious resources , so be sure you are using them wisely !\nMars , the planet that rules over our energy levels is currently in retrograde , highlighting this energy in your life even more .\nMars retrograde can also create a slow-down effect where you may feel like you are taking one step forward and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this in any area of your life , it may be a sign that you need to pause and give things time to breathe .\nAs a fire sign , you are often rushing ahead and wanting to execute and take action , but with this Mars Retrograde energy , we are really being encouraged to slow down and take our time .\nUse this energy to practice patience and moving with slow , deliberate movements .\nBe fully present with whatever you are doing , and it will be easier to merge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This slow-down energy is also going to be magnified as Mercury also stations retrograde on December 29 until January 18 .\nFrom this period , things may feel foggy or confusing .\nIt may be hard to wrap your head around how you feel about something or what the best course of action is .\nAgain , if you are feeling any of this , use it as your opportunity to slow down , pause , and go within .\nYour inner self will have some wisdom for you here , so be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moon on December 23 , carries some healing energy , helping you to bring closure to something that has been weighing on you .\nYou may also find yourself bringing closure to a work project .\nIf you are thinking of switching jobs , this New Moon would be a good time to put your feelers out there to see what is available .\nThis is a good time to explore , research , and daydream about what you wish to move to next .\nAs we move into the new year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January 6 .\nThere is a sense of chaotic energy around this Full Moon .\nIt may be a very confusing time , and one where you are reassessing things in your life .\nOnce again , you may find yourself having to reconsider how you are spending your energy .\nIf you have been burning the candle at both ends or not listening to your body , this Full Moon may insist that you take rest and finally listen .\nBy the time Capricorn Season comes to an end however , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to move forward on things that previously felt confusing or tricky to navigate .\nCapricorn is a fellow earth sign , so this season always vibrates well with your soul .\nYou may find yourself thinking about new projects to tackle or what lessons and adventures you want to create for yourself in the new year .\nCapricorn energy can be very ambitious , so breathe some of this in , but don \u2019 t overdo it !\nWe have a lot of cosmic energy guiding us to slow down and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus on building our foundation and consolidating rather than aiming too high just yet .\nThe sturdiest buildings always have the best foundation , so use this time to focus on that .\nThe Capricorn New Moon on December 23 , offers the energy of new beginnings , but there is a little heaviness around it too .\nIt seems that even though we may want to bring fresh new things into our lives , we may have to be patient .\nChiron , the asteroid of healing , is very active under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are worthy of new beginnings despite the old wounds and traumas we may hold .\nChiron is actually known as the wounded healer , because it has been able to channel its wounds into powerful portals of wisdom and healing for others .\nChiron reminds us that our wounds don \u2019 t make us weaker , but rather more compassionate , more wise , and more connected to our own innate healing abilities .\nThese themes may come up for you under the Capricorn New Moon .\nYou may especially feel them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOne of the core wounds in the myth of Chiron is abandonment , so if you are struggling in a relationship , see if you can reflect on where abandonment issues may be coming up for you or your partner .\nWhat are you or your partner really afraid of losing ?\nIf you need to cut ties with a relationship , you may find it easier to do so under the Cancer Full Moon , which peaks in the new year on January 6 .\nAlternatively , you may find this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever issues you were struggling with under the New Moon .\nAs a Virgo , your mind-body connection is always very strong , so this is something to be mindful of as we wrap up 2022 and move into 2023 .\nWhen you are overly stressed or caught up in your mind , you tend to see it showing up on a physical level .\nIf you find this to be true , be sure you are making time to rest , quiet your mind , and practice self-care .\nAs we journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both Mars and Mercury in retrograde .\nMercury is one of your ruling planets , so you are going to feel this more than most .\nWith both these planets in retrograde , we may notice unresolved situations or feelings bubbling up to the surface .\nIt is also easier for us to feel stuck in our heads or confused about how to proceed .\nThis planetary energy can also lead to mishaps , miscommunications , and can easily trigger heated emotions .\nYou have the skills and tools to navigate through all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle with yourself .\nGo slow , and don \u2019 t overcommit or take on too much .\nBy keeping yourself in a state of balance , it will be much easier to remain level-headed and to focus on taking a grounded approach .\nYour focus shifts to your home and family life this Capricorn Season .\nYou may find yourself needing to juggle extra responsibilities in these areas or finding that you need to set greater boundaries in order to feel more at peace .\nWhile your home and family life may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also feel a pull towards your career and professional endeavors too .\nIn fact , you may find yourself playing a tug of war between the two .\nWhile this has the potential to create some added stress , Mars Retrograde is on your side .\nWhen Mars enters retrograde , it beckons us to reconsider how we have been choosing to spend our time and energy , and whether we have been focusing on things that are truly meaningful to us or not .\nOur time and energy are both limited and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good time to take stock and think about how you are choosing to spend your time , and if you like what results it is yielding you .\nOf course , sometimes we have no choice over where we need to spend our time , but we often do have a choice around how we wish to expend our energy .\nMars will remain retrograde until January 12 , so you will have a few weeks to work with this line of questioning and make changes if needed .\nKnow that even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep in mind , that we usually have to wait for Mars to leave retrograde before we really have the answers we are seeking .\nBe patient with this process , especially since Mercury will also station retrograde too from December 29-January 18 .\nWith Mercury also in retrograde , it can create a slow-down effect in the Universe , and make us really pause and reconsider before moving ahead .\nMany of us are traveling and busy with holiday plans during that time of year , so it \u2019 s going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carve out time for rest .\nIf something feels too much or you are hesitant to commit , listen to that voice rather than brushing it off or talking yourself into it out of obligation .\nWhile it is fine to do this sometimes , doing it all the time will only lead to burnout and resentment !\nThe Capricorn New Moon on December 23 carries some beautiful healing energy around it .\nIf you have been struggling physically , emotionally , or even mentally , this New Moon offers the opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , and with this fresh energy comes a healing .\nHealing can look different for everyone , so release any preconceived ideas about what healing you want , and stay open to the healing on offer .\nThis strong healing energy comes from the asteroid , Chiron which is known as the wounded healer .\nChiron has learned to take its wounds and channel them into powerful portals of wisdom , intuition , and healing for others .\nChiron has learned to live with its wounds and accept them , knowing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever fully heal .\nLike Chiron , you too can learn to accept your deeper wounds .\nYou too can learn to love and embody the idea that you are perfect and whole just as you are .\nAs a Libra , you are always putting yourself in other people \u2019 s shoes and shining your love in their direction .\nBut under this New Moon , it is time to shine the love in your own direction .\nIt is time to give the same compassion , kindness , and remorse you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may feel extra sensitive under this New Moon , or even extra grateful for any support you have received on your own healing journey .\nAs we move into the new year , there tends to be this pressure to set goals and aim high for the months ahead , but our current planetary energy shows that we would be far better off resting , relaxing , and taking time to pause .\nIf you are feeling this , give yourself permission to lean into it !\nSee if you can take some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMercury , the planet of communication and travel will be retrograde from December 29 until January 18 .\nWith Mercury in retrograde , we may find ourselves prone to miscommunications and mishaps .\nSince Mercury rules over travel , we may also find ourselves experiencing delays .\nThis is all pretty normal for holiday season travel anyway , so don \u2019 t worry !\nJust have a backup plan in case of any delays or baggage issues .\nAnd if you are met with any delays , trust in the Universe !\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all , and any delays or travel mishaps that it may inspire are usually due to a higher reason .\nSee if you can open to this idea , and trust that you are always right where you need to be !\nThe Full Moon on January 6 , carries some emotional energy .\nIt may also highlight something in your work life or feelings around your purpose .\nOnce again , you may find yourself thinking about how you wish to spend your energy , and if you there could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the things that excite you .\nDue to the strong emotional energy around this Full Moon , it may be hard to ground your feelings into something actionable , but this is ok .\nAllow yourself to feel .\nGive yourself space .\nAs the Full Moon energies dissipate , it will become easier to create a plan and make the changes you desire .\nAs the Sun crosses into Capricorn , we experience the Solstice .\nA time when the Sun \u201c stands still \u201d and we experience either the longest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is said that as the Solstice occurs , the energy grid of the planet shifts into a higher harmony and vibration .\nAs a sensitive soul , you are in a prime position to feel this .\nWhenever we have strong vibrational energy like this , it tends to adapt to the energy of our own body , giving us exactly what we need .\nWe may feel wiped out , indicating that we are in need of rest .\nOr , we may feel energized , indicating that it \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get things done .\nPay attention to your body , mind , and spirit as the Sun moves into Capricorn on December 21st .\nHonor where you are at , and if you feel the urge , spend some time in nature , soaking up the beautiful energies that are on offer .\nShortly after the Solstice , we begin a new lunar cycle with the Capricorn New Moon on December 23 .\nThis New Moon carries some gentle , healing vibrations , encouraging us to focus on loving ourselves , wounds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the wounded healer , is very active under this New Moon .\nIn mythology , Chiron was abandoned at birth and carried this wound of not being good enough , not being loved , and not being wanted .\nEventually however , Chiron learns to take this wound , and turn it into a portal of wisdom , intuition , compassion , intelligence , and healing for others .\nInstead of trying to \u201c fix \u201d this wound , Chiron recognizes that some wounds are just too deep to ever truly resolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superpower .\nOur wounds can be valuable teachers and instigators of our true purpose and passions in life .\nOur wounds , although painful , can lead us down some beautiful paths , and that \u2019 s what this New Moon celebrates .\nThis is a good time to reconnect with your wounds and to remember that even though they may hurt and weep , you can still lead a beautiful , fulfilled life .\nChiron \u2019 s energy also guides us to turn our wounds into powerful portals of healing , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be in service of others , or you may find yourself wanting to share your voice or message with a wider audience .\nPut your thoughts , wisdom , and ideas out into the world under this New Moon , as they will all surely blossom !\nAs we wrap up 2022 , Mercury , the planet of communication , stations retrograde on December 29 .\nThis can leave us prone to miscommunications or just feeling foggy around our thoughts .\nIf your mental chatter is loud , see if you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always valuable to do , it becomes extra beneficial when Mercury is retrograde !\nMars will also be retrograde too until January 12 .\nThis is an energy we have been working with since October , but with Mars and Mercury both retrograde together , the end of the year may feel particularly sluggish and stagnant .\nWe may even feel a little more confused than usual about how best to proceed .\nWhenever we have strong retrograde energy like this , it is always best to go within , reflect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhat wisdom does the past still have for you ?\nDuring retrogrades , our past very often holds the key .\nMercury is also the messenger of the gods , so pay attention to the intuition of your own inner \u201c God.\n\u201d Mercury will station direct again on January 18 , just as Capricorn Season is preparing to end .\nOnce Mercury is moving direct , you may begin to feel a little clearer and more certain about what you need to focus on in 2023 .\nThe Sun has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but now it is time to say goodbye .\nThe Sun is bright and luminous ; as it leaves your corner of the zodiac , things may feel a little dull .\nYou may also feel a dip in energy or a feeling of being zapped .\nThis come-down however , can help reveal all that was blinded by the Sun .\nAs the Sun leaves , you can see with greater clarity all the gifts and rewards it has brought your way !\nIn astrology , the Sun represents the core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it visits your zodiac , it allows us to feel more ourselves .\nIt highlights and awakens our own inner flame , reminding us of what is important and what makes us truly feel like ourselves .\nThe Sun can remind us of our inner light , our purpose , and what makes us feel alive .\nTake some time to explore these areas for yourself , as the trailing energy of the Sun will make it easier to connect .\nThe Capricorn New Moon on December 23 , is also a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fill your life with .\nNew Moons are always fantastic times of year for drawing things towards you .\nThey are like a magnet , so set some intentions , plant some seeds , put your wishes out to the Universe and trust what flows !\nThis New Moon falls at 1 degree of Capricorn , which is a supercharged degree for new beginnings .\nIf you want to revamp an area of your life , this New Moon will have a lot to offer !\nBut , keep in mind that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparing to go retrograde too , on December 29 .\nHaving strong retrograde energy like this can create the feeling of one step forward , two steps back .\nSo , don \u2019 t race ahead even if you want to start something new .\nTake your time .\nThis is your chance to build a solid foundation rather than focus on how high you want to go .\nThere will be plenty of time for that in the near future , so use this New Moon to call in , but don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big grand actionable steps just yet .\nBoth Mercury and Mars in retrograde , are calling us to focus on our past and the wisdom we can take from the road we have already traveled .\nBy revisiting the past , we can also celebrate where we are today .\nAs we move into 2023 , we have the Cancer Full Moon , which peaks on January 6 .\nThere is strong emotional energy around this Full Moon , and as a water sign , you may feel it stronger than most !\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ have boundaries in place , not just physical ones but also spiritual ones .\nIf you need , spend time in nature or work with crystals , and try not to take on the emotions of others as your own .\nYou tend to be a sponge , and this Full Moon can suck you in if you are not firm with your energetic boundaries .\nMoney matters may be on your mind under this Full Moon too .\nBe sure you are thinking with an abundant mindset , rather than one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotions of the Full Moon pass , you may also find it easier to put some actionable steps into place around your finances if needed .\nThis could include creating a budget , canceling some subscriptions , or finding alternative sources of income .\nIn fact , if you have a side project or have thought about turning a hobby into a business , there is supportive energy under this Full Moon !\nWith Mercury and Mars in retrograde until mid-January , focus on creating a foundation and putting a plan together .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ even into February and March , there will be a lot more supportive energy that will help you to push ahead and move quickly .\nWelcome to your Season !\nThe Sun is in your corner and shining brightly in your direction .\nI hope you are able to feel the warmth of the Sun , filling up your heart , reigniting your soul , and reminding you just how bright and special you are !\nYou are a special child of the Universe , a rare soul that was sent here for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sun in your corner is your reminder !\nWhen the Sun comes to stay , things can feel brighter , lighter , and more optimistic .\nIf you have been getting caught up in your responsibilities or losing sight of your fun and playful nature , this is your reminder to bring it back !\nYou are very good at doing the hard work , but you also need to make sure you find time for fun !\nFor you Capricorn , finding this lightness usually involves releasing some control and readjusting your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be firmer , but others will need to come down , allowing greater relaxation .\nYou will intuitively know what is best for you .\nThe Capricorn New Moon , on December 23 , carries the energy of new beginnings .\nIf your birthday falls within 2 days of this New Moon , know you will have the energy of new beginnings with you for the whole year !\nWhile there is strong new beginning energy around this New Moon , Mars is still in retrograde , and its friend , Mercury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December 29 .\nHaving both these planets in retrograde together can create a slow-down effect .\nWe can feel a little sluggish or even confused about how to proceed ahead or how to think .\nOur mind can become cluttered , and it can become easier for us to miscommunicate our intentions
