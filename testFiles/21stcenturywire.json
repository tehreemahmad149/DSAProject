CHAOS: 2022 Trends and Predictions from 21WIRE", "content": "Looking forward into the New Year , here are some predictions and trends to look out for .\nIn last year \u2019 s Trends and Predictions for 2021 , we identified a number of breaking trends and global developments \u2013 some of which accelerated to become the biggest stories of the year .\nOther subjects we flagged-up are still fluid situations today and will continue well into 2022 and beyond .\nNote that 2021 was the year the so-called \u2018 conspiracy theorists \u2019 were vindicated across the board ( yes , they were right about most major aspects of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will continue onwards .\nWe see a lot trends continuing to move into 2022 : the continued rise of alternative media , coupled with the increasing draconian political censorship efforts by governments and Big Tech .\nAlso , look for the continued flight of users away from social media giants like Twitter , Facebook and YouTube \u2013 again fuelled by corporate fascist censorship , as users migrate to other platforms like Telegram , GAB , Odysee and Rumble .\nOn the other technology front , we see the emergence of a real virtual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led by Mark Zuckerberg .\nAlso , 5G networks are being rapidly deployed now with little regard to public safety , and paving the way for the Internet of Things and Internet of Bodies , all coming into view now .\nAlso , expect more sabre rattling by the US and UK against China , which is already being used to trigger a renewed military , space and cyber arms race .\nAnd with inflation hitting hard , and fiat currencies being intentionally devalued , the potential for a massive disruption in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapse is omnipresent .\nMore importantly , as the great awakening gains momentum and the official narrative will continue to fall apart , expect the globalist establishment to get increasingly desperate in enacting their unpopular technocratic policies \u2013 or risk completely losing face , and losing power .\nAll of this sets the scene for creative chaos on both sides of this transforming paradigm .\nSo here it is \u2013 the good , the bad , and the ugly for 2022\u2026 Lockdown Redux ?\n\u2013 As the OMICRON invasion fizzles out , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is : will the totalitarians and quislings in government continue with their failed lockdown measures into the new year ?\nThe answer is most certainly yes , although not in every country .\nThis depends on local opinion polls and other indicators of public anger .\nHowever , there are still plenty of largely compliant populations who will not challenge \u2018 The Science \u2019 claims of their government and fall into line with the latest state-sponsored fear campaign .\nThis will be a long and chaotic year on the Covid policy front .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain though : they are running out of viable letters in Greek alphabet for which to name their new \u201c variants of concern.\n\u201d After Omicron is the letter Pi , and at the end is Omega .\nWithout the marketing and promotion of endless variants , then the endless pandemic would come to an abrupt end .\nIt is unlikely that government regimes and their new pandemic industrial complex will let go of this lucrative treasure trove that easily \u2013 not when the money is this good .\nWatch as the media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big variant , but then watch as it becomes a running joke \u2013 as more people are no longer under their hypnotic spell .\nBooster Mania \u2013 Despite the complete unworkability of the official COVID mythology , governments and their bosses in the pharmaceutical industrial complex will continue going hell for leather in pushing their experimental mRNA booster jabs .\nAs long as they can claim there \u2019 s a new variant on the loose \u2013 then they will keep pumping out experimental products to the public , paid for by state .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ in achieving the unattainable holy grail of \u2018 Zero Covid \u2019 , the harder governments will be trying to push them on to the public .\nYes , it \u2019 s counter intuitive , but government officials have now painted themselves into a corner by relying solely on the fraudulent use of an \u201c Emergency Use Authorization \u201d status for the experimental gene-jabs .\nSo expect booster mania to continue , including in the Netherlands where the government now wants there population to be jabbed with no less than 6 injections in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version of the novel coronavirus .\nEndless boosters for an endless pandemic .\nWatch them go for it .\nCollapse of the COVID narrative \u2013 If you listen closely now , you will see that the rats have already started to jump ship from their previously unassailable pandemic narrative .\n\u2018 Public health \u2019 actors are now in full retreat on a number of key fronts : the myth of the asymptomatic spread , the non-diagnostic PCR Test , previous claims that the vaccine would stop infections and transmissions of the virus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jabs , and their sacred COVID death toll .\nIt \u2019 s clear that Dr Fauci and the CDC director , as well as their cohort in Britain and the EU \u2013 have now lost control of their tangled COVID and vaccine narratives .\nListen closely and you will even hear this clown troupe saying that \u2018 people misinterpreted \u2019 the vaccine \u2019 s effectiveness.\n\u2019 In other words : the jab doesn \u2019 t seem to work ( in their own words , not ours ) .\nFor this reason , 2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the pandemic grifters refuse let go of their golden goose so easily .\nCrumbling of the climate hysteria \u2013 Greta \u2019 s big challenge in the new year will be to rekindle the global warming ( aka \u2018 climate change \u2019 ) narrative which was crowded-out over the last two years by the almighty Coroni .\nThings have been rough for the angry Swede and the climate cult , having to compete against Covid-19 for the top eschatological end times narrative for the 21st century .\nThe other problem here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the pseudo science world of computer modelling a la Neil Ferguson and the epidemiology science fiction scam .\nAs a result , intelligent punters are beginning to work out that the entire climate change end times narrative is based on this same type of fictional computer modelling \u2013 used by the UN \u2019 s illustrious IPCC which claims to be able to prediction the entire planetary weather system in 10 , 20 , 50 or 100 years time .\nAs this house of cards continues to collapse , expect climate zealots and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fire and brimstone , and the Green New Deal utopia narrative .\nThe more the MSM and establishment try to ram the climate hysteria down the throats of the public , the more skeptics will increase in numbers with the continued exposure of the postmodernist deception of the new secular religion designed to disguise a global takeover by elite technocrats .\nClimate Lockdowns \u2013 Will the globalist elites try to push the idea of climate lockdowns in 2022 ?\nThis is really the endgame for the Greta Thunberg-WEF social engineering project .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it \u2019 s going to be a really hard sell to implement it , for now .\nThe ease in which the public fell for the COVID-19 lockdown deception has no doubt encourage globalists that they might be able to pull the same scam under the guise of climate change .\nCertainly , governments now believe they can introduced climate lockdowns to supposedly \u2018 tackle \u2019 an imaginary climate crisis .\nRise of the Fascist Technocracy \u2013 Tragically , we are seeing the re-emergence of Nazism at a government level , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and further afield down under in Australia .\nIn order to enforce a baseless pretext for the draconian Vaccine Passport agenda , governments are ordering businesses to comply with the new totalitarian technocracy and instructing their police forces to continue abusing their populations .\nTechnocrats have all but declared open warfare against individual and human rights , and are busy dismantling the whole concept of democracy and republican forms of government .\nThis is largely a global trend , and being heavily pushed in the developed world .\nAs elites continue losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control measures , expect more violent confrontations with paramilitary police forces .\nVaccine Apartheid faltering badly \u2013 It \u2019 s now clear that the vaccine mandates being pushed by governments are being pushed back in the courts \u2013 for the simple reason that they are illegal and unconstitutional .\nThe only reason governments have been able to get away with this epic blag so far is that they are pumping-out the 24/7 fear propaganda and numbing the minds of the public into full compliance .\nWhile authoritarians have managed to get the ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will still have trouble sustaining the blag as fears of a killer virus subside in 2022 .\nLook for a massive backlash against authoritarian government pushing ridiculous vaccine segregation policies \u2013 forcing these governments to backpedal .\nIsrael vs Iran \u2013 Back in December it was revealed how the Israel Defense Forces held a large-scale exercise over the Mediterranean with dozens of fighter jets \u2013 simulating a strike against Iran \u2019 s nuclear program .\nThis came as Israeli officials stepped-up their rhetoric against the Islamic Republic of Iran , including threatening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tehran .\nAdd to this and increase in Israeli air assaults on its neighbor Syria .\nSo expect warhawks and Neocons to begin circling again , and the war drums to resume beating in 2022 , as Israel tries to court more support and cash from Washington .\nThe Fall of Fauci \u2013 2021 ended badly for the globalists \u2019 poster boy and Dr Antony Fauci .\nRobert F Kennedy \u2019 s new book The Real Anthony Fauci is now the No.1 seller on Amazon , and by the end of this battering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ languishing deep in history \u2019 s sordid dumpster .\nPreviously elevated a modern day saint by the media and political elites , \u201c America \u2019 s Doctor \u201d appears to have massively overplayed his hand and underestimated the public \u2019 s ability to research and understand how Big Pharma has captured every key government agency for its own benefit .\nWatch as the MSM begin to distance themselves from Big Pharma \u2019 s key government embed and career gatekeeper .\nAs Fauci goes , so does Pharma\u2026 .\nBig Pharma in retreat \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Big Pharma will begin teetering on the edge of oblivion as well \u2013 at least in terms of their disastrous and reckless roll-out of the experimental COVID-19 mRNA gene-jab .\nAs the data begins to pour in on vaccine adverse reactions , injuries and deaths , these modern-day snake oil barons will eventually face the sort of industry-reckoning suffered by Big Tobacco and glyphosate moguls like Monsanto .\nBig Pharma pushed too hard and too far this time , before cashing-in early at the expense of an unsuspecting public .\nBut people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the industry \u2019 s legal liability shield will not protect this wildly corrupt industry forever .\nThe clock is ticking .\nIt \u2019 s only a question of time now .\nExpansion of Clown World \u2013 The bad news is that Clown World is not going away .\nAs the establishment increases its corruption in government and expedites globalist and transnational corporate hegemony , they will require more clowns and incompetents to fill managerial positions , and thus , Clown World will unfortunately be expanding in scope and size .\nExpect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had previously escaped over-politicisation and woke identity politics , including the Military , Healthcare , and Sports .\nTheir goal is create dysfunction , aloofness , and to make a complete mockery and farce of democratic systems and constitutional forms of government , before making us beg for a new \u2018 global \u2019 solution to the crisis of confidence they created .\nDe-globalisation \u2013 In 2021 , the new buzzword in politics was \u201c The Supply Chain !\n\u201d \u2013 as government and media remain true to their old script , claiming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blamed on Coroni .\nSuddenly , everyone was muttering this previously benign term from Economics 101 .\n\u201c We must fix our broken supply chains !\nWe must Build Back Better !\n\u201d These disruptions serve the globalist objective which is the continue \u2018 de-globalisation \u2019 of certain industries , and limited mobility for the working and middle classes \u2013 which is all part and parcel of the Great Reset and UNSDG 2030 agenda .\nAgain , based on the imaginary computer-modelled climate change theory .\nConjured \u2018 Cyber threats \u2019 and cyber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by now : problem , reaction , solution .\nAside from the climatist fear-mongering and the endless pandemic , the next big project for the western establishment is to create a global \u201c cyber crisis \u201d and usher in a new Digital ID system for most mainline internet users .\nTo see the blue print for this next global crisis , you need look no further than Klaus Schwab \u2019 s crypto global technocracy advisor body , The World Economic Forum , who outlined this coming upheaval in its \u201c Cyber Polygon \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murky \u2018 cyber attack \u2019 ( by who ?\nTake your pick\u2026 ) followed by a \u201c Dark Winter , \u201d all helping to usher in Schwab \u2019 s Great Reset agenda .\nGet ready , it \u2019 s coming .\nBiden Gets Decommissioned \u2013 Is Joe Biden the worst US president in modern history ?\nAfter just one year , the polls seem to say so .\nJust 12 months ago he was preaching unity , and now he is busy dividing the country , and trying to impose medical apartheid through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are just too many other failed policies and scandals to mention : the immigration disaster at the US southern border , runaway inflation , the Afghanistan debacle , and his son Hunter Biden \u2019 s seedy escapades .\nAdd this the fact that Biden , now 79 years old , is now physically and mentally deteriorating in full public view .\nIt is very unlikely that Biden will run for re-election in 2024 .\nHow long until the Democrats finally move Shoeless Joe out of the White House and into retirement ?\nBy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early as Easter 2022 , and likely before the 2022 midterm elections where Democrats are hoping to avoid defeat in the House and Senate elections .\nWho will replace him ?\nIt may not be VP Kamala\u2026 Hillary \u2019 s triumphant return ?\n\u2013 Just before the new year , none other than Hillary Clinton reared her head , with a tearful reading her 2016 acceptance speech for the election she claims was stolen from her by Russians !\nWhy now ?\nIs she jockeying for position , as a VP under Biden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Harris ?\nThe former would mean that Kamala would have to be moved out before Biden is decommissioned .\nIt \u2019 s like a vapid version of Game of Thrones .\nEither way , we are now anticipating a possible rematch between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in 2024 .\nIsrael vs Iran \u2013 Back in December , it was revealed how the Israel Defense Forces held a large-scale exercise over the Mediterranean with dozens of fighter jets \u2013 simulating a strike against Iran \u2019 s nuclear program .\nThis came as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islamic Republic of Iran , including threatening to mount a unilateral military attack against Tehran .\nAdd to this and increase in Israeli air assaults against its neighbor Syria .\nSo expect warhawks and Neocons to begin circling again , and the war drums to resume beating in 2022 , as Israel tries to court more support and cash from Washington .\nNATO vs Russia war drums \u2013 In addition to stepping up tension in the Middle East , western war planners are desperate to ratchet-up the prospects of war with Russia .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ s foreign minister , Sergey Lavrov , warned that the Kremlin now perceives the US and its NATO allies , along with Ukraine \u2013 as stoking the war in eastern Ukraine .\n\u201c The civil war in Ukraine , ongoing for eight years , is far from over \u2026 .\nthe country \u2019 s authorities don \u2019 t intend to resolve the conflict \u201d said Lavrov .\nAt the very least , in 2022 , we can expect a series of limited skirmishes and provocations by Kiev backed by London and Washington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be blamed on Russia , and then used to trigger a new round of diplomatic and economic sanctions .\nThe Fall of Boris \u2013 It wasn \u2019 t long ago that British PM Boris Johnson came roaring into office with a giant BREXIT mandate .\nOh how times have changed , as Johnson was dealt another blow before Christmas , losing support in England \u2019 s \u201c Red Wall \u201d seats .\nThe reason for this is simple : people do not believe or trust their newly woke authoritarian pandemic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a top sales rep for the vaccine industry .\nPeople are tired of the COVID theatre , only politicians still haven \u2019 t worked out how badly they are doing on this front .\nBy getting rid of Boris , the Establishment can release a bit of public anger associated with failed lockdowns , the \u201c Build Back Better \u201d debacle , vaccine fanaticism , the government \u2019 s general attack on small-to-medium size businesses , and on the peoples \u2019 basic rights .\nWhether by inner party means , or through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be jettisoned in 2022 .\nThe Aliens \u2013 Will we finally visited by extraterrestrials ?\nFor this epic psy-op , timing is everything .\nPerhaps 2022 will be the year when the Establishment gets serious about unleashing its ominous ET narrative on the global population .\nWill it be a War of the Worlds plot , or will the aliens be carrying a deadly interstellar coronavirus causing us all the lockdown and take a few dozen more vaccines , curtesy of Bill Gates and Pfizer ?\nFunny enough , this intergalatic narrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agenda .\nIt would be the perfect unifying moment \u2019 for elites to wield the benevolent sword of global government over humanity .\nJust imagine .\nFor many , this could amount to a spiritual experience and could spawn a new religious paradigm , effectively reorienting the current cultural-religious mix .\nIf mainstream news is anything to go by , then the idea has already been seeded in the public domain now with MSM pundits enthusiastically airing stories about aliens and UFOs .\nWhat we are saying that things can get weirder\u2026 so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Aliens , the next perfect \u2018 unifying threat \u2019 would be the prospect of a giant asteroid heading towards earth .\nWe \u2019 re told it happened before : at impact site , known as the Chicxulub crater , near the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico , ending the dinosaur dominion on our jurassic planet .\nNo doubt , any 21st century asteroid threat would also prompt calls for a \u2018 unified global response \u2019 to this apocalyptic existential threat .\nNot to mention , it would give elites the chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSo there it is .\n2022 , boldly going where no man or woman has gone before .\nHOW ACCURATE WERE

the more salient revelations in any crisis can be found when observing which sections of society exhibit the most zealotry in advocating for authoritarian rules and regulations .\nIn the case of

.\nA major \u2018 outbreak \u2019 of COVID takes place in the remotest of locations \u2013 despite very strict health precautions taken by this research team on their way to the South Pole .\nWhat conclusions can we draw from this latest vignette ?\nWhat exactly is the PCR Test picking up ?\nJerusalem Post reports\u2026 .\nA coronavirus outbreak has hit one of the world \u2019 s most remote regions , with two-thirds of the 25 workers at the Belgian Princess Elisabeth Polar Station in Antarctica having caught the virus since mid-December , according to the Le Soir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the

Among the Panic-Mongers", "content": "A new climate panic is gripping the far-Left profiteers of doom .\nThose few of Them who are climate scientists have made fame and fortune by telling us the world is toast unless the once-free West ( though responsible for only a fifth of the world \u2019 s sins of emission ) commits economic hara-kiri .\nThe cost of placating climate Communism is already in the quadrillions .\nHowever , They are becoming aware that Their official climate narrative is rooted in a grave error of physics \u2013 an error so elementary that it can be described here .\nAt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much warming we may cause , They forgot the Sun was shining .\nBy 1850 , before we had any measurable impact on global temperature , direct warming from naturally occurring greenhouse gases other than water vapor was about 8 degrees absolute ( Kelvin ) .\nYet the total natural greenhouse effect by that year was 32 K \u2013 the difference between the measured global temperature of 287 K and the sunshine-only emission temperature of 255 K. The 24 K difference between the 8 K direct and 32 K final greenhouse-gas warming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a knock-on , additional warming chiefly caused by more water vapor in warmer air .\nThus , They imagined , the system-gain factor \u2013 by which direct warming before feedback response is multiplied to give final warming including feedback response \u2013 was about 32 / 8 , or 4 .\nSince direct warming by doubled CO is little more than 1 K , they imagined that final doubled-CO warming \u2013 roughly equivalent to all the final warming we may cause throughout the 21st century \u2013 would be about 4 K. That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water-vapor feedback ( all others broadly self-cancel ) must respond not only to direct warming , such as greenhouse-gas warming , but also to the surely observable fact that the Sun is shining .\nAfter correction to take account of the feedback response to the 255 K sunshine temperature that would subsist on Earth if there were no greenhouse gases in the air at all , the system-gain factor in 1850 was not 32 / 8 , or 4 , as They had imagined , but ( 255 + 32 ) / @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.09 .\nAfter that strikingly simple correction to allow for the fact that very nearly all feedback response in 1850 was a response not to preindustrial greenhouse gases but to the sunshine , if the feedback regime today is as it was in 1850 we can expect not 4 K warming this century but a net-beneficial 1.1 K. That ends the \u201c climate emergency \u201d .\nSure enough , the rate of global warming since the end of the Second World War has been equivalent to about 1.1 K per century , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medium-term warming confidently predicted by IPCC in 1990 .\nWhat is more , as has been widely unreported , there has been no global warming at all for approaching eight years ( see below ) , and no statistically-significant warming for about a decade .\nBut what if feedback strength is greater today than it was in 1850 ?\nAfter all , the influence of the Sun is so dominant that an increase of little more than 1 % in feedback strength compared with that year would push up the 1.1 K final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this century by 250 % to Their officially predicted 4 K. Their problem is this .\nWhen James Hansen , the far-Left agitator at NASA , first published the error in 1984 , he imagined the system-gain factor was somewhere between 2 and 4 \u2013 a tacit admission that we do not know the feedback strength to within 100 % , let alone 1 % .\nThe uncertainty in feedback strength in IPCC \u2019 s leaden , prolix Assessment Reports is still greater .\nIt ranges from little more than zero to not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the least well-constrained quantities in the whole of physics .\nThat means climatology has not the faintest idea how much \u2013 or , rather , how little \u2013 global warming we may cause .\nAll those multi-thousand-page reports are pure guesswork .\nThere is very little reason to suppose the feedback regime today is not exactly as it was in 1850 .\nThe error arose when Hansen , copied by all climatologists since , borrowed feedback math from control theory , a mature branch of engineering physics , without understanding what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curse of interdisciplinary compartmentalization in science .\nCorrecting the error removes Their near certainty of large and dangerous anthropogenic warming .\nIt destroys Their pretext to shut down the West .\nHere is why .\nIn the past 30 years , notwithstanding the increasingly hysterical rhetoric at the UN \u2019 s interminable annual climate gabfests , anthropogenic greenhouse-gas forcing \u2013 our influence on temperature \u2013 has increased in a near-perfect straight line by one-thirtieth of a unit per year .\nWith no mitigation , that increase would continue for another 30 years till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead to go in a straight line to net-zero emissions by 2050 , about half the 1 unit of forcing that would otherwise have arisen between now and then would be abated\u2026

@ @ @ @ claims .\nOther key data points include : \u2022 None Hospitalizations in Indiana are also higher than before the COVID shots were rolled out in in 2021 , and the highest they \u2019 ve been in five years \u2022 None The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India also reports a 41 % rise in death claims in 2021 \u2022 None COVID-19 deaths were significantly lower in 2021 than 2020 , so COVID-19 can be ruled out as the cause for this historical rise in excess deaths and disabilities .\nRight now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID jabs Are we witnessing a a disturbing trend here ?\nSince COVID-19 isn \u2019 t killing younger , healthy Americans , what is ?\nWhat changed in 2021 that might have such a devastating effect on people \u2019 s health ?\nWell , the most obvious change is that more than 100 million Americans got the experimental COVID shots , and doctors and scientists have elucidated several mechanisms by which these gene transfer technologies might injure or kill .\nAs reported by vaccine safety blogger Steve Kirsch:6 \u201c Normally death rates don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very stable .\nIt would take something REALLY BIG to have an effect this big .\nThe effect size is 12-sigma.7 That is an event that would happen by pure chance every 2.832 years .\nThat \u2019 s very rare .\nIt \u2019 s basically never .\nThe universe is only 14 billion years old which is 1.413 .\nIn other words , the event that happened is not a statistical \u2018 fluke.\n\u2019 Something caused a very big change \u2026 Whatever it is that is causing this , it is bigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s affecting nearly everyone.\n\u201d Kirsch lists 14 clues as to what this deadly \u201c something \u201d might be , including the following:8 Adverse Events May Be More Underreported Than Calculated \u201c We know that about 3M people die a year in the U.S.10 75 % are over 65 years old , so that leaves us with 750K deaths per year for under 65 .\nIf that jumped by 40 % from pre-pandemic levels in Q3 and Q4 , we should assume that Q2 was the ramp up period ( we \u2019 ll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nSo that is 75K deaths per quarter for Q3 and Q4 and half of that , 37K deaths in Q2 .\nSo that means roughly 187K excess deaths are probably happening for ages 18-64 due to some new cause.\n\u201d He then goes on to compare that rough estimate of 187,000 excess deaths to the U.S .\nVaccine Adverse Events Reporting System ( VAERS ) which , as of the December 24 , 2021 , data release , included 2,156 deaths between the ages of 17 and 65 .\nSubtracting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , multiplied by Kirsch \u2019 s calculated underreporting factor ( URF ) of 4111 gives us 87,000 deaths .\nIn other words , assuming vaccine injuries are underreported by a factor of 41 , the real death toll from the COVID jab would be 87,000 .\nHowever , that \u2019 s 100,000 short of the 187,000 excess death rate calculated above .\nThis means \u201c either there is another effect at play which is actually killing more people 18 to 64 than the vaccine is , ( unlikely but possible ) , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 41 is underestimating deaths by a factor of 2.15.\n\u201d Kirsch is not alone in suspecting the novel

of the greatest beneficiaries and power-brokers of the new pandemic economy .\nFor this reason , it is vitally important to pay close attention to these high-level \u2018 war gaming \u2019

\u201d initiative was held for 10 days , beginning Dec. 9 , 2021 , at the Israeli Finance Ministry in Jerusalem .\nIt was relocated to Jerusalem from the Dubai World Expo over concerns about the Omicron variant .\nIsrael led a 10-country contingent that also included treasury officials from the U.S. , Austria , Germany , Italy , the Netherlands , Switzerland , Thailand and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizations , such as the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , World Bank and Bank of International Settlements ( BIS ) , also participated .\nDescribed as a simulated \u201c war game , \u201d the exercise sought to model the response to various hypothetical large-scale cyberattacks on the global financial system , including the leaking of sensitive financial data on the \u201c Dark Web , \u201d hacks targeting the global foreign exchange system , and subsequent bank runs and market chaos fueled by \u201c fake news.\n\u201d However , the main theme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much the simulation of such cyberattacks but , as the name of the initiative implies , the strengthening of global cooperation in cybersecurity and the financial sector .\nAs reported by Reuters , participants in the simulation discussed multilateral responses to a hypothetical global financial crisis .\nThe idea of simulated delinking from major currencies raised some eyebrows because of its timing \u2014 on the same day participants gathered to launch \u201c Collective Strength , \u201d reports circulated that the Biden administration was considering removing Russia from the global electronic-payment-messaging system known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication .\nThis measure would be part of a package of economic sanctions the U.S. would levy against Russia should it attack Ukraine .\nHowever , what may raise even more eyebrows is the list of participants in the \u201c Collective Strength \u201d simulation , which includes : the IMF and World Bank , and indirectly , the World Economic Forum ( WEF ) .\nIt was the WEF , along with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health , which ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October 2019 .\nAs previously reported by The Defender , the WEF also supported the development of financial instruments , such as credit and debit cards , that would track \u201c personal carbon allowances \u201d on an individualized basis .\nAn executive summary issued in November 2020 by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , in collaboration with the WEF , provided a rundown of just the type of scenario that was simulated as part of \u201c Collective Strength.\n\u201d The report \u2019 s authors , Tim Maurer and Arthur Nelson , described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c an unprecedented digital transformation \u2026 accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\u201d In such a world , the authors argued , \u201c cybersecurity is more important than ever.\n\u201d Describing protection of the global financial system as an \u201c organizational challenge , \u201d the report pointed out there is no clear global actor in charge of protecting the global financial system or its digital infrastructure .\nThe executive summary went so far as to describe a \u201c disconnect between the finance , the national security and the diplomatic communities.\n\u201d The solutions identified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The need for \u201c greater clarity \u201d regarding roles and responsibilities \u2022 Reducing fragmentation and increasing \u201c internationalization \u201d among \u201c siloed \u201d financial institutions \u2022 Developing a model that can then be used in unspecified \u201c other \u201d sectors .\nThis set of recommendations was classified by the authors in their report under \u201c Digital Transformation : Safeguard Financial Inclusion.\n\u201d One such recommendation reads as follows : \u201c The G20 should highlight that cybersecurity must be designed into technologies used to advance financial inclusion from the start rather than included as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to advance financial inclusion from the start \u201d would appear to include digital \u201c health passports \u201d and accompanying \u201c digital wallets.\n\u201d It also seems to be aligned with the United Nations \u2019 Sustainable Development Goals \u2014 in particular , Goal 16.9 , which calls for the provision of a digital legal identity for all , including newborns , by 2030 .\nGoal 16.9 also brings to mind the European Union \u2019 s insistence that its vaccine passport , the so-called \u201c Green Pass , \u201d which is used in numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those with natural immunity from all sorts of public and private spaces , protects individuals \u2019 privacy .\nIn a further connection between two distinct issues \u2014 security of the global financial system and public health \u2014 the GAVI Vaccine Alliance called for \u201c innovations that leverage new technologies to modernize the process of identifying and registering the children who are most in need of life-saving vaccines.\n\u201d However , the use of these technologies would not stop with registering childhood vaccinations .\nGAVI described potential uses of these \u201c new technologies \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d including the broadly defined \u201c financial services.\n\u201d The authors of the Carnegie Endowment executive summary mirrored their proposals in a spring 2021 article that appears on the IMF \u2019 s website , although issues of \u201c financial inclusion \u201d are left out .\nWhile the two authors of the Carnegie report , and the participants in the \u201c Collective Strength \u201d initiative , emphasize the need for the financial system and its digital data to be better protected , it remains unclear how a continued transformation toward a fully digital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c secure.\n\u201d Consider , for instance , the following remark by Micha Weis , financial cyber manager at the Israeli finance ministry , in reference to \u201c Collective Strength \u201d : \u201c [ a ] ttackers are 10 steps ahead of the defender.\n\u201d Such words don \u2019 t offer much comfort to those who are already wary of \u201c FinTech , \u201d or the increasing proximity between \u201c Big Tech \u201d and \u201c Big Finance.\n\u201d Similarly , yet another \u201c simulation \u201d of a large-scale and destructive global catastrophe will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of \u201c Event 201 \u201d and what followed thereafter \u2014 infamously described on March 20 , 2020 , by

Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett all objected to the federal blackmail and coercion for health-care workers who refuse the experimental mRNA gene-jab .\nNot surprisingly , radical leftwing activist justices Stephen G. Breyer , Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan all voted in favour draconian vaccine mandates in the workplace \u2013 leaving many Americans to question whether these Supreme Court justices still regard the Bill of Rights and numerous international human rights treaties and conventions which prohibit imposing medical experiments on citizens \u2013 as legitimate .\nWhile the lower courts were somewhat split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impose such heavy-handed requirements , businesses and 27 Republican-led states have nonetheless asked the court to stop any workplace requirements proposed via OSHA which were upheld by a lower court .\nThe Biden administration is now insisting that its coercive vaccine policies for health-care workers \u2013 which courts had previously placed on hold \u2013 be allowed to move forward .\nHowever , it is believed that the President \u2019 s insistence to jab federally-funded healthcare workers could spur-on a mass exodus of staff \u2013 perhaps hundreds of thousands ( if not millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from those facilities nationwide \u2013 thus , creating a new crisis that could force these Medicare and Medicade providers to begin rationing care .\nAs to the Court \u2019 s reasoning , here are some highlights : \u2022 The Secretary of Labor likely \u201c lacked authority to impose the mandate.\n\u201d In making this finding , the Court noted that the OSHA Mandate affects millions of Americans \u2013 and that the Court expects \u201c Congress to speak clearly when authorizing an agency to exercise powers of vast economic and political significance.\n\u201d The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not \u201d plainly authorize the mandate .\n( The major questions doctrine . )\n\u2022 COVID-19 \u201c is not an occupational hazard.\n\u201d Allowing the OSHA Mandate \u201c would significantly expand OSHA \u2019 s regulatory authority without clear congressional authorization.\n\u201d Justice Gorsuch \u2013 with whom Justices Thomas and Alito joined \u2013 added some important points in his concurring opinion : \u2022 The OSHA Mandate fails the major question doctrine , as \u201c Congress has nowhere clearly assigned so much power to OSHA.\n\u201d In fact , \u201c a majority of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s regulation.\n\u201d \u2022 \u201c The Court rightly applies the major questions doctrine and concludes that this lone statutory subsection does not clearly authorize OSHA \u2019 s mandate.\n\u201d \u2022 \u201c Historically , such matters have been regulated at the state level by authorities who enjoy broader and more general governmental powers .\nMeanwhile , at the federal level , OSHA arguably is not even the agency most associated with public health regulation .\nAnd in the rare instances when Congress has sought to

Release All Vaccine and Treatment Data Immediately\u2019", "content": "The British Medical Journal ( BMJ ) , one of the world \u2019 s oldest and most prestigious medical journals , has now called for the full and immediate release of all data relating to the COVID-19 experimental vaccines and treatments .\nAccording to the BMJ , \u2018 Data should be fully and immediately available for public scrutiny.\n\u2019 Will the pharmaceutical cartel members Pfizer , AstraZeneca , Moderna and others , along with their allies in government regulatory bodies like the FDA comply with this crucial request ?\nIn the pages of The BMJ a decade ago , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it came to light that governments around the world had spent billions stockpiling antivirals for influenza that had not been shown to reduce the risk of complications , hospital admissions , or death .\nThe majority of trials that underpinned regulatory approval and government stockpiling of oseltamivir ( Tamiflu ) were sponsored by the manufacturer ; most were unpublished , those that were published were ghostwritten by writers paid by the manufacturer , the people listed as principal authors lacked access to the raw data , and academics who requested access to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tamiflu saga heralded a decade of unprecedented attention to the importance of sharing clinical trial data.56 Public battles for drug company data,78 transparency campaigns with thousands of signatures,910 strengthened journal data sharing requirements,1112 explicit commitments from companies to share data,13 new data access website portals,8 and landmark transparency policies from medicines regulators1415 all promised a new era in data transparency .\nProgress was made , but clearly not enough .\nThe errors of the last pandemic are being repeated .\nMemories are short .\nToday , despite the global rollout of covid-19 vaccines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data underlying the trials for these new products remain inaccessible to doctors , researchers , and the public\u2014and are likely to remain that way for years to come.16 This is morally indefensible for all trials , but especially for those involving major public health interventions .\nPfizer \u2019 s pivotal covid vaccine trial was funded by the company and designed , run , analysed , and authored by Pfizer employees .\nThe company and the contract research organisations that carried out the trial hold all the data.17 And Pfizer has indicated that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data until May 2025 , 24 months after the primary study completion date , which is listed on ClinicalTrials.gov as 15 May 2023 ( NCT04368728 ) .\nClive de Carle 's Natural Health essentials of the finest quality , including vitamin & mineral supplements here .\nThe lack of access to data is consistent across vaccine manufacturers.16 Moderna says data \u201c may be available \u2026 with publication of the final study results in 2022.\n\u201d 18 Datasets will be available \u201c upon request and subject to review once the trial is complete , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date of 27 October 2022 ( NCT04470427 ) .\nAs of 31 December 2021 , AstraZeneca may be ready to entertain requests for data from several of its large phase III trials.19 But actually obtaining data could be slow going .\nAs its website explains , \u201c timelines vary per request and can take up to a year upon full submission of the request.\n\u201d 20 Underlying data for covid-19 therapeutics are similarly hard to find .\nPublished reports of Regeneron \u2019 s phase III trial of its monoclonal antibody therapy REGEN-COV flatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made available to others.21 Should the drug be approved ( and not just emergency authorised ) , sharing \u201c will be considered.\n\u201d For remdesivir , the US National Institutes of Health , which funded the trial , created a new portal to share data ( https : //accessclinicaldata.niaid.nih.gov/ ) , but the dataset on offer is limited .\nAn accompanying document explains : \u201c The longitudinal data set only contains a small subset of the protocol and statistical analysis plan objectives.\n\u201d We are left with publications but no access to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is worrying for trial participants , researchers , clinicians , journal editors , policy makers , and the public .\nThe journals that have published these primary studies may argue that they faced an awkward dilemma , caught between making the summary findings available quickly and upholding the best ethical values that support timely access to underlying data .\nIn our view , there is no dilemma ; the anonymised individual participant data from clinical trials must be made available for independent scrutiny .\nJournal editors , systematic reviewers , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little beyond a journal publication , but regulatory agencies receive far more granular data as part of the regulatory review process .\nIn the words of the European Medicine Agency \u2019 s former executive director and senior medical officer , \u201c relying solely on the publications of clinical trials in scientific journals as the basis of healthcare decisions is not a good idea \u2026 Drug regulators have been aware of this limitation for a long time and routinely obtain and assess the full documentation ( rather than just publications ) .\n\u201d 22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drug Administration is believed

US and its allies bluffing over a war with Russia ?\nIs NATO willing to start a world war over the issue of its own expansion ?\nA military confrontation seems unlikely , and not at all practical for either side .\nAt present , a new bill sits before the US Senate which would impose unprecedented new sanctions against Russia , as well as Russian individuals said to be \u2018 close to President Vladimir Putin.\n\u2019 These measures would be implemented immediately in the event that Russia is deemed to have \u2018 invaded \u2019 Ukraine .\nWhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all but certain according to nearly every western politician and media platform , this rumor does not correspond with reality .\nNew York Times senior reporter David Sanger jumped on it : \u201c Mr .\nPresident , it sounds like you \u2019 re offering some way out here , some off-ramp\u2014an informal assurance that NATO is not going to take in Ukraine\u2026 and we would never put nuclear weapons there.\n\u201d Sanger went on to say Russia \u201c wants us to move all of our nuclear weapons out of Europe and not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Biden quickly said \u201c No , there \u2019 s not space for that.\n\u201d Biden \u2019 s blink was a break in the warlike atmosphere that has prevailed endlessly .\nKatrina van den Heuvel wrote the day before in The Washington Post that \u201c Hotheads [ were ] having a field day .\nA White House task force that includes the CIA [ was ] reportedly contemplating U.S. support for a guerrilla war if Russia seizes Ukraine ; Russian hawks talk of a military deployment to Cuba and Venezuela.\n\u201d Biden had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managers from the \u2018 Blob , \u2019 marinated in successive debacles in Iraq , Libya , Syria , Yemen and more.\n\u201d Guns and sanctions are the U.S. empire \u2019 s preferred options , van den Heuvel said : \u201c with about 800 military bases outside the United States , \u201d the U.S. has \u201c more bases than diplomatic missions .\n( Russia \u2019 s only military bases outside the former Soviet Union are in Syria . )\n\u201d She added that Secretary of State Blinken and the Blob \u201c talk about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we make the rules , often exempting ourselves from their application.\n\u201d In the end , it comes down to a concept in geopolitics known as spheres of influence .\nTranslated , this term basically means : \u2018 we reserve the right to exercise our dominance in this region as far as it \u2019 s deemed necessary and in our direct security interest.\n\u2019 If only it were that simple .\nThe reality is that in a post-Soviet globalized world , it \u2019 s becoming increasingly difficult to know where to draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a struggle for the US who have over 1,000 military bases and facilities around the world , and insist on managing a global sphere of influence .\nIn other words , Washington is anything but consistent when it comes to where and when it throws its weight around , or what it deems acceptable from its international rivals .\n\u201c When will the U.S. stop lying to itself about global politics ?\n\u201d asked CUNY Professor Peter Beinart , writing in the New York Times on January 13 .\nHe took issue with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pontificated last month that \u201c One country does not have the right to dictate the policies of another or to tell that country with whom it may associate ; one country does not have the right to exert a sphere of influence .\nThat notion should be relegated to the dustbin of history.\n\u201d Beinart commented : \u201c It \u2019 s a noble principle , just not one the United States abides by .\nThe United States has exercised a sphere of influence in its own hemisphere for almost 200 years , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States \u2018 should consider any attempt \u2019 by foreign powers \u2018 to extend their system to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety \u2019 .\n\u201d Blinken \u2019 s dustbin of history was still around in 2018 , Beinart said , when Trump \u2019 s Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called the Monroe Doctrine \u201c as relevant today as it was the day it was written.\n\u201d And Trump \u2019 s National Security Adviser John Bolton boasted that \u201c the Monroe Doctrine is alive and well.\n\u201d Blinken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence are concerned .\nThe U.S. , for him , has the right to wield influence

what to expect next\u2026 Press conference with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine , Dmytro Kuleba ( Image Source : NATO ) The days of unchallenged U.S./NATO dominance are over For some reason , in the aftermath of this month \u2019 s failed talks among the Russian , American and NATO representatives in Geneva , everybody is talking as though they believe Russia \u2019 s invasion of Ukraine is imminent .\nFrom the officials of the U.S. State Department , Pentagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the media , nearly everyone is talking as though they have not the slightest doubt that Russia intends to invade .\nHowever , in a Friday meeting with president Biden , Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged Biden not to provoke panic , saying that he did not see a greater threat now then during a similar massing of troops last spring .\nRussian president Vladimir Putin is indeed both a cautious and calculating leader who has increased Russia \u2019 s strength and global position incrementally over the last twenty years .\nHis current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s newfound alliance with China , building up Russia \u2019 s military strength , cementing a Eurasian union , and increasingly moving into the Middle East and expanding alliances with pro-Russian regimes there , notably in Syria and Iran .\nThese maneuvers threaten U.S. and western hegemony and may prove detrimental to the global banking cartel which is at the forefront of the push to try and provoke war and weaken and destroy Russia today .\nThe 1990 promise : not one inch eastward !\nLet \u2019 s briefly summarize the recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West .\nIn February 1990 the Soviet Union was still intact and Germany still divided : West Germany was a NATO member and East Germany was a communist , Soviet bloc country .\nThe U.S. Government asked Secretary General Mikhail Gorbachev for the Soviet Union \u2019 s cooperation on its plan for German reunification .\nIn consideration for Soviet withdrawal from East Germany , U.S. Secretary of State James Baker promised that NATO would not expand \u201c one inch eastward.\n\u201d This commitment was reiterated by other U.S. officials .\nThe Soviets withdrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. broke its promise and , over the next 27 years , the NATO alliance expanded many inches eastward , adding 14 new member states , all of them in the direction of Russia \u2019 s borders .\nA glance at the \u201c before \u201d and \u201c after \u201d maps is enough to see why Russia feels concerned about this : Today , the alliance is in the process of absorbing Ukraine and Georgia with the view to their eventual full membership .\nThis represents a \u201c red line \u201d for Russia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open to any \u201c European state in a position to further the principles of [ the North Atlantic Treaty ] and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area.\n\u201d Despite the fact that the Communist bloc no longer exists , the NATO alliance regards Russia as an enemy and consistently maintains a hostile posture toward it .\nOver the years , NATO has nearly quadrupled its military forces near Russia \u2019 s borders .\nAs professor Stephen Cohen noted in 2016 , \u201c The last time there was this kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s borders was when Nazis invaded Russia in 1941 .\nThere has never been anything like this .\nDuring the 40-year Cold War there was this vast buffer zone that ran from the Soviet borders all the way to Berlin .\nThere were no NATO or American troops there .\nThis is a very radical departure on the part of the [ Obama ] administration.\n\u201d Indeed , NATO has continued to stockpile heavy weaponry , building up permanent logistics infrastructure , and deploying more and more troops along Russian borders .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d bases in Romania and Poland , deployed nuclear bomb-capable aircraft close to Russia and allocated more than $ 8 billion of U.S. taxpayers \u2019 money to upgrade its arsenal of B-61 nuclear bombs kept in the United States and five other NATO-member nations .\nIn 2017 Ukraine \u2019 s Parliament passed legislation making its membership in NATO a strategic policy objective .\nIn 2019 , this objective was enshrined in Ukraine \u2019 s constitution .\nAnd while its full membership in NATO is ostensibly not on the table , the alliance is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a partner , which will bring NATO right onto Russia \u2019 s doorstep .\nThe cooperation between Ukraine and NATO began in 1994 .\nIn July 2013 ( that \u2019 s right , five months before the Maidan coup kicked off ) , NATO began to implement the \u201c Defense Education Enhancement Program \u201d ( DEEP ) in Ukraine , nothing short of a comprehensive overhaul of Ukraine \u2019 s military training and educational institutions .\nFrom 2013 through 2018 , it deployed more than 350 training teams focused not only on educating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation of Ukrainian diplomats and high-level officials \u201d as well as press officers .\nThis is important to keep in mind because , when Ukraine \u2019 s \u201c high level officials \u201d speak to Western audiences in polished prose and fluent English , usually these are not democratically elected representatives of the people of Ukraine but rather NATO \u2019 s own trained flaks delivering well-rehearsed talking points\u2026 PLEASE

financial transparency .\nThe group \u2019 s war chest has raised alarms with transparency watchdogs and charity auditors after it was recently confirmed that BLM took in $ 90 million throughout 2020 , some of which was \u201c distributed to their partner organizations , \u201d but had a cool $ 60 million left in its accounts \u2013 with seemingly no one in charge of the organization and its funds

California threatened to hold the charity \u2019 s leaders personally liable over its lack of financial transparency .\nThe move comes less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation found that BLM has had no known leader in charge of its $ 60 million bankroll since its co-founder resigned in May .\nCalifornia and Washington recently ordered BLM to cease all fundraising activities in their blue states due to the failure of the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation , the legal entity that represents the national BLM movement , to report information about its finances in 2020 , the year it raised tens of millions amid the racial protests and riots that followed George Floyd \u2019 s killing .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken immediate action , \u201d an unidentified spokesperson for the BLMGNF told the

featured prominently on BLM \u2019 s website was nowhere to be found as of Wednesday evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Washington Examiner on Tuesday that \u201c BLMGNF is prohibited from soliciting donations so long as its status is listed as delinquent.\n\u201d Despite the notice , BLM accepted a $ 1 donation from a Washington Examiner reporter based in California on Wednesday morning .\nThe California DOJ said Wednesday afternoon that it would not confirm or deny an investigation into BLM so as to \u201c protect its integrity.\n\u201d BLM also received notice from the state of Washington on Jan. 5 to \u201c immediately cease \u201d all fundraising activities in the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could face fines of $ 2,000 for each violation , but as recently as Monday , the charity accepted a $ 1 contribution from a Washington resident .\nIndiana Attorney General Todd Rokita previously said BLM \u2019 s refusal to answer basic questions about its finances and operations fits a common and disturbing pattern .\n\u201c It appears that the house of cards may be falling , and this happens eventually with nearly every scam , scheme , or illegal enterprise , \u201d Rokita , a Republican , said in an interview with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patterns that scams kind of universally take : failure to provide board members , failure to provide even executive directors , failure to make your filings

of AIDS (and a new vaccine)", "content": "In the past few days the topic of HIV/AIDS has been thrust back into the spotlight .\nOn 27 January , it was announced that Moderna is launching clinical trials for a new HIV vaccine using mRNA technology .\nA few days later on 3 February , Oxford University researchers published a study in the journal Science claiming discovery of the \u201c VB variant \u201d of HIV , and describing it as \u201c highly virulent \u201d .\nThis news about the VB variant \u2019 s higher virulence was a point that mainstream news media made sure to repeat and amplify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covering the story : \u2022 New Scientist : \u2018 VB \u2019 is a new and more infectious variant of HIV \u2013 but it is treatable \u2022 Daily Mail : New HIV super-strain is found in the Netherlands : Highly infectious variant makes people ill twice as quickly While the study found viral loads of those infected with VB could be up to 5.5 times higher , the large number of mutations caused several MSM outlets to declare it a \u2018 super-mutant \u2019 or \u2018 super-strain \u2019 .\nThat some of the MSM are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problematic , however .\nThe study makes very clear that this variant of HIV has been circulating since at least 1992 , that the most recent case was diagnosed in 2014 , and that in total only 109 individuals with the strain could be found .\nThe variant is not new ; the only new part is the research identifying this variant as distinct from other strains of HIV .\nBut fear sells .\nLuckily , this scary \u2018 new \u2019 variant of HIV has been identified just in time to make Moderna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relevant .\nThis particular vaccine candidate , known as IAVI G002 , was developed in conjunction with Scripps Research and the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative ( IAVI ) , and the trial is being partially funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation .\nOn social media and in certain populist corners , the frequency of AIDS mentions has also increased .\nPart of this increase has been fueled by evidence ( both anecdotal and scientific ) that COVID vaccination is harming recipients \u2019 immune systems .\nThe term \u201c VAIDS \u201d ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being used to refer to an ostensible AIDS-like deterioration of the immune system is that is caused not by HIV but by vaccination for COVID .\nAmerica \u2019 s Frontline Doctors state that \u201c Doctors are calling this phenomena in the repeatedly vaccinated \u201c immune erosion \u201d or \u201c acquired immune deficiency \u201d , accounting for elevated incidence of myocarditis and other post-vaccine illnesses that either affect them more rapidly , resulting in death , or more slowly , resulting in chronic illness.\n\u201d This theory rests at least partially on a Lancet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concluded that the level of protection afforded by COVID vaccination decreases over time , eventually even passing the point where the vaccinated are at greater risk than the unvaccinated .\nIncidentally , this is not the first time there has been a connection between COVID and HIV .\nIn December 2020 it was reported that an Australian COVID vaccine candidate was abandoned during trials after some recipients falsely tested positive for HIV .\nThat suggests at least the possibility of a connection between the two things .\nFurther evidence of this possible connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January 2020 published and quickly withdrew a scientific study paper documenting that the SARS-CoV-2 virus contained 4 unique genetic insertions from HIV .\nLuc Montagnier , the French virologist who won the 2008 Nobel Prize in medicine for discovering of HIV , also claimed that SARS-CoV-2 contained insertions from HIV .\nHe had also previously urged caution regarding COVID vaccines , and warned of the danger of antibody-dependent enhancement .\nSadly , by some strange coincidence , Luc Montagnier passed away this week , just at the very time HIV is coming back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was 89 .\nThe essay below from author Karen Hunt provides a further discussion on the \u2018 Resurrection of HIV \u2018 \u2026 \u201c It is an indescribable experience knowing that what you are doing

shift from a government mandate to an individual choice.\n\u201d Wow , did we just hear the words individual choice drop from Wen \u2019 s mouth ?\nThe science can change , that \u2019 s a beauty of it .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key , of course , is in who interprets the changing science for us .\nAnd that person is Dr. Anthony Fauci .\nWhat has not changed during this interlude of falsified freedom is the government \u2019 s ability to do this again .\nAnd again .\nThis bowing down to the will of those above us has been normalized .\nAny time Fauci deems it necessary , for our own good , he can

anywhere anytime soon ?\nEven if they did , they would simply be replaced .\nThose of us looking on from the sidelines with horror have a hard time understanding how most people , and certainly those in high places , are one hundred percent behind this tyranny and are doing all they can to ensure that it continues .\nMind you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its benevolence , that has nothing to do with it .\nThey

will leave behind a legacy as one of the greatest , if not the greatest , medical men in history .\nFauci \u2019 s mentor was a man named Sheldon Wolf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the NIH .\nWolf encouraged Fauci to explore the things he was most curious about .\nThe WSJ article , The Mentor Who Made Dr. Fauci describes how \u201c Fauci chose a rare inflammatory disease with a 100 % fatality rate and went searching for inspiration .\nHe found it two floors away .\nNIH researchers upstairs were testing immunosuppressive drugs on cancers , and Fauci tried experimenting with low doses on his patients .\nIt was highly unorthodox .\nIt was also highly effective .\nThis pioneering use of anti-cancer drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cure .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve always wanted to be involved with diseases that were very , very serious , \u201d Fauci once said .\n\u201c I would rather be involved with patients who have fatal diseases than those with diseases that are just an annoyance .\nThat just happened to be my bent .\nI wanted to be where the action was.\n\u201d It is interesting to note that Fauci had this great success early on by using anti-cancer drugs for a non-cancerous disease and he went on to repeat this with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to later in the essay .\nThis man who started off as an idealistic boy , delivering drugs on his bicycle , who wanted to be \u201c where the action was , \u201d grew and grew beyond his critics , beyond those who dared to challenge him , learning to maneuver his way in and out of controversy , telling himself and then the world , bigger and bigger stories to justify drugs , mountains of drugs representing untold wealth and power , until he stood at the very top of the vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of humanity that he no doubt firmly believed it was his job to save .\nThis medical empire has now grown so big , that when it falls , and surely it will one day for that is the nature of things , that they grow and they die , it will bring down our entire civilization with it .\nSo , think long and hard before calling for its downfall , for what will happen on that day is an apocalypse\u2026a subject for another essay .\nMany have sought to defy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rogan

that be ?\nOld fox that he is , Fauci would never fall for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rogan and his guests are so far beneath Fauci in credibility it would be farcical for him to stoop to their level .\nRogan is a morality tale of what happens to the most defiant of sinners .\nHe must now atone for his sins .\nAnd he has tried to do so .\nHe started with one apology and the floodgates opened .\nHis

back on what I told you about Fauci \u2019 s first big success , \u201c pioneering use of anti-cancer drugs for a non-cancerous disease \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its cure.\n\u201d Burroughs Wellcome took an old cancer drug that hadn \u2019 t worked out very well , AZT , or azidothymidine , and repurposed it for AIDS .\nIn 1987 , Wellcome obtained FDA approval to market the drug , after a rushed and bogus trial .\nBut no matter , this was an emergency , and something was better than nothing .\nThe company called the \u201c new \u201d drug Retrovir and sold it for $ 188 for a hundred 100mg capsules .\nThe price was so high most people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times worse than Wellcome \u2019 s price-gouging were the side effects of AZT , including severe intestinal problems , damage to the immune system , nausea , vomiting and headaches .\nPeople taking AZT soon began showing rising virus levels \u2014 but the virus was no longer the same , having mutated to resist the drug .\nMore drugs were needed .\nMore and more drugs .\nEndlessly more drugs .\nAnd as we now see with drug companies like Pfizer and Moderna , once Burroughs Wellcome \u2019 s drug was approved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spin \u2019 s 2015 article AIDS and the AZT Scandal , big profits ensued : \u201c Stock went through the roof when the announcement was made .\nAt a price of $ 8.000 per patient per year ( not including bloodwork and transfusions ) , AZT is the most expensive drug ever marketed .\nBurroughs Wellcome \u2019 s gross profits for next year are estimated at $ 230 million .\nStock market analysts predict that Burroughs Wellcome may be selling as much as $ 2 billion worth of AZT , under the brand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mid-1990s \u2014 matching Burroughs Wellcome \u2019 s total sales for all its products last year.\n\u201d As now , with people being bullied and fearmongered into taking an experimental gene therapy , Gene Fedorko , President of Health Education AIDS Liaison ( HEAL ) .\nFarber described the same methods used on AIDS patients : \u201c I \u2019 m convinced that if you gave AZT to a perfectly healthy athlete , \u201d says Fedorko , \u201c he would be dead in five years.\n\u201d These words of Fedorko come back to haunt us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to so many athletes who have taken the mRNA vaccines .\nHere is a list of 17 high-level athletes who have collapsed , had heart issues or died .\nThis is just one list , there are many others .\nDeaths matter little when that much money is involved .\nThe flow can not be stopped .\nThe fountainhead , the impetus that keeps it all flowing , is Dr. Fauci .\nAs head of NIAID , Fauci controls more than $ 6 billion in funding for scientific research .\nFor decades , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions on which direction medical research should go .\nWith a yah or a nay , Fauci decides who gets money for what research and who doesn \u2019 t .\nIt is \u201c thanks \u201d to Fauci that Retrovir was funded , just as it was thanks to Fauci that the mRNA vaccines were funded .\nCelia Faber interviewed PCR inventor Kerry Mullis in a Spin 1995 story who had this to say about Fauci and his gang : Going back to why Fauci will never talk to Joe Rogan , we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us in 1995 by Kary Mullis .\nFauci will never allow his carefully crafted facade to slip by exposing himself to the hard questions .\nIn the first chapter of Inventing the AIDS Virus Dr. Peter Duesberg had this to say : It \u2019 s a cutthroat game , hunting viruses .\nCreating this Covid pandemic was the creme de la creme .\nIt has opened the door to more and more drugs , vaccines , implants under our skin , the introduction of a social credit system and so much more .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ are trying to claim , the media has recently been inundating us with warnings about the next virus or variant .\nThe hype is that this surge in acquired immune deficiency is not the drugs , but it has something to do with HIV .\n\u201c We have known what causes acquired immunity deficiency diseases for at least 70 years .\nIt \u2019 s in the medical textbooks .\nIt \u2019 s there for you to read .\n\u2022 Number one cause on the face of this Earth , is malnutrition and starvation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the headlines of the October 3rd issue of the London Times , Sunday Times last year [ 1993 ] .\nAnd inside headlines that screamed across 2 pages \u201c The Plague That Never Was \u201d .\n\u2022 Number two is drugs .\nAnd don \u2019 t just think of street drugs .\nBecause the number one cause of AIDS today is actually TWO medical drugs !\nAZT .\nA drug that was discovered in the 60 \u2019 s as a chemotherapeutic drug for cancer .\nAnd was shelved because it was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse than cancer .\nIs being used to treat people who are immuno-suppressed.\n\u201d \u2022 Number three cause of AIDS is radiation .\nWhether they worry about Chernobyl and Nagasaki and Hiroshima .\nDr. Duesberg warned that \u201c science took a wrong turn \u201d with AIDS .\nDr. Duesberg seemed to believe that the tide would turn .\nThat surely science would redirect itself and become honest again .\nIt did not .\nWe are still on this mad path of chasing viruses ; of being \u201c where the action is.\n\u201d It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public too gullible .\nWhy stop ?\nFauci has told us the story and he is the master storyteller .\nThe majority nods and says , ah , yes , it must be so .\nWhat happens next time ?\nWhat if we are told we must now get vaccinated against HIV ?\nIt doesn \u2019 t have to be that , of course .\nIt could be something else .\nWhat happens if we are ordered to get an mRNA vaccine every year against Covid ?\nAnd against the flu ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ And against the next illness and the next ?\nLike Rogan \u2019 s apology , once billions of people submitted to the first one , it \u2019 s virtually impossible to stop the next , and the next .\nNo matter how cocky or tough , diminutive Fauci will avoid your punches and get you to submit instead .\nModerna is beginning a trial of an mRNA vaccine for HIV .\nThe race is on .\nI can just see those CEOs rubbing their hands together with glee .\nSo much to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made .\nStories are popping up about WHO discovering a highly virulent variant of HIV-1 circulating in the Netherlands .\nBut don \u2019 t worry .\nIt poses no risk to the general public .\nThen why are we seeing stories like this all over the news ?\nWe \u2019 ve learned to look out for such stories ; the ones that MSM repeats across all platforms in an orchestrated fashion .\nIt doesn \u2019 t happen by chance .\nArticles published outside of the accepted narrative are quickly discredited and discarded .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of medical scientists in India in the medical science journal BioRXiv in January 2020 , entitled \u201c Uncanny similarity of unique inserts in the 2019-nCov spike protein to HIV-1 and Gag.\n\u201d In a highly controversial finding , they reported : \u201c We found 4 insertions in the spike glycoprotein ( S ) which are unique to the 2019-nCoV and are not present in other coronaviruses .\nImportantly , amino acid residues in all 4 inserts have identity or similarity to those in the HIV-1 gp120 or HIV-Gag , all of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key structural proteins of HIV-1 is unlikely to be fortuitous in nature.\n\u201d The article almost immediately was withdrawn after \u2018 disinformation experts \u2019 recognized the Indian medical scientists were suggesting that COVID-19 was created by inserting the particular glycoprotein from the HIV-1 disease that involve patents held by or applied for by Fauci .\nEven more upsetting to disinformation operatives was the suggestion that the insertion of these 4 inserts into a SARS virus is not likely to occur in nature .\nThe clear suggestion was that COVID-19 was laboratory-created , possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creator of the virus used GP120 to do so , a glycoprotein from the HIV-1 1990s era that tied back to Fauci.\n\u201d Such \u201c fringe \u201d articles are overshadowed by mainstream articles nudging HIV into people \u2019 s consciousness and encouraging them to get tested for it .\nOne of the oddest examples I have seen was of UK MP Maria Caulfield who put up a video on Twitter during HIV Testing week of her getting an HIV test .\nShe warns her constituents that \u201c Viruses don \u2019 t discriminate \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d encourage anyone who hasn \u2019 t yet to find out your HIV status to help achieve our goal to end HIV transmission in England by 2030.\n\u201d Keep in mind , the PCR test that was used to identify HIV was once again used for Covid\u2014the very test that the inventor Kary Mullis warned us about !\nFauci knew all of this .\nHe knew in the 1980s that the tests were faulty .\nThey all did back then , and they all do now .\nBut they kept on insisting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written so much about tests , and I encourage people not to take them .\nBillions of people are now quite used to the process and think nothing of testing being a part of their daily lives .\nThese tests are bringing us full circle .\nBack to HIV .\nBack to AIDS .\nBack to testing for it .\nLong before Rogan arrived on the scene , a smear campaign was used against Kary Mullis , the crazy inventor of the PCR test .\nIn Celia Farber \u2019 s interview , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forum meeting in New York , a leading AIDS activist , when asked about whether Mullis shouldn \u2019 t be taken seriously , answered that he should not , for he is a \u2018 sexist pig.\n\u2019 This was based on something Mullis allegedly said upon receiving the Nobel prize \u2013 that the prize would be \u201c a great way to pick up babes.\n\u201d I present Mullis with this logic .\n\u201c \u2018 They just want to show that I \u2019 m not politically correct , \u2019 he says .\n\u2018 Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reason is that I already got my money from the Swedes , right ?\nI \u2019 m done , I \u2019 m fixed .\nI \u2019 m a free agent , and it is the most wonderful feeling .\nThere is nobody on the planet that can fuck with me .\nAnd I can say exactly what I feel about any issue and I \u2019 m going to do that.\n\u2019 \u201d I admire Kary Mullis for his honesty .\nI admired Joe Rogan for his honesty .\nHe should have taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days has any hutzpah left ?\nIn Fauci \u2019 s dystopian world of obey the Science or else , Fauci \u2019 s patience is running thin .\nHe has been forgiving and understand for long enough .\nThe anti-vaccination movement must be obliterated before it gains any more momentum .\nFauci recently told Stephanie Ruhle on MSNBC , that the movement was \u201c very disturbing.\n\u201d He wants everyone to know that the size of the anti-vaccination movement in the US is being \u201c underestimated.\n\u201d And that he is being \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him and his family .\nYes , yes , of course it \u2019 s been stressful for him and his family , but he assures us that his work is \u201c too important \u201d for him to back down .\nWhen Kentucky Senator Rand Paul dared question him , Fauci complained , \u201c What happens when [ Paul ] gets out and accuses me of things that are completely untrue is that it kindles the crazies out there and I have threats upon my life , harassment of my family and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are lying about me.\n\u201d Fauci fails to recall that Rand Paul is an actual victim of violence .\nHe and his wife were attacked by a mob of Black Lives Matter protestors outside of the 2020 Republican National Convention .\nMrs. Paul took issue with some media coverage saying activists \u201c confronted \u201d her and her husband when she retorted : \u201c No @ politico , we were not \u2018 confronted \u2019 by protestors .\nWe were circled by a hateful mob shouting vile expletives , preventing us from moving .\nBeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is violence.\n\u201d Fauci \u2019 s wife is frightened by the threats against her family and rightly so .\nI am sure , however , when talking about her safety concerns , neither she nor Fauci gets the irony : \u201c I don \u2019 t understand the hate that people have , and the hate that leads them to do something that could hurt somebody or kill somebody .\nIt sort of reduces my trust in humanity.\n\u201d What could possibly lead anyone to hurt or kill somebody else ?\nI don \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s wife has her own stories she tells herself , just as her husband does , just as we all do .\nI am sure she believes that she and her husband are the victims here , not the millions of people whose lives have been destroyed by Fauci \u2019 s policies and the drugs he has forced upon them .\nThe Faucis could not smile so happily at family gatherings otherwise .\nRecently Sen. Ron Johnson moderated a panel discussion , COVID-19 : A Second Opinion , where \u201c a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different perspective on the global pandemic response , the current state of knowledge of early and hospital treatment , vaccine efficacy and safety , what went right , what went wrong , what should be done now , and what needs to be addressed long term.\n\u201d \u2022 Substantial Data Showing Miscarriages increased by over 279 % since the Covid-19 vaccine .\nThe data was compared to a 5 year average of miscarriages .\n\u2022 Substantial Data Showing Cancers increased by over 296 % over the 5 year average .\n\u2022 * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vaccine ( which would impact our pilots . )\nThe Whistleblower DOD data shows a 1048 % increase .\nNeurological Cases went from 82K a year to 863K in just 1 year\u2026the year of the Covid-19 vaccine .\n\u2022 * Whistleblower data shows U.S. Military are being experimented on , injured , and in some cases possibly killed .\n\u2022 *Allegations of doctored Department of Defense data on the number of cases of myocarditis .\nLast August myocarditis cases were up 20+ % .\nThe number in Jan. 2022 now only shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Project Salus says that the 71 % of new cases were in the vaccinated and a 60 % of hospitalizations comes from fully vaccinated people .\nNot the unvaccinated as Fauci stated on Television multiple times .\n( The DOD removed this data from their once public website when Renz first revealed it last year .\nWe have screenshots at www.Renz-Law.com ) Just as doctors and scientists spoke out in the 1980s about HIV-AIDS\u2014that the cure was causing the disease , they are speaking out now .\nHow could Fauci and his policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is \u201c for the protection of the individual , of their family and of society ?\n\u201d One of my favorite bad guys in literature is Count Fosco from Wilkie Collins \u2019 masterpiece , The Woman in White .\nFosco is an Italian spy who is out to steal the fortune of an innocent young woman .\nTo all outward appearances , Fosco is charming , charismatic and so sensitive he wouldn \u2019 t hurt a fly .\nOn the inside , he is a murdering monster who takes delight in controlling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Count Fosco has a talent for \u201c taming \u201d wild creatures\u2014he keeps a family of white mice and several birds that he has proudly gotten to do his bidding .\nHe has \u201c tamed \u201d his wife , Madame Fosco , who used to be an independent , outspoken woman and who is now an obedient servant to her husband and bases her every opinion on his advice .\nCount Fosco really gets off on his power and so does Dr. Fauci .\nWe are Fauci \u2019 s mice .\nAnd yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has managed to turn it all around so that he is the victim , and the mice who object to being put into cages and experimented on are his abusers .\nThere are heroes who are standing up .\nI have quoted from Members of the European Parliament Cristian Terhes , Christine Anderson and Ivan Vilibor Sincic .\nMislav Kolakusic , MEP of Serbia , is one more who speaks fearlessly , a warrior for freedom .\nIn one speech , he talks directly to Ursula von der Leyen , President of the @ @

conducted on more than 500 million people in the European Union .\nIt is the right of every citizen to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own lives .\nWe have trampled on several centuries of science and the medical profession .\nWe are now introducing measures that have no end in sight.\n\u201d I keep quoting these MEPs because they know what they are talking about .\nIt wasn \u2019 t long ago that their countries were overrun by armies , they have experienced Nazism first-hand .\nThe iron fist of communism .\nDr. Anthony Fauci and his Mafioso gang have built a medical empire of tyranny the likes of which the world has never known .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quite the contrary .\nYet within that empire there are countless decent , ordinary people who want freedom and will surely fight for it to the end

the mainstream corporate approach to the HIV and AIDS \u2018 crisis \u2019 , and started questioning many of the establishment \u2019 s assumptions on the treatment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Anthony Fauci and others constructed around the dubious HIV/AIDS \u2018 epidemic \u2019 .\nHe ended up positing some controversial views on COVID , variants and vaccines , and in January of this year told the

) .\nBy Patrick Henningsen for New Dawn Magazine We knew the world was changing in radical ways , but we never thought it would happen this fast .\nIn 2015 , I penned a feature article for this publication entitled \u201c Oceania Forever : Rise of the Global Police State.\n\u201d After closely following the steady construction of a global control grid after 9/11 , it was still difficult to see exactly where it was all going and why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructure would be permanent , and there was undoubtedly some speculation of an emerging supranational global government , but still no clear endgame in sight .\nAll that changed in 2020 , and many of my previous questions were answered .\nWith the advent of the global pandemic , the global police state had finally received its marching orders .\nNearly a year later , in 2016 , I wrote a follow-up piece in an attempt to visualise what an emerging technocracy might look and feel like \u2013 the shape of things to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of arch globalist Zbigniew Brzezinski .\nThat article , \u201c Technetronic Enslavement : Life Inside the Matrix of Control , \u201d was published in New Dawn 156 ( May-June 2016 ) .\nSince then , my suspicions have been validated and questions answered through the emergence of the globalists \u2019 Great Reset agenda .\nSo here we are , a full eighteen months down the road of the Great Plague , and looking around we now see what life is like inside a New World Order .\nNo one expected it would come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale .\nThe shock and awe also signalled the beginning of what looks more and more like a post-democratic era \u2013 the ascendency of global fascism with cold technocratic features , orchestrated by an elite cabal of rapacious oligarchs , and remorseless bureaucrats taking their instructions from shadowy cliques of science advisors governing every conceivable aspect of our daily lives\u2026 right down to where we are allowed to travel , if we are allowed to work , what we can buy , whether our children can attend school , and even who we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of control even extends to the mandating of masks and what experimental injections we are expected to receive in order to \u2018 win back our freedoms \u2019 and return to normal life .\nWe \u2019 re told by our leaders that all of this is necessary and permanent , and that it \u2019 s for our safety , and the

\u2019 s no rest for the wicked.\n\u201d That \u2019 s certainly the case with vaccine mogul Bill Gates .\nAs the world finally gets an opportunity to take a breath \u2013 after being suffocated by two years of pandemic theatre and 24/7 government and corporate pharmaceutical propaganda , the notorious architect of the global COVID-19 \u2018 vaccine \u2019 roll-out , billionaire tech monopolist turned pharmaceutical scion , Bill Gates , is still determined to realize his life \u2019 s ambition of achieving 100 % global vaccine compliance .\nTo keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadows this week to prepare the public for \u201c the next pandemic.\n\u201d Bill Gates said Friday that the risks of severe disease from Covid-19 have \u201c dramatically reduced \u201d but another pandemic is all but certain .\nSpeaking to CNBC \u2019 s Hadley Gamble at Germany \u2019 s annual Munich Security Conference , Gates , co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , said that a potential new pandemic would likely stem from a different pathogen to that of the coronavirus family .\nBut he added that advances in medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better job of fighting it \u2014 if investments are made now .\n\u201c We \u2019 ll have another pandemic .\nIt will be a different pathogen next time , \u201d Gates said .\nInitially , Gates had been actively promoting each and every \u2018 variant \u2019 \u2013 constantly talking-up the crisis in order to help maintain the perception of a constant demand for the highly controversial experimental COVID-19 \u2018 vaccine \u2019 gene-jabs .\nThis includes the most recent media creation known as the \u201c Omicron \u201d variant .\nBut as the public began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the media gradually began to abandon the Omicron narrative .\nGates has clearly read the propaganda tea leaves , and has since started backtracking from some of his previous positions \u2013 and is even admitting that natural immunity is more effective than the dubious pharmaceutical-based synthetic immunity he \u2019 s been pushing for the last two years through the media and his proxy organizations the World Health Organization ( WHO ) and the GAVI vaccine alliance .\nTwo years into the coronavirus pandemic , Gates said the worst effects have faded as huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some level of immunity .\nIts severity has also waned with the latest omicron variant .\nHowever , Gates said that in many places that was due to virus itself , which creates a level of immunity , and has \u201c done a better job of getting out to the world population than we have with vaccines.\n\u201d In order to further shield him from an increasing public backlash for his role in shamelessly promoting the \u2018 global pandemic \u2019 and vaccine narratives , Gates has also carefully admitted the existence of comorbidities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the vaccine kingpin is still lamenting his failure to reach 70 % \u2018 penetration \u2019 of the experimental mRNA toxic injections into the arms of the global population .\nGates said it was already \u201c too late \u201d to reach the World Health Organization \u2019 s goal to vaccinate 70 % of the global population by mid-2022 .\nCurrently , 61.9 % of the world population has received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine .\nHe added that the world should move faster in the future to develop and distribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now .\n\u201c Next time we should try and make it , instead of two years , we should make it more like six months , \u201d Gates said , adding that standardized platforms , including messenger RNA ( mRNA ) technology , would make that possible .\nIt \u2019 s important for people to realize that Gates and his network are not finished in their plan to establish a global conveyor belt for experimental gene-based pharmaceutical injections \u2013 and he is already eyeing \u2018 the next pandemic \u2019 in order to roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agenda .\nThere is no shortage of funds either : \u201c The cost of being ready for the next pandemic is not that large .\nIt \u2019 s not like climate change .\nIf we \u2019 re rational , yes , the next time we \u2019 ll catch it early.\n\u201d Gates , through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , has partnered with the U.K. \u2019 s Wellcome Trust to donate $ 300 million to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations , which helped form the Covax program to deliver vaccines to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is aiming to raise $ 3.5 billion in an effort cut the time required to develop a new vaccine to just 100 days .\nIt \u2019 s no coincidence either that Gates has just begun marketing his latest manifesto entitled , How to Prevent the Next Pandemic .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve been following COVID since the early days of the outbreak , working with experts from inside and out of the Gates Foundation who are championing a more equitable response and have been fighting infectious diseases for decades .\nI \u2019 ve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this pandemic and how we stop the next one\u2014and I want to share what I \u2019 ve heard with people .\nSo , I started writing a book about how we can make sure that no one suffers through a pandemic ever again.\n\u201d To mark the occasion , Gates released this disturbing propaganda video \u2013 littered with many of the staged images and government tropes used to reinforce the COVID \u2018 global pandemic \u2019 crisis narrative since the winter of 2020 .\nWatch : PLEASE HELP SUPPORT OUR INDEPENDENT MEDIA PLATFORM HERE", "author": "NEWS WIRE", "url":

we dare to express doubt about vaccine efficacy , or raise concerns for safety , we are sharply rebutted and reminded of smallpox as a solid testament to the power of immunisation to combat disease .\nFor generations , we have been conditioned to believe that smallpox is a highly contagious , indiscriminate , and deadly virus \u2014 that it killed many millions worldwide , and that we were only saved from its ghastly ravages by the development of vaccinations .\nHowever , upon closer examination , this popular narrative is belied by the facts and historical reporting .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be the result of modern medical propaganda .\nThere is another story : that vaccines did not eradicate smallpox , but actually made the problem worse .\nLike many other diseases , cases were already decreasing by the time vaccinations were introduced , but then began to rise again with the rollout of mass immunisation .\nSmallpox was at its peak during the 1700s , though it was often confused and conflated with other illnesses with similar symptoms , including chicken pox , measles , shingles , scarlet fever , and secondary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a somewhat fabled disease , but in days gone by it was regarded as a lethal , everyday scourge that you would be considered lucky to avoid .\nAnxiously accepted as an unpleasant part of life , some chose to purposefully infect themselves to get it over with , or as an attempt to reduce intensity of symptoms .\nThis \u2018 arm-to-arm \u2019 ( or up the nose ) transfer of a biological sample was known as variolation and involved matter from an infected pustule being blown up the nose or pricked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a risky procedure because there was always a chance of catching some other infection or disease , which could also lead to death .\nIn 1796 , historical golden boy , Edward Jenner , often referred to as \u201c the father of immunology , \u201d began experimenting on cows after hearing a local farmer had apparently gained smallpox immunity by inoculating himself with cowpox secretions .\nJenner hypothesised that because cows didn \u2019 t carry the same transmissible diseases as humans they would be safer to use as donors for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the method .\nEight-year-old James Phipps was one of the first to be immunised by Jenner ; by the time he died at the age of 20 he had been vaccinated over 20 times .\nJenner also tested the vaccine on his own son , who became crippled and died at 21 .\nBoth men died of tuberculosis , which some researchers attribute to the smallpox vaccine ( Eleanor McBean , The Poisoned Needle ) .\nSEE ALSO : Bill Gates is Ready to Capitalize on \u2018 The Next Pandemic \u2019 Though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Hunter , Jenner sat no examinations and purchased a \u00a315 medical degree from St. Andrews University only after he had been practicing for twenty years .\nHis opponents considered him vain , petulant , crafty , and greedy \u2014 a \u2018 self-deluded quack \u2019 who omitted vital information and denounced his own findings only to reassert them when it suited him.Nevertheless , he managed to persuade the influential elites of his convictions and received a

England .\nBefore this , the two-year death rate from the disease was 2,000 , whereas eighteen years later , during the pandemic of 1871 , it had reached 44,800 .\nIt is estimated that 90 % of those who fell ill had been vaccinated .\nOpposition to vaccination grew stronger , as the situation got worse , not better .\nLeicester was an important hub of activism through anti-vaccination leagues and societies formed throughout the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rights of citizens and communities stood together to fight government tyranny .\nRegular protests took place and dedicated teams produced and distributed pamphlets and flyers with titles such as : Vaccination : Its Fallacies and Evils , Vaccination : a Curse , and Horrors of Vaccination .\nHuge numbers of people across the land worried that the vaccine was unsafe and unproven .\nParents were fined and thrown in prison for refusing to immunise their children , but their commitment to the cause didn \u2019 t waver .\nThrough fierce , persistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed an act in 1898 that removed penalties and allowed parents to choose whether to have their children vaccinated .\nAlfred Russell Wallace , a naturalist and biologist , charted European deaths from smallpox and the vaccine and reported that : The real problem with smallpox was filth and lack of hygiene .\nSir Edwin Chadwick , a social reformer , toured populous working class areas of England and produced the 1842 Sanitary Report , which compelled councils to provide better facilities .\nHe said : The construction of London \u2019 s sewers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed by the mid-1860s , and sanitation and health throughout the country continued to improve with the introduction of the Public Health Act in 1875 , which laid out detailed plans for more effective drainage , clearance of waste and rubbish , and regular maintenance of sewers .\nNatural hygienist and physician Dr. Russell T. Trall considered smallpox , \u2018 essentially \u2026 not a dangerous disease \u2019 , and Joel Uritsky , director of the National Immunization Program and Early Smallpox Response and Planning at the CDC , stated more recently that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not highly contagious.\n\u201d H Valentine Knaggs , a physician and naturopath , somewhat radically claimed that smallpox was a beneficent disease : a healing crisis .\nHe said : The body is ridding itself of toxins .\nMedical intervention interferes with the process .\nSmallpox is an outbreak of carbuncles , simultaneously , all over the body .\nIn a natural world , those who survived would be healthy , full of vitality and have great immunity from future disease.\n\u201d In her eponymous essay on smallpox , Dr. Vivian Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been resorted to in the beginning of smallpox \u2026 no complications would have occurred and there would rarely be a genuine pustule.\n\u2019 Back in those days patients were kept in bed , in warm rooms , with dirty blankets and closed windows .\nDoctors applied gauze that had been soaked in corrosive mercuric chloride or carbolic acid and tightly bound the dressings ; white blood cells were destroyed ; the pus couldn \u2019 t escape ; toxicity increased and a second fever inevitably followed .\nIt would seem that medical intervention did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it .\nA doctor at the time remarked : \u201c As it is palpable to all the world how fatal smallpox proves to many of all ages , so it is clear to me from all the observations that I can possibly make , that if no mischief be done , either by physician or nurse , it is the most safe and slight of all diseases.\n\u201d As is often the case , a deeper look at history raises important questions , ones which may challenge many present-day assumptions regarding medicine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 The Origin of Smallpox \u2019 by Walter S.

might even say that our support for peace is toxic .\nBut what is there to lose ?\nWe are demonised , harassed and persecuted already .\nAnd nobody else is interested in making peace , only in pouring

officials in Kiev and Lviv who still openly brandish Nazi symbols and lionize Hitler \u2019 s Waffen SS .\nThis racism was on full display this week , as Ukrainian and Polish security forces pushed backed Africans queuing to flee the war zone and seek safety in neighbouring Poland and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black Africans have been forced to wait at border crossings , and have even received threats of violence from local Ukrainians who don \u2019 t believe blacks should enter the EU before any white Ukrainian .\nIn one incident , a Nigerian family were asked to give up their seats on a cross-border bus out of Ukraine , with the driver and military officers using the phrase \u2018 no blacks \u2019 to deny them access .\nThese incidents have laid bare the systemic cultural bigotry which still dominates large enclaves in Ukrainian politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , certain lives matter more than others ( Image Source ) Black lives matter , except on the Polish-Ukraine border .\nIn a blatant show of racism , African students fleeing the fighting in Ukraine were refused entry into Poland because of the color of their skin .\nIt would appear that Europe might be western and a liberal democracy , but they also have a serious problem with racism .\nNigerian President Muhammadu Buhari has called on Poland to let in all people who are trying to flee Ukraine , saying they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage under U.N. convention , and the color of their passport or their skin should make no difference.\n\u201d Emily , a 24-year-old medical student from Kenya , told the Guardian that she was able to reach

that Polish border staff told him they were \u201c not tending to Africans.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and told us that Blacks were not allowed .\nBut we could see White people going through , \u201d said

all human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not discriminate against us because of the colour of our skin.\n\u201d How people look , the color of their skin and hair , as well as the language they speak , and where their grandparents came from are all sources of racism , and the western liberal media has a problem with racism as well .\nOn Saturday , David Sakvarelidze , Ukraine \u2019 s former deputy

Europe .\nRussian President Putin has accused Ukraine of Genocide in the Donbas region .\nJust days before Putin gave the order to enter Ukraine the new German leader Olaf Scholz stated publically

Mark Curtis , writing for the website Declassified UK , disclosed that the National Endowment for Democracy ( NED ) , a nonprofit corporation funded by the U.S. Congress , had ploughed more than 2.6 million pounds into seven independent British media groups over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups included openDemocracy , the Media Legal Defence Intiative , Thompson Reuters and Bellingcat\u2014which is known for promoting disinformation lending support for regime-change operations in countries such as Russia and Syria .\nThough supporting the work of the Jimmy Carter Center to secure fair and transparent elections , the NED has been involved since its founding in 1983 in trying to undermine or remove governments independent of Washington , including democratic ones in Bolivia , Ecuador and Venezu ela

instructions secretly and so forth , they have now a sidekick , which is this National Endowment for Democracy , NED.\n\u201d This assessment was confirmed by Allen Weinstein , the director of the research study that led to creation of the NED in the 1980s , who remarked in 1991 : \u201c A lot of what we do today was done covertly 25 years ago by the CIA .\nThe biggest difference is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flap potential is close to zero .\nOpenness is its own protection.\n\u201d A ProPublica video report put it even more bluntly : \u201c The National Endowment for Democracy was established by Congress , in effect , to take over the CIA \u2019 s covert propaganda efforts.\n\u201d These propaganda efforts appear to have extended to the U.S. itself , where the NED has received largely favorable publicity\u2014if its activities are covered at all .\nThe media blackout has extended to many alternative media outlets , which fail to disclose the NED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis article provides an overview of NED \u2019 s history and discussion of its wide reach .\nThe NED is a vital component of the U.S. empire , whose emphasis on advancing human rights and democracy helps provide a liberal veneer to imperialistic policies .\nNoam Chomsky wrote that the true agenda of the NED was to \u201c impose what is called democracy , meaning rule by the rich and the powerful , without interference by the mob , but within the framework of formal electoral procedure.\n\u201d Jonah Gindin and Kirsten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may at times ally with movements and individuals genuinely dedicated to democratizing their countries ; however , it \u201c sets the parameters of debate by positioning a particular definition of pro-market , representative democracy as the only antiauthoritarian option ,

to the crisis over Ukraine.\n\u201d This is exactly how Hollywood and the US government have framed war and foreign policy for the last 50 years .\nIt all began with British writer and former intelligence operative , Ian Flemming , author of the highly successful James Bond 007 series , later spun into the successful global franchise of blockbuster films and merchandise .\nWhat the Bond franchise achieved was a subtle reprogramming of the western mind , thereby preparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 humanitarian interventions.\n\u2019 This was done by gradually inculcating the personification of evil as it relates to international affairs and geopolitics \u2013 where all of the world \u2019 s woes could be reduced down to the dictatorial machinations of a single individual \u2013 a mad man .\nAnd to stop him , all of our military , intelligence , and financial assets must be mobilsed to halt his wanton designs of global domination and destruction of \u2018 our way of life.\n\u2019 Sound familiar ?\nThe script treatment is a familiar one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fate of the world , a seamless avatar whose name would change from story to story ; Goldfinger , Blofeld , and Dr No , to name only a few .\nHollywood would also produce countless movies and TV programs using this same character and plot format .\nDecades of conditioning had established this narrow psychological device as the natural framework for how the Anglo sphere and its budding new post Cold War political economy would view world events \u2013 through the lens of a tightly controlled corporate mainstream media .\nSaddam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Assad , Kim , Noriega , and now Putin \u2013 these are objects of our collective fear and free-floating anxiety , as identified by western government leaders and their media and social media information mills .\nIn a matter of hours , any world leader can be transformed into the virtual reincarnation of Adolph Hitler .\nThis phenomenon might also be described as the Hitlerization of western regime change targets \u2013 a deft mainstream public relations feat that was even achieved with a sitting US President , Donald J. Trump .\nTo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understatement .\nFor the western world , this is now a bona fide cultural set-piece .\nThe mainstream clarion call is always the same : \u201c We , the free nations of the world , must all band together to stop this madman before he blows us all up !\n\u201d This process is used to trigger mass formation psychosis , and to quickly get the general public on board with the latest war de jour .\nSome things never go out of style \u2013 or so it seems\u2026 .\nHow convenient for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defies the West \u2019 s projection of power , the western media can agree on one thing : that the foreign government in question is led by a madman , a psychopath or a megalomaniac .\nAt a drop of a hat , western leaders are absolved of guilt or even responsibility for the terrible events that unfold .\nThe West remains virtuous , simply a victim of the world \u2019 s madmen .\nNothing the West did was a provocation .\nNothing they could have done would have averted the disaster .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ state on the planet by far , but its hands are apparently always tied by a deranged , implacable foe like Russia \u2019 s Vladimir Putin .\nPutin , we are told , is not advancing any rational \u2013 from his perspective \u2013 geopolitical or strategic interest by invading his neighbour , Ukraine .\nAnd so no concession could or should have been made because none would have prevented him from acting as he has .\nThe West , meaning foreign policy hawks in Washington , gets to decide when the timeline of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred .\nThe compliant western media give their blessing , and our hands are washed clean once again .\nThe subtext \u2013 always the subtext \u2013 is that something must be done to stop the \u201c madman \u201d .\nAnd because he is irrational and a megalomaniac , such action must never be framed in terms of concessions or compromise \u2013 that would be appeasement , after all .\nIf every enemy is a new Hitler , no western leader will risk a comparison with Neville Chamberlain .\nInstead , what is needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the projection \u2013 whether overtly or covertly \u2013 of yet more western power and force .\nThe US and British invasion of Iraq nearly two decades ago is a particularly pertinent and telling counterpoint to events in Ukraine .\nThen , as now , the West was supposedly faced with a dangerous , irrational ruler who could not be made to see sense and was unwilling to compromise .\nSaddam Hussein , western leaders and their media insisted , had allied with his arch-enemies in al-Qaeda , the perpetrators of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had weapons of mass destruction , and could launch them towards Europe in 45 minutes .\nExcept , none of that was true \u2013 not even the madman bit .\nSaddam was a hard , cold , calculating dictator who , like most dictators , kept himself in power through a reign of terror over his opponents .\nNonetheless , the western media faithfully amplified the tissue of evidence-free claims \u2013 and patent lies like that preposterous alliance with al-Qaeda \u2013 concocted in Washington and London to usher in the illegal 2003 invasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find no trace of stockpiles of Iraq \u2019 s former biological and chemical weapons arsenal .\nOne , Scott Ritter , went unheard as he warned that any possessed by Saddam would have turned to \u201c harmless goo \u201d after many years of sanctions and inspections .\nThe improbable 45-minute claim , meanwhile , was not based on any kind of intelligence .\nIt was lifted straight from a student \u2019 s speculations in a doctoral dissertation .\nIraq \u2019 s invasion by the US and Britain was not only illegal , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It led to the likely deaths of around a million Iraqis

The War on Donbass: Why We Must All Stand Against Fascism", "content": "IMAGE : US and NATO-backed Neo Nazis adorning their provocative radical nationalist symbols , march through the streets of Ukrainian cities .\nFra Hughes 21st Century Wire For those who claim President Putin is a megalomaniac sociopath intent on drawing Europa and America into some kind of Machiavellian war in order to massage his over-inflated ego , let \u2019 s look at the facts shall we ?\nOver the past 8 years , Putin and Russia have avoided a conflict with Ukraine , and by extension the EU , America and NATO , through his refusal to formally intervene or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or indeed , to formally acknowledge them as independent states .\nHe allowed the Minsk Agreements I & II from 2014 and 2015 to form the basis of negotiations between the Lugansk Peoples Republic , the Donetsk Peoples Republic , and the regime in Ukraine .\nMoreover , Russia also received a mandate for the realization of the Minsk peace process from the UN Security Council through Resolution 2202 .\nFor over 7 years , the regime in Kiev , to include the infamous fascist Azov pro neo-Nazi , nationalist Ukrainian armed forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agreements by shelling the independent Republics with prohibited military munitions , causing incredible death and destruction along the way .\nPresident Zelensky , who is being courted by the West , took things further when he escalated tensions and violence on the line of contact and prepared in February this year , for up to 120,000 Ukrainian soldiers to invade and reoccupy the Donbass region .\nHe stated publicly he wanted Ukraine to become a nuclear power .\nPutin had only a few choices : 1 .\nAllow Kiev to retake the Donbass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationalists on its border .\n2 .\nRecognise the two independent Republics and send troops to protect them 3 .\nRecognise the two independent Republics followed by a limited incursion into Ukraine to disarm the fascists and save Europe from another war by eliminating the current Nazi threat today .\nPutin has prevented that from happening again .\nHere is the background you will not read or hear on western warmongering media like the BBC .\nVictoria Nuland bragged in 2014 how the US spent $ 5 billion creating the circumstances that led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Kiev \u2013 toppling the democratically elected President .\nThe Maidan Square protests were organised by pro-western anti-Russian Ukrainian nationalists and fascists who used guns and violence to depose the government , and orchestrate an anti democratic illegal takeover of power which was handed to the fascist descendants of the pro-Nazi Bandera ideologists who fought alongside the Waffen SS in the Second World War .\nMany western readers are still unaware that some 27 million Russians died defeating the Nazis in what become known as \u201c The Great Patriotic War \u201d .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a group of anti Nazi teenagers called the Young Guard were active in resisting the German fascist occupation of Ukraine .\nWeeks before the Red Army liberated Lugansk , in January 1943 , the Gestapo kidnaped the Young Guard which had up to 80 members , torturing and beating them .\nThey threw some of the Young Guard while still alive down a mine shaft .\nBoulders were then dropped onto those who had survived the fall until their cries of pain subsided .\nThis is just one of the memories the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fascism .\nA museum to honour the heroism of the anti-fascist Young Guard can be found in Lugansk today .\nThat is why they denounced the illegal American financed coup of 2014 and refused to live under an undemocratic fascist installed coup .\nI have visited the mine and I have shown my respect to those who were first tortured , beaten and then systematically murdered .\nI understand how the murder of Russian speaking trade unionists and others who were forced to seek refuge in the trade Union building in Odessa on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocked the fire escape routes and systematically burned the building down , murdering men women and children many of whom had been physicality assaulted \u2013 has had a profound effect upon the Donbass and people across Ukraine , and the world .\nThe people of the Lugansk oblast , the Donetsk oblast , and the Crimea , exercised their inalienable right not be forced to live under an illegal coup .\nThe people with no army , no air force and no navy , much like the Palestinians , chose the path of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the occupying tanks and when the people were murdered by their own army , then they turned to armed resistance I have seen the mass graves were so many civilians had died , with the morgue full , the people were laid to rest together .\nI have spoken with their family .\nI was told the stories how Ukrainian snipers shot men women and children who went to the river to draw water as all drinkable water was contaminated .\nIt was either die of thirst of risk drawing water in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberation saw a portion of the Donbass breakaway from the fascist controlled Ukraine government and set up two autonomous regions .\nCrimea held a referendum where the people voted to join the Russian Federation and both Lugansk and Donetsk held elections were the people voted to support independence and the Republics of Lugansk and Donetsk were born .\nIn 2014 the Minsk Protocol Agreements saw an acceptance by the government in Ukraine that both new Republics would be viewed as autonomous regions.That a ceasefire would be introduced .\nLarge calibre munitions such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defacto peace , which was periodically broken by Ukrainian artillery attacks on Donetsk was largely observed .\nThe OSCE the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe was positioned to monitor the ceasefires .\nDuring Donald Trump \u2019 s Presidency there was no American focus on the Ukraine .\nHis America first policy and the new enemy they were creating , the \u2018 Yellow Peril \u2019 of China with its growing economic global dominance , meant there was no real American destabilisation of the Donbass/Ukraine ceasefire .\nThere was relative peace in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear Armageddon war against Russia is being openly promoted and debated by US officials .\nBiden was vice president to Obama and Victoria Nuland \u2019 s boss in 2014 during the Maidan Square pro EU fascist coup .\nPresident George HW Bush , a Republican , bombed Saddam Hussein \u2019 s Iraq army out of Kuwait .\nHe is rumoured to have said he should have finished the job during the first Gulf War .\nEnter George Bush Jr , also a Republican President , who was following in his father \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , set in motion his father \u2019 s plan to finish off Saddam .\nThe untruth of weapons of mass destruction was invented and alongside Tony Blair they both lied and led us into an illegal war .\nAre we witnessing history repeating itself , yet again ?\nBiden comes to power , Russia is the new , old enemy .\nIs he finishing the outstanding business of 2014 , when they allowed 2 million people escape the clutches of the fascist coup ?\nBiden may appear to be a weak senile mumbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when it beats , is a cold calculating politician devoid of empathy or humanity .\nAfter initially pouring 90 tons of \u2018 lethal aid \u2019 , weapons of mass destruction into Ukraine and billions of dollars in continued support .\nThe Ukraine now bolstered with EU British and NATO support feels strong enough to reoccupy the separatist areas of Donbass .\nAnd this is exactly what happened in the lead up to Russia moving into Ukraine .\nA local militia of lightly armed men 18-55 are all that stands in the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kiev , made in the image of the Bandera supporting Waffen SS Nazi era from occupying Donbass .\nFascism is on the rise all over Europe .\nNationalism is being encouraged to foment anti Russian sentiment .\nWe are back in the 1930 \u2019 s with NATO , the new alliance , not against fascism \u2013 which they are openly supporting , but against mother Russia .\nDuring the Cold War the fight was against communist Russia and the Soviet Union .\nThe Soviet Union no longer exists thanks to Gorbachev and Yeltsin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millionaires just like most other European countries and America .\nIt has a capitalist driven economy and a capitalist ruling class .\nWhere is the profit to be found in the Ukraine-Donbass-Russian conflict ?\nRussia has built a gas pipeline in conjunction with Germany , to supply cheap energy to Europe .\nThe Nordstream2 pipeline will deliver billions of cubic metres of gas from the Russian gas fields to Central Europe and Britain .\nThis is a win-win for Russia and Europe .\nRussia exports gas at a profit , Europe imports cheaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for US and other LNG imports from suppliers on the open market .\nThe new pipeline will bypass Ukraine , a country which already relies on Russian gas supplies to keep its homes warm and the fires of industry burning .\nAmerica is hoping to supply more of Europe \u2019 s energy requirements than Russia .\nAmerica is currently the biggest oil producer in the world ahead of both Saudi Arabia and Russia .\nShale gas extracted via the disputed fracking process is being transported to Europe in the form of liquefied natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas is only extracted when the price of gas is high making the venture economically viable .\nAmerica gas companies need the price of gas to remain artificially high in order to make a profit .\nThe American administration and President Biden have long been cajoling the German Chancellor and the German government to abandon the Nordstream2 project and impose sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine/Donbass issue .\nIf we add the weapons sales to Ukraine from America , to the profits that engorge American energy sales to Europe , with the now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial support of Ukraine with billion dollar loans from western financiers , global capitalists and the banks I think we can clearly see what is really at stake in Donbass .\nBillions of dollars of profit for shareholders is to be made from selling American gas to Europe indefinitely Billions of dollars is to be made by shareholders from selling weapons of mass destruction to Ukraine and possibly other former Soviet Union nations now in NATO , indefinitely Billions of dollars of profit for shareholders is to be made from selling financial services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFor America the war in Donbass is no more than a vehicle to create profit with the bonus of further marginalising and isolating Russia in a continued economic war of global dominance .\nWashington \u2019 s plan : Russian capitalists in charge of stealing the wealth of the Russian people are to be replaced by American capitalists who want to steal the wealth of the Russian people in their place .\nOn one level , everything we witness is a fight between the capitalist classes of many nations fighting over the resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superiority through military and financial destabilisation .\nYet the people of Lugansk , Donetsk , and Crimea have the right not to live under an imposed fascist coup .\nThey have democratically elected leaders in place , mandated by the people .\nThey are Russian-speaking citizens with long cultural , historical , economic , and family ties to Russia .\nShould the fascists in Ukraine launch an all out invasion of Donbass , we must stand with the people of the region in the face of a resurgent western armed and financed fascist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia into the conflict in order to impose sanctions and scrap the Nordstream2 pipeline .\nSay no to capitalist wars of aggression Say no to wars for

are still wearing their masks in the street and that number more than doubles in shops and supermarkets .\nWhy are so many people ignoring the rules and ignoring the danger to their own health ?\nI

masks that match their outfit and they \u2019 d feel improperly dressed without a mask on .\nBut I think the majority of them are virtue signalling numpties .\n\u2018 Look at me , I \u2019 m such a good person that I \u2019 m wearing a mask even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to.\n\u2019 You can see it in their eyes : the superciliousness ; the sense of moral superiority .\nIt started with recycling

@ @ @ @ electric car makes them look like good people .\nIf they could read and had the brains of a pea they \u2019 d know that electric cars are worse for the environment than diesel and petrol driven cars .\nAnd they should know ( but probably don \u2019 t ) that the electricity that drives their tin can is produced by burning Russian gas and bits of chopped up tree .\nNow , the obedient , virtue signalling numpties are wearing little ribbons to show that they support Ukraine and hate Russia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxes with tins and packets of almost out of date food , that they \u2019 ve decided they don \u2019 t like , and taking their boxes along to special centres in the vain and stupid belief that their goodies will stop the war .\nDo they have any idea how much it would cost to

country they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governments to stop buying Russian oil , gas , wheat and metals .\nIsn \u2019 t that racism ?\nDid the virtue signalling numpties behave this way during any one of the other

Russia \u2013 Hysteria and the Next Horseman of The Apocalypse", "content": "Again , Russophobes , germophobes , it \u2019 s all the same\u2026 How seamlessly we have moved from war with covid , to war with Russia .\nBut how , by what process has this happened , and why ?\nWhat , if they exist , are the links between these two totally different enemies ?\nThe how is relatively easy to define .\nThe narrative \u2013 everything in these mediatised days is about the narrative \u2013 is much the same in each case .\nA dreadful scourge of mankind ( the coronavirus , Russia ) suddenly emerges out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelmed , clueless how to respond but under huge pressure from media and public to \u2018 do something \u2019 , flail about , alighting on draconian measures ( lockdowns , sanctions ) which make everybody feel good about themselves but do nothing to solve the problem and boomerang on the societies which deploy them .\nHowever , there is no price to pay for this self-inflicted damage because it \u2019 s all the fault of the covid or Putin , isn \u2019 t it , and so the restrictions/sanctions are ratcheted up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no scrutiny .\nLeft and Right are united in baying for what amounts to self-abuse , especially as the poor will bear the brunt .\nOnly a few cranks or marginalised figures on the Right ( Farage , Tucker Carlson ) or the Provisional wing of the Left ( Piers Corbyn and Jeremy Corbyn ) beg to differ .\nWith covid it was slightly different , thanks to a number of freedom-loving Conservative MPs , but the fact remains : Right and Left were broadly united on covid and even more so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be made of the climate \u2018 emergency \u2019 fandango .\nThe techniques used to develop the narrative are the same in each case .\nThe mainstream media open the spigots , as they have now with Ukraine , for an inescapable torrent of \u2018 coverage \u2019 indistinguishable from propaganda .\nDissenting voices , even distinguished professors and diplomats , are denigrated , marginalised , silenced and ignored .\nWar porn , hospital porn , swamp the media .\nCrisis actors ( featured in NHS ads and , allegedly , Ukrainian PR videos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clap for the Ukrainians ( well , nearly ) and believe all their claims , implicitly , just as we believed our politicians and public health officials .\nWe follow events by the hour .\nThe daily death count which worked so well with covid doesn \u2019 t work so well with Ukraine , because according to the UN the death count after two weeks is still in the low hundreds , a figure about which Yemenis and Syrians could only dream .\nNever mind , the daily refugee count will do .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to flagellate ourselves for never doing enough and being selfish .\nThe parallels between the two war scenarios , covid and Ukraine , are almost uncanny .\nEven down to details .\nFor example we knew already from the sensible doctors in South Africa that Omicron was a pussy , at least in countries which had already had high exposure to covid , but we still ignored them and went to panic stations .\nSimilarly , we blanked out the Africans when half the countries on that continent , as evidenced by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dragooned into condemning Russia .\nIndeed , countries representing more than half the world \u2019 s population refused to go along with the West \u2019 s narrative , but who \u2019 d have known that from oh so anti-racist Western media ?\nThe why of this congruence of wars is more tricky .\nSome are drawn to the simple answer that it \u2019 s all part of the same basic plot involving a cabal , globalists and the World Economic Forum .\nI wouldn \u2019 t dispute that those latter day white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interveners who try to impose Western-style democracy are often the same as those who wish to impose lockdowns and vaccines .\nBut I prefer to look deeper .\nIt \u2019 s often instructive to look at things through a religio-mythical lens for explanation of seismic society-wide developments .\nAnd what we see using this lens is that what links covidism , Russophobia , and climate zealotry \u2013 is a form of quasi-religious hysteria .\nSince at least 9/11 , to hear people speak , we have been living in the End Times .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we knew it , with Al Qaida , and later ISIS .\nThen the climate \u2018 emergency \u2019 prophesied by a child saint promised Extinction , before the covid came providentially along .\nPestilence did a good job of maintaining hysteria for two years but recently started flagging .\nWar was next up among these Horsemen of the Apocalypse .\n( Why war now , just as covid is waning ?\nWell possibly because Russia , which hoped for a negotiated outcome to a showdown but was ready to move to conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while omicron was rampant in that country ) .\nLurid terms like \u2018 annihilation \u2019 , \u2019 genocide \u2019 and \u2018 nuclear Armageddon \u2019 are now being bandied about with regard to Ukraine .\nLo and behold , we witness Putin not just demonised , but portrayed as Lucifer himself .\nThis is a conflict between Absolute Good and Absolute Evil .\nPutin has witches around him , does he not ?\nFor what are oligarchs if not witches ?\nAre they not subject to witch hunts ?\nI recommend reading The Crucible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Arthur Miller .\nHow those today hounding the oligarchs sound like those 17th century Puritan New Englanders who accused elderly women of cavorting with Lucifer on the village green !\nCan any serious person think that persecuting oligarchs will force Putin to turn his tanks around ?\nThe same applies to sanctions .\nIt is pure magical thinking to imagine that sanctions , which have never worked with any country in the past , will have cast some kind of spell over Russia and make it desist .\nNo media presenter ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanism by which this alchemy is to be accomplished , just as they never asked how lockdowns or masks worked in the face of all evidence .\nNeither do we hear anybody ask if the politicians and sages seriously think Russian soldiers will ever leave Ukraine while sanctions remain in place .\nMyths need heroes as well as villains .\nCue the Vaccines , the Holy Trinity of Pfizer , Astra Zeneca and Moderna , recently joined by NATO as heroes of the hour .\nVaccines , like baptism , used to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was growing up .\nNow in these infantilised times they are a rite of passage for adults .\nAlongside the use of face diapers .\nNATO , the Sword in Horsemen of the Apocalypse terms , was not long ago seen by the Presidents of the United States and France no less than an example of the living dead .\nNow it has cranked up out of its coffin , been given a booster shot and is miraculously revived .\nPulling all these elements together , what we have here with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the millennialism which has been emerging and shape-shifting in various guises for over thirty years .\nDiagnosing the hysteria and showing by what threads its various strands are joined is a useful first step to overcoming it .\nBy the way , the

.\nSpectator writer Justin Doherty , like so many others in western media , is doing his part to defeat the Russians by advancing the increasingly popular half-baked idea that assumes that higher wholesale gas and household energy costs are the new price of freedom and democracy in the West .\n\u2018 It \u2019 s our little sacrifice for those poor Ukrainians suffering under the jackboot of Vladimir Putin.\n\u2019 Yes , it \u2019 s certainly a very attractive polemic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convoluted and ridiculous argument , and smacks of a level of geopolitical desperation not seen in modern history , but it has nonetheless taken hold across large swaths of the Western intelligentsia .\nHere is the much-repeated claim : But Doherty goes even further , opining that one way we can all fight Putin is to take a cold shower in the morning .\nHe explains : I found myself in Berlin at the weekend gasping for breath in a cold shower , doing my bit for Ukraine .\nBerliners are a phlegmatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war two hours from their doorstep is triggering memories of much darker periods of conflict and stirring not-so-dormant feelings of solidarity and direct action .\nCould cold showers be the answer ?\nThe least we can do is turn our backs on Putin \u2019 s gas by taking a cold shower and turning off the heating .\nJust four per cent of the UK \u2019 s natural gas supply comes from Russia , so collective action could go a long way .\nThe invigorating thrill of a cold shower isn \u2019 t so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head around it .\nSome would say it \u2019 s actually good for you .\nThe central heating doesn \u2019 t need to be on , why not put on another jumper ?\nYou could cover yourself in deep heat if need be .\nThe government could encourage us by publishing daily reports on national energy usage , as we decisively reject Putin \u2019 s gas and help play our part in this war .\nYes , you read that right .\n\u2018 Fight those Russians by using less gas and electricity !\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it has a natural tendency to ignore context .\nHere the author casually omits the fact that wholesale energy prices began skyrocketing to record-breaking highs back as early as September and October \u2013 long before Putin began his NeoSoviet conquest for world domination .\nPreviously , conservatives weren \u2019 t so easily prone to succumbing to the sort of magical thinking that were

commitment , joining the elation of seeing Germany move towards militarizing itself , despite the fact that this is a reversal of 75 years of post-World War II allied collective security policy : Part of this new German arms bonanza will be to ship lethal weapons to the Ukrainian Armed Forces .\nWhat Doherty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London and New York conveniently fail to mention is that Germany will in fact

"content": "\u2018 Playbook .\nA book containing a sports team \u2019 s strategies and plays , especially in American football.\n\u2019 Yes , the playbook for Syria is now being used for Ukraine .\nBut is it Russia \u2019 s or America \u2019 s ?\nThe Russians in attacking Ukraine are taking leaves out of their Syrian playbook , so we are being constantly told .\nBut the American origin of this term gives us a clue as to what is really going on .\nOne of the plays being used is apparently the brandishing of chemical weapons .\nIt \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Syria in this regard .\nThe first alleged use of chemical weapons in Syria occurred in the Ghouta suburbs of Damascus in 2013 .\nAfter a vote in the British Parliament scuppered a Western plan to bomb Syria in retaliation , the Russians , not the West , took active steps to remove Syria \u2019 s stocks of chemical weapons , shepherding Syria through a process of dismantling all its stocks under international supervision and verification ( compare and contrast US research collaboration with Ukraine in biolabs so sensitive that records had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nClaims nevertheless continued to be made , never verified in situ by independent parties , that Syria was using chemical weapons .\nIn April 2018 reports emerged from Douma on the outskirts of Damascus that Syria had used chlorine gas in a particularly egregious attack on civilians .\nWithout waiting even the 48 hours needed for international inspectors to arrive , the US , UK and France launched punitive bombing raids on Syria .\nSubsequently , inspectors found evidence at the scene consistent with a false flag operation .\nThat evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under intense pressure from the US and UK .\nThe real lesson from the incident \u2013 that fraudsters were at work \u2013 was thus never learned and a spurious version of the truth prevailed .\nWhat really happened , many experts believe , was that jihadi groups affiliated with Al Qaida yet supported by Western powers fabricated the incident ( it wasn \u2019 t difficult with Western intelligence agencies and gullible Western media eager to pin blame on Assad ) in order to provide a pretext for the West to enter the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThese are but two among other similar incidences talking place over the course of the conflict .\nScroll forward four years .\nRussia , we are being repeatedly told , is preparing to use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine while pre-emptively covering itself by predicting use of a false flag .\nIn Syria , Assad was winning and had no need to use chemical weapons .\nIt would have been crazy to do so , when it was the only thing that could make the West bomb him .\nIn Ukraine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the one thing which would likely lead to direct NATO intervention .\nNo matter , the authorised version of the history of the Syrian conflict holds that abetted by Russia , Syria used chemical weapons , and so today Russia must be poised to do the same in Ukraine .\n\u2018 History is written by the victors \u2019 , Churchill is supposed to have said .\nWith Syria , given the West \u2019 s control of the narrative via its monopoly hold over international media , history is written by the losers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Syria in the Ukraine context .\nBut they are the wrong parallels , and the wrong lessons are being drawn from the Syrian ordeal .\nThe Russian version of the playbook , according to the West According to the Western narrative , enunciated by officials and echoed by reporters who seem to see it as their job to act like government press officers or cheerleaders , the Russian playbook in Syria is now being applied wholesale to Ukraine .\nIts chapters comprise of indiscriminate shelling , carpet bombing of cities , targeting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools and shelters , sieges of major towns , prevention of civilians from leaving through humanitarian corridors , commission of many other brutal war crimes , and using false flag accusations .\nThis indeed is how the Western media portrayed the Syrian conflict and are now doing the same for Ukrainian conflict .\nBut the picture presented distorts some key facts and obscures others .\nIt almost totally airbrushes out the jihadist opposition to Assad , just as the Ukrainian Nazis are being airbrushed out of the picture in Ukraine .\nThe Syrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy .\n\u2018 Collateral damage \u2019 , an Americanism we learnt to use in America \u2019 s war on Vietnam , becomes inevitable under such circumstances .\nCountless civilians died as US-led forces levelled most of Raqqa before driving ISIS out of it .\nDead bodies were still being retrieved from the rubble of Raqqa two years later .\nIs this the playbook we are talking about here , the one the Coalition used against ISIS ?\nThe same techniques of using human shields deployed by jihadists are now being used in Ukraine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mariupol , where this is happening most , is where the extreme nationalist Azov brigade have barracks , and that they have reportedly been firing from civilian buildings and preventing civilians from leaving ?\nSimilarly , who knew that jihadists in East Aleppo were constantly shelling civilian areas in government-held Western Aleppo ?\nOr that the amount of destruction in Aleppo was nothing like what was is being assumed , or that the \u2018 genocide \u2019 ( that other overworked term ) of a quarter of a million foretold by the professional hysterics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the bussing out of a few thousand fighters , who surrendered and were taken with their families to other jihadi-controlled areas ?\nIf anything , the lesson from Syria was that the Russians sometimes showed more restraint than their hosts .\nRussia forced the Syrian government , eager to recover East Aleppo , to delay operations while abortive parleys took place and the jihadists won more time to entrench their positions .\nRussia also forced the Syrian government to accept indulgent terms for the surrender of jihadists in the South , allowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no-go areas for government forces .\nThose familiar with these facts will not be surprised to learn that according to the UN civilian deaths in Ukraine so far are numbered in hundreds rather than the many thousands claimed by propagandists .\nNone of this is to condone all Russian actions , but in order to avoid repeating in Ukraine the mistakes the West made in Syria \u2013 it is important to see things as they really are .\nAnd in the Western playbook there were many mistakes .\nThe worst was to supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars \u2019 worth of arms and equipment , which only served to inflame the situation , abet terrorism and prolong Syria \u2019 s agony .\nHow much of the arms now being funnelled into Ukraine will end up in the Nazi battalions and later in the Middle East ?\nWill the arms really hasten the end of violence or prolong it ?\nA second leaf from the Western playbook for Syria now being used in spades a propos of Ukraine is sanctions .\nCruel , far-reaching sanctions in Syria have totally failed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s behaviour \u2019 ( our wicked adversaries have \u2018 behaviour \u2019 , our virtuous selves have \u2018 policies \u2019 ) while immiserating the Syrian people .\nSanctions on Russia are plainly doing more harm to the world economy than they are to Russia , and can not possibly change Russia \u2019 s \u2018 behaviour \u2019 in the short term .\nAnd is \u2018 crippling Russia \u2019 , with its echoes of German reparations post World War I , anyway really such a great idea ?\nThat other favourite staple of the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Syria \u2013 after stellar accomplishments in Afghanistan , Iraq and Libya , was precisely what brought about today \u2019 s crisis in Ukraine , for it was the US-backed removal of an elected President of Ukraine in 2014 which precipitated the chain of events leading to the present conflict .\nSEE ALSO : 2014 Maidan Coup \u2013 \u201c Ukraine On Fire \u201d with Oliver Stone The Western playbook provides that foreign leaders who refuse to bend the knee should always be portrayed as crazed and brutal .\nThey always need arraigning before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which the US denies for itself , to the extent of sanctioning a prosecutor who dares to pursue a US client state .\nThis personalisation and demonisation obviates any risk that policy makers might have to face up to the reality that other countries have legitimate concerns too .\nIn the court of Western public opinion the Great Powers have ensured a hanging jury for Assad , and now Putin .\nThe page in the US playbook to which administrations are most attached , however , the gift which keeps on giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they are using or planning to use chemical weapons .\nHas the world forgotten the non-existent Iraqi WMD ?\nThe watertight intelligence ?\nThe 45 minutes for rockets to reach British bases in Cyprus ?\nHow the US can have recourse to a similar ploy today , claiming Russia is planning something nefarious , without being hooted at in derision is merely testimony to the extent to which mainstream media has prostrated itself before power .\nThe most far-fetched claims can be made without a shred of media scrutiny .\nThat US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the \u2018 chemical weapons \u2019 claim is deeply disturbing .\nIf this is not the US laying the groundwork for a fake flag incident involving chemical weapons , or perhaps the bioweapons the US is accused of developing in Ukraine , it certainly looks like it .\nIf that is the case it is no longer playbooks we may be dealing with , it \u2019 s the Book of Lamentations .\n*** Author Peter Ford is a global affairs analyst , and the former British Ambassador

increasingly resembles the relationship between an abusive husband and his battered spouse .\nLike a wife who believes her husband still loves her even as he sends her to the hospital , the same lawmakers and Fox News figures who claim to have embraced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get played by a Regime that hates them .\nSure , it \u2019 s not nice when the Regime drinks too much and suddenly labels us all domestic terrorists , but patriotism requires that we unthinkingly serve this same regime when it wants to endanger American lives for another misadventure thousands of miles from our shores .\nWhen Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke before the U.S. Congress Wednesday morning , Republicans f\u00eated him with a standing ovation before his remarks and then another ovation afterwards .\nIn his speech , Zelensky pleaded for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ukraine , and even more punitive sanctions on Russia .\nIt was a plea for a dramatic escalation in the conflict towards World War 3 .\nAnd Republicans gave him two standing ovations in a row .\nWith the world on the edge of nuclear holocaust , Republicans cheered on a leader who says that World War 3 has already started .\nAfter Zelensky \u2019 s speech , saccharine Republicans took to the airwaves to demand that President Biden ship fighter jets into Ukraine , despite the dangers of such a provocation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee , said he was moved by video Zelensky showed during his speech that highlighted the atrocities Russia is carrying out in Ukraine against women and

a simple explanation : Fox News , Sean Hannity , and the GOP are reverting back to the leading roles they played in the run-up to the Iraq War .\nOf course , we don \u2019 t want to just bag on Hannity , who is likeable enough .\nBut the whole history of the Iraq War really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2003 , 90 percent of Republicans supported the decision to invade Iraq and violently topple Saddam Hussein \u2019 s government .\nBut \u201c supported \u201d undersells the intensity of the Iraq moment .\nOut of 272 Republicans in Congress , only seven voted against authorizing the invasion .\nFor three years , House Republicans renamed French fries to \u201c freedom fries \u201d and French toast to \u201c freedom toast \u201d in the House cafeteria .\nFox News hyped the war relentlessly during the leadup , and its hosts defended nearly every facet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Scott McConnell , and Taki Theodoracopulos founded The American Conservative in 2002 precisely because every other institution on the right , from the White House to Fox to National Review , was marching towards war in lockstep with the military-industrial complex .\nEven in 2008 , with WMDs still yet to be found and the Iraq insurgency roiling on , 73 percent still stood by the invasion .\nAmerican conservatives got bamboozled badly on Iraq , but nobody got bamboozled more than Hannity .\nIn the months leading up to the invasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allegation , and every lie that was used to sell the war .\nMonths before the Iraq invasion , in November 2002 , Hannity was already chomping at the bit for Saddam \u2019 s destruction .\nWhy ?\nTo get rid of those dastardly WMDs , of course : On December 9 , 2002 , Hannity told Fox News viewers that Saddam \u2019 s Iraq was full of camps training terrorists plotting new 9/11s : Even years afterwards , Hannity couldn \u2019 t accept he \u2019 d been sold a load of hokum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hannity still clung to his theory that the WMDs were real , and sneakily smuggled off to Syria just before the U.S. invasion .\nThanks to Republican credulity , the Pied Piper of the Globalist American Empire took all of America off to war , and the result was calamity .\nThe \u201c weapons of mass destruction \u201d that justified invasion did not exist .\nPerhaps to avoid admitting such a humiliating blunder , the Bush Administration switched to an agenda of \u201c democracy-building.\n\u201d 140,000 U.S. troops settled in for a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trillion .\nMore than 4,400 of those troops did not return .\nAmerica has made plenty of blunders as a global superpower , but the Iraq War was the worst .\nIt was entirely optional , easily avoidable , strategically worthless , hideously wasteful , and far too often , morally compromising .\nAs bad as a mistake as Iraq was , in the moment it can be understood .\nThe 9/11 attacks were a profound shock to the national psyche , and for years the nation remained paranoid that deadly enemies were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prelude to future , much deadlier attacks .\nNot only that , but the national security state had not spent 20 years lying about Afghanistan then , and had not declared war on American conservatives as a class , so the need to distrust them was not quite as obvious .\nFalling for the Iraq War the first time may be excused .\nWhat can not be excused is falling for the Deep State \u2019 s fanatical war rhetoric again , as it tries to drag the nation into World War 3 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly what is happening across the board , and it \u2019 s not just Hannity , either .\nOn

specific role almost from the very beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening up the Ukrainian economy to metropolitan capital .\nPrior to 2014 when Viktor Yanukovych was the president of Ukraine , that country had been in negotiations with the IMF as part of its trade integration with the European Union .\nThe IMF had asked Ukraine to undertake a number the security concerns of Russia arising from Ukraine

anti-people ( \u201c austerity \u201d ) measures ; and such \u201c opening up \u201d typically involves the taking over of natural resources of the countries and also their land areas by metropolitan capital .\nThe mechanism that the IMF typically uses towards this end is the imposition of \u201c conditionalities \u201d for giving loans to countries that are in need of balance of payments support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d .\nBreaking off negotiations with the IMF was tantamount to escaping the hegemony not just of international capital intent on imposing a neo-liberal regime , but of the Western imperialist powers , especially the U.S. , and hence the NATO .\nIn other words , NATO and the IMF were not seen as distinct organisations , each working in its own sphere of operation , with its own objective ; but organisations with similar and overlapping objectives .\nThe U.S. , peeved at Yanukovych \u2019 s temerity at turning to Russia instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further \u201c damage \u201d , and he was overthrown in a U.S.-sponsored coup which was carried out with the assistance of the Nazi elements in Ukraine that had been in the forefront of anti-Yanukovych demonstrations in the run up to the coup .\nThese elements have now become formally incorporated into the Ukrainian army through the inclusion in it of the Azov Battalion , a far-Right , all-volunteer , infantry military unit that earlier formed part of the military reserve of the National Guard of Ukraine .\nThe government that came to power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the European Union , for which it obtained a loan commitment of $ 27 billion from the IMF after showing its \u201c good intentions \u201d by cutting the gas subsidy to citizens by a half .\nThis loan had several notable features : first , it was huge , much larger ( in fact more than six times ) than what the IMF would normally provide in a comparable situation ; second , it was given to a country in the midst of a civil war ( as Ukraine then was ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , third , it was known from the very beginning that the loan could not possibly be paid back , so that the only means through which it would be sought to be recovered would be through metropolitan capital taking control of the country \u2019 s land area and mineral resources ( the most prominent of which is natural gas ) .\nThe IMF \u2019 s operations in Ukraine in 2014 therefore bring out not just the typical aspect of its policy , which is to open up the economy to metropolitan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , namely as an aid to U.S. cold war objectives .\nThe objective of opening up to metropolitan capital , the markets , land and natural resources of Ukraine could have been served in 2014 even with a much smaller loan from the IMF .\nBut the extraordinary size of the loan underscores the nexus between the U.S. administration ( that wants Ukraine within its orbit ) , the Ukrainian oligarchs ( who want to take their wealth out of the country in dollars or Euros ) , the post-coup government ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfers ) , and the IMF ( that has to foot the bill ) .\nNow , in the wake of the invasion by Russia , Ukraine has again approached the IMF for support ; and the current IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva has recommended to the IMF board of directors that it should provide that support .\nThe precise amount of support and the purpose for which it is being asked , are still not clear ; but one thing remains certain : after the current crisis comes to an end in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that resolution takes , Ukraine will become a second Greece in Europe .\nIn the case of Greece too , the IMF loan was much larger than is the usual practice for that organisation .\nMost of it was meant really to ensure that the European banks that had lent to Greece got back their money .\nAnd now Greece is caught in the vicious grip of perpetual debt .\nThe IMF , it follows , has altered greatly from the days of its inception .\nWhen it was started at Bretton Woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an international regime that was predicated on the pursuit of a dirigiste economic strategy .\nIn fact John Maynard Keynes , the British economist who had been an advocate of dirigiste intervention , along with Harry Dexter White , the American representative , had been the principal authors of this international regime .\nWhile each country imposed , and continued to impose trade and capital controls , if a balance of payments problem arose in a particular country then it could borrow from the IMF in order to \u201c stabilise \u201d its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolved into a protagonist of \u201c structural adjustment \u201d , where it did not just give loans to tide over transitional balance of payments problems ( until the economy experiencing a balance of payments deficit had \u201c stabilised \u201d itself ) , but actually promoted a neo-liberal regime , namely a set of policies entailing the dismantling of all trade and capital controls , privatisation of public sector assets , introduction of \u201c labour market flexibility \u201d ( which means attacking trade unions ) .\nFrom being a facilitator of a dirigiste regime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a destroyer of the dirigiste regime and an instrument for ushering in a neo-liberal regime .\nIt has become an instrument in the hands of international finance capital , enabling its penetration into every corner of the globe .\nBut it is not just an instrument of international finance capital ; it also serves as an instrument of Western metropolitan powers that stand behind this capital .\nWhile defending the interests of international finance capital , it gets dovetailed into the entire coercive apparatus of Western metropolitan powers .\nPutin \u2019 s is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hegemony of international finance capital .\nHe is no socialist carrying on an ideological battle against the domination of a neighbouring country by an organisation that acts in the interests of international finance capital .\nHis concern is only with Russian security ; it is confined only to Russia not being hemmed in by NATO .\nAnd his offer of help to Yanukovych in the place of IMF \u201c assistance \u201d arose only for this reason .\nHe is in other words concerned only with the role of the IMF as a promoter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the role of the IMF as a promoter of neo-liberalism in general .\nIn fact , the gross inequality , and even absolute destitution that a neo-liberal regime spawns are not too far from what Putin himself has \u201c achieved.\n\u201d Monthly Review author Prabhat Patnaik is an Indian political economist and

lot of important insight about his country \u2019 s perspective of International Relations , its ongoing special military operation in Ukraine , and America \u2019 s aggressive geopolitical motives .\nThe present piece will focus on some of the highlights in order to inform interested readers who might not have been aware of this interview due to their governments \u2019 censorship of Russian media .\nThe top Russian diplomat is convinced that the entire US-led Western pressure campaign against his country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia , to contain Russia , to stop Russia \u2019 s development and to reduce Russia to a zero role in world politics and world economy , world trade , world sports , art , science , education.\n\u201d This is being done , he believes , due to the US \u2019 desire to restore its declining unipolar hegemony which he says \u201c has been much more manifested by the Biden administration.\n\u201d According to him , \u201c The European Union already , I think 99 percent , stopped trying to be independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps repeating that strategic autonomy for the European Union is his goal and he would be fighting for it , but my guess is that he would not succeed.\n\u201d Basically , Lavrov believes that the EU can no longer be regarded as independent since it voluntarily surrendered its sovereignty to the US .\nFor this reason , \u201c if there was any illusion that we can one day rely on our Western partners , this illusion is no longer there .\nWe will have to rely only on ourselves and on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The end effect of what the US just did to Europe presages what it envisions for the rest of the world , which Lavrov predicts is \u201c an American village and maybe American saloon where who is strongest is calling the shots.\n\u201d Nevertheless , there are countries that resist this unipolar hegemonic model , including \u201c China , India , Brazil , Argentina , Mexico \u201d , his own country , and others .\nActually , Lavrov implied that this includes most of the countries in the world since only a comparatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposing sanctions against Russia .\nHe mentioned that most of those who voted against it at the UN haven \u2019 t followed suit with sanctions sine they only did so due to unprecedented American pressure .\nIn his words , \u201c So a majority of those countries who voted with the West , they did not and they would not introduce sanctions against Russia .\nThey believe that it \u2019 s , you know , not a very big price to pay for their own practical cooperation with Russia , just to vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West for entirely propagandistic purposes.\n\u201d He added that \u201c threats to individual delegates regarding their assets in the United States , bank accounts , children studying in universities \u201d and other means were employed .\nOn the scandalous topic of US biolabs in Ukraine , Lavrov described some of the dangerous pathogens that were being experimented with there , including those \u201c which could be related to the ethnic groups living in the east of Ukraine and in neighboring regions of Russia.\n\u201d In other words , he implied that America was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target people with the Russian genome , which would then have been used by its ethno\u2013fascist proxies in Kiev for genocidal purposes .\nFurthermore , \u201c the Americans some years ago decided that it is too dangerous to do these things on their own soil .\nSo they moved all these threatening and dangerous activities to other countries , and more and more they concentrate their research and experiments around the borders of the Russian Federation and China.\n\u201d This clearly proves that the US \u2019 Hybrid War against the dual engines of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crucial biological warfare component .\nIndirect and unconventional means are being employed by America throughout the course of its campaign against Russia precisely because it knows that directly attacking its target could

will ever come to fruition .\nNevertheless , he noted that Zelensky is trying to get the US \u2019 anti-Russian lobby to push Biden to be more confrontational .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ some members of his own administration such as those who \u2019 ve briefed TikTokers on their country \u2019 s anti-Russian policies .\nLavrov decried those efforts as amounting to the propagandization of innocent children

"Pentagon-Ukraine Bio Labs: The Hunter Biden Connection", "content": "It would be an understatement to say the Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov announcement of US-funded bio labs in Ukraine and concerns over the development of biological weapons , had its fair share of attention over the last few weeks .\nOnly the story doesn \u2019 t end there , with the trail of evidence leading directly to the US political , military , intelligence , and pharmaceutical establishments .\nUndoubtedly , this story has all the ingredients for a giant international scandal , and when juxtaposed with the current war in Ukraine , it has the potential to influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the conflict .\nStill , Washington continues to deny any involvement .\nWhen pressed on the matter , Pentagon press secretary John Kirby referred to the Russian claims as \u201c a bunch of malarkey.\n\u201d However , despite the many evasions and obfuscations from US officials , the facts of this case remain overwhelming .\nWhile US officials and western mainstream media quickly denied the existence of any US involvement in these biological facilities , their claims are confounded by the release overwhelming evidence to the contrary , including the existence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and recently removed from the US Embassy in Kyiv \u2019 s official website , confirming the presence of at least 11 bio labs , plus 2 other new labs which were due to be constructed in Odessa and Kyiv , These US bio labs situated in Ukraine were established between 2009 and 2012 , and paid for by the US Department of Defense ( DOD ) and the DTRA Defense Threat Reduction Agency .\nThe program appears to be an offspring of the 1991 Soviet Nuclear Threat Reduction Act .\nAmongst other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the risk of bioterrorism and prevent the proliferation of biological weapons , including extremely dangerous pathogens .\nThis was followed by a 2005 bi-lateral treaty agreement between the United States and Ukraine on weapons proliferation , signed by representatives of the US Department of Defense and the Ukrainian Ministry of Health .\nIzvestia published on 26 May 2020 an article which raises concerns about the existence of \u201c eight laboratories that were built and modernized with the participation of the US Defense Special Weapons Agency ( DTRA ) as part of the Special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which provided \u201c assistance to Ukraine in preventing the spread of dangerous pathogens.\n\u201d The article followed claims by Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharova , who warned on 17 April 2020 , that \u201c the United States may be developing deadly pathogens \u201d in its \u201c overseas laboratories , \u201d adding that , \u201c the United States is trying to strengthen its biological presence , including in the post-Soviet space.\n\u201d Things got slightly more serious when Commander of the Russian CBRN ( Nuclear , Radiological , Biological and Chemical ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of its UP-4 project with the participation of laboratories in Kyiv , Kharkiv and Odessa , the United States appeared to be working to develop potentially powerful biological weapons .\nOne of the purposes of the project appears to involve the spread of particularly dangerous infections through migratory birds .\nKirillov added , \u201c Considering that Ukraine has a unique geographical position where transcontinental migration routes intersect , they were studying 145 biological species within the framework of this project , \u201d adding that \u201c at least two species of migratory birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which pass through Russian territories.\n\u201d According to Kirillov , it was planned to spread particularly dangerous infectious diseases with the help of birds .\nIn particular , it refers to a highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza and Newcastle disease .\n\u201c Of all methods developed in the United States to destabilize the epidemiological situation , this one is one of the most reckless and irresponsible ones , as it does not allow to control the further development of the situation , \u201d the official said .\n\u201c With a high degree of probability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tasks of the United States and its allies was to create bio agents that could selectively target various ethnic groups of the population , \u201d Igor Kirillov concluded .\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense added that the obtained documents confirmed the transfer of many biological samples taken from Ukrainian people abroad .\nFor example , Germany is funding project No .\n68727 EN to study the pathogens of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever and Hantaviruses .\nAs part of the project , hundreds of samples of blood serum taken from residents of various regions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tropical Medicine in Hamburg .\nThe samples belonged only to the Slavic ethnic group .\nAdditionally , Russian Defense Ministry Spokesman Igor Konashenkov , added that , \u201c the American side planned to conduct works on bird , bat and reptile pathogens subsequently proceeding to researching the possibility of them transmitting African swine fever and anthrax.\n\u201d Needless to say , the presence of these programs and the fact they are being funded by the Pentagon , will be regarded as a national security threat to the Russian Federation .\nIn a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following : \u201c UKR_Leaks provide a unique insight into the procedure for destroying the strains studied in biological laboratories in Ukraine , following the launch of the Russian military operation .\nOne of the documents indicates that on 25 February 2022 , the day after the launch of the Russian invasion , the following strains were completely destroyed in a laboratory in Kharkov.\n\u201d This may include ( but not limited to ) the following pathogens : \u2022 Escherichia coli ( bacteria that can cause ulcers , urinary tract infections and even prostatitis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can cause urinary tract infections and bloodstream infections ) \u2022 Shigella sonnei and Shigella flexneri ( bacteria that cause shigellosis , an intestinal infection ) \u2022 Staphylococcus aureus ( Staphylococcus aureus , which can cause food poisoning , as well as local or generalized infections up to and including sepsis ) \u2022 Klebsiella pneumonia ( pneumonia and urinary tract infections , but a virulent strain from Asia can infect the central nervous system and has a high mortality rate ) According to reports acknowledged by the Russian Ministry of Defense , 232 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 containers of tularemia , 10 of brucellosis and five of plague , have all been destroyed in Kyiv .\nThe Russian authorities believe that in total , there are 30 such biological laboratories based in Ukraine which are financed and supervised by the Americans ( with a budget of over 200 million dollars ) .\nFinally , on the 11th March 2022 , Serge\u012d Lavrov , Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation requested a meeting with the United Nation Security Council for Russian United Nations Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia to elaborate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence report on the alleged US-backed Ukrainian Bioweapon Program .\nFrom an investigative point of view , we must therefore take a closer look into the companies entrusted by the United States and Ukrainian government to undertake the construction and management of these highly sensitive bio labs .\nIt is difficult , if not impossible to believe that such a vast project could receive the go-ahead without broad political support in the US .\nWhen it comes to government programs , a general rule of thumb is that where there is political support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NGOs .\nHence , we must take a look at the corporate contractors who supply the DoD , DTRA and USAID in order to understand their background , and where any conflicts of interest may have occurred .\nThrough these contractors , we may also discover clues as to why a country located in Europe \u2019 s own \u2018 backyard , \u2019 and which borders Russia was chosen to develop such highly contentious research and associated bio labs .\nUntil recently , few were aware that this Ukrainian bio lab story goes much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but straight into the nexus of US political and corporate power .\nThe Bidens Web of interests is large but first let \u2019 s take a look at Metabiota .\nMetabiota was previously known as Global Viral ( GV ) , which was previously known as Global Viral Forecasting Institute ( GVFI ) , initially founded as an organization focused on the study of infectious diseases , their transmission between animals and humans , and the risk involved with their global spread .\nHowever , these areas of research are now shifted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on data and risk analysis associated with disease outbreaks .\nThis firm is a key fulcrum in the new global pandemic industrial complex .\nOn their corporate home page , Metabiota states : It specializes in the big data and computer modeling of historical and present-day epidemics , and touts , among other capabilities , the \u201c tools to map and analyze operational and life insurance exposures , indices.\n\u201d Global Viral started out as a non-profit in 2008 with seed funding from Google and the Skoll Foundation , and 22 other investors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also revealing that the initial round of investment Series A funding was led by none other than Rosemont Seneca Partners .\nMetabiota has two board members , Neil Callahan and John Deloche .\nBoth Callahan and Deloche are a part of Rosemont Seneca .\nRosemont Seneca Partners is an investment fund firm .\nThe fund was named after the Rosemont Farm , the Heinz family estate located near Pittsburgh .\nThe firm was founded in 2009 by Christopher Heinz , stepson of former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry , Devon Archer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ & Fitch model who was Heinz \u2019 s college classmate , and Hunter Biden , son of current US President Joe Biden .\nAs for Heinz he ended his business relationship with the pair in 2014 after Biden and Archer joined the board of Burisma Holdings , a Ukrainian energy company with its fair share of scandals connected to the Bidens .\nBoth the Burisma and Rosemont Seneca Partners websites are both currently down , but with the help of the Wayback Machine , we can see Metabiota , featured on the Rosemont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Metabiota has offices in San Francisco , Washington DC , and Guangzhou , China , as well as outposts for data collection in other parts of Asia and Africa .\nMetabiota is involved with very powerful outfits such as US DoD , DTRA , USAID , and the World Economic Forum ( WEF ) , to name just a few .\nAs of 2014 , Metabiota started to receive funding from US Department of Defence which is confirmed here on USASPENDING.gov .\nIt \u2019 s especially worth noting that not only is Metabiota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but so is Global Viral Forecasting Inc .\nAccording to the Metabiota web site the company was involved in Iraq under the Biological Threat Reduction Integrating Contract ( BTRIC ) where they partnered with major US government contractor Black & Veatch on DTRA \u2019 s awarded Cooperative Threat Reduction Integrating Contract ( CTRIC ) III in Iraq with an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity ( ID/IQ ) contract ceiling of $ 970 million .\nIn 2014 Metabiota was also awarded funding by the European Commission to help fight Ebola , as part of the EU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European funding program for research and innovation .\nWhen it comes to government contracts , the risk for conflicts of interest is high , especially when such \u2018 big ticket \u2019 international contracts are being awarded .\nAs demonstrated above , we can see the former Vice President \u2019 s own son , Hunter Biden and his firm Rosemont Seneca directly involved in the financing of a US federal contractor known as Metabiota .\nSEE ALSO : Hunting for Hunter : Evidence Reveals Biden , Burisma Ukraine Bond Scandal , Tied to U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrew Weber , head of Global Partnerships at Metabiota in 2016 , who is also seen here in 2011 at the Lugar Center in Tbilisi Georgia .\nIMAGE : Andrew C. Weber ( on the right ) was US Assistant Secretary of Defense ( 2009-2014 ) and US DoD Deputy Coordinator for Ebola Response ( 2014-2015 ) .\nIn addition , we also have former US Center for Diseases Control ( CDC ) scientist Nita Madhav who is the current CEO of Metabiota , confirming once more the revolving door between government agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there more to Metabiota we should know about ?\nThe answer is yes .\nHere we can also turn our focus for a moment on the founder and chairman of Metabiota , Dr. Nathan Daniel Wolfe , PhD , an American virologist who first created Global Viral Forecasting Institute ( GVFI ) a nonprofit research initiative dedicated to preventing pandemics , before in 2007 transitioning to Global Viral who eventually gave birth to a commercial offshoot known today as Metabiota , a pioneer in epidemic risk modeling .\nIn addition to this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also serves on the editorial board of EcoHealth Alliance a company who became famous for its notorious \u201c gain of function \u201d research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in Wuhan , China , the alleged epicenter of the SARS COV2 outbreak .\nThe CEO of EcoHealth Alliance is Peter Dazsak , who works with Dr Nathan Wolfe as part of a consortium and initiative led by USAID called , \u201c PREDICT \u201d .\nWolfe \u2019 s company was also involved in the \u201c Bellagio Initiative \u201d within the Global Virome Project , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EcoHealth Alliance , and the US Office of Biodefense Research Resources & Transnational Research with the participation the infamous Dr Anthony Fauci from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) .\nVirology Moguls : Dr. Anthony Fauci and Peter Daszak played central roles in funding the suspected Wuhan viral disaster .\nMoreover , Dr. Wolfe was also a member of DARPA \u2019 s Defence Science Research Council.\n( DSRC ) .\nDr Wolfe moves in interesting circles , including seemingly unlikely characters like Ghislaine Maxwell , who was recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeffrey Epstein .\nPictured : Nathan Wolfe ( Metabiota ) , Larry Cohen ( Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation ) , Dave Fenton ( Fenton Communications ) , and Saul Griffith ( Manaki Power ) together at industry networking summit ( Image from THE EDGE \u201c BILLIONAIRES \u2019 DINNER 2009 ) Pictured : Nathan Myhrvold , Intellectual Ventures , formerly Chief Technology Officer at Microsoft , Marrisa Mayer ( Google ) , and Nathan Wolfe ( Image from THE EDGE \u201c BILLIONAIRES \u2019 DINNER 2009 ) On August 22 , 2017 , Metabiota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced two market innovators , Munich Reinsurance Company , the world \u2019 s largest reinsurer and a leading expert on global risk solutions , and In-Q-Tel Inc , a World-class , cutting-edge technologies incubator for National Security also known as IQT .\nIt is widely regarded as a corporate front for the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , allowing the US intelligence establishment to both steer and be directly involved in most cutting edge technological ventures hatched in the United States .\nIn 2021 , Metabiota was shortlisted by the WEF to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d which doesn \u2019 t come as a big surprise since both Metabiota and Dr. Nathan Wolfe are already existing members of the WEF ( Link 1 , Link 2 ) .\nWolfe is also an alumni of Klaus Schwab \u2019 s World Economic Forum Young Global Leaders program .\nGoing back to Ukraine , it is important to consider who the main contractor responsible for building and transferring these bio labs over to the Ukrainian health authorities are .\nB & V aka Black & Veatch , is such contractor company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is considered as a major US DoD contractor involved in the construction of bio labs in many countries around the world .\nFrom their own website : \u201c Black & Veatch completed Ukraine \u2019 s first Biological Safety Level 3 ( BSL-3 ) laboratory in Odessa on time and under budget .\nThe new facility enhances the government \u2019 s existing disease surveillance systems to detect , report and respond to bioterrorism attacks , epidemics and potential pandemics .\nThe BSL-3 laboratory in Odessa was designed and constructed by Black & Veatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the region and the first to be commissioned , accredited and operational under the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency \u2019 s ( DTRA ) Biological Threat Reduction Program ( BTRP ) .\n\u201d Another player in this same space is CH2M Hill , a subsidiary of Dallas-based Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. CH2M Hill is another major US DoD contractor who was awarded $ 341.5 million DTRA contracts under the Pentagon \u2019 s program for bio-laboratories in Georgia , Uganda , Tanzania , Iraq , Afghanistan , South East Asia .\nHalf of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was allocated to the Lugar Center in Tbilisi , Georgia , as indicated in the very detailed report in 2018 by investigative journalist Dilyana Gaytandzhieva .\nThis includes a $ 22.8 million contract ( 2020-2023 ) for two bio laboratories ; the State Scientific Research Institute of Laboratory Diagnostics and Veterinary-Sanitary Expertise ( Kyiv ILD ) and the State Service of Ukraine for Food Safety and Consumer Protection Regional Diagnostic Laboratory ( Odesa RDL ) .\nGaytandzhieva exposes the Pentagon \u2019 s 5-year long project in Georgia and Ukraine , including documents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from both Ukraine and Georgia .\nThe Pentagon had conducted biological experiments with a potentially lethal outcome on 4,400 soldiers in Ukraine and 1,000 soldiers in Georgia .\nAccording to leaked documents , all volunteer deaths should be reported within 24 h ( in Ukraine ) and 48 h ( in Georgia ) .\nIt \u2019 s important to note that US personnel are indemnified for deaths and injuries to the local population , something which they could not do in the United States .\nIs this one of the reasons for conducting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are perennially high on the global corruption index ?\nUS Senator Richard Lugar had travelled to Tbilisi , Georgia on numerous occasions to encourage and market the Nunn-Lugar Global project .\nHis most recent mission at the time was in 2008 , weeks after Russia \u2019 s invasion of Georgia .\nSounds familiar\u2026 the Lugar Research Center came to the public \u2019 s attention in 2017 , when Russian authorities repeatedly alleged that the centre was engaged in biological weapons development for the United States .\nAlso hidden in plain site , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry in all of this .\nArms Watch exposed the role of Gilead Sciences in Georgia , reporting the following in 2020 : What \u2019 s important to note here is how this Big Pharma scandal ties to Ukraine .\nAt around the same time these drug safety concerns were known internally to Gilead through its Georgia operations and elsewhere , Gilead was still attempting to strong-arm the Ukrainian Ministry of Health and Drug Regulation Authority into accepting its expensive patented Hepatitis C drug \u201c Sovaldi \u201d \u2013 as opposed to cheaper generic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known what Gilead knew at the time , but kept obscured from public view .\nThese vignettes demonstrate the deep involvement of the pharmaceutical cartel in this bio lab story \u2013 one which warrants much more investigation , as well as the link between Big Pharma lobbying in Washington and the establishment of these US taxpayer-funded biological facilities situated around the globe .\nNow let \u2019 s go back to Black & Veatch\u2026 When it comes to the world of big government contracts , always follow the money .\nThe Defense Threat Reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ & Veatch Special Projects Corp. ( Black & Veatch ) one of its Biological Threat Reduction Integrating Contracts ( BTRIC ) in 2008 .\nThe 5-year IDIQ contract ( with a 5-year option ) has a collective ceiling of $ 4B among the five selected contractors .\nDTRA also competitively awarded Black & Veatch ( Integrating Contractor ) the first task order under BTRIC , BTRIC TO1 in Ukraine in 2008 .\nBTRIC TO1 is a vital part of the Cooperative and Biological Threat Reduction ( CTR and BTR ) program of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ / DTRA and Implementing ( Executive ) Agents of the Ukraine \u2013 Ministry of Health ( MoH ) , Academy of Agrarian Sciences ( AAS ) and State Committee for Veterinary Medicine ( SCVM ) and the Ukrainian I. I. Mechnikov Anti-Plague Research Institute in Odessa upgraded to a BSL-3 under DTRA contract in 2011 .\nAs per Black & Veatch , the lab was designed for work with pathogens that can be \u201c introduced through a bioterrorism attack.\n\u201d This is not a trivial detail , as it speaks directly to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these bio labs \u2013 for both biological research , as well as bioweapons development .\nLooking deep into the UKR Leaked files and taking the time to find translated documents , we can see the project management on the Ukrainian part consists of scientists and personnel from the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense ( last page of the PDF below ) , a key detail which confirms the defence nature of these projects .\nHowever , if it is clearly stated that the Beneficiary/Executive Agent is the Ministry of Health of Ukraine , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved ?\nThis speaks to potential for a joint-military operation with the United States Pentagon , ostensibly making this a NATO operation on Ukrainian soil .\nThat would be an understandable red line for Russia\u2026 .\nOn March 8 , 2022 , US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs , Victoria Nuland , confirmed before a US Senate Committee recently that it was working with Kyiv to prevent Russia from accessing \u201c materials \u201d from Ukraine \u2019 s Pentagon funded biological laboratories .\nHer statement truly begs for more questions .\nPerhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what are Ukraine \u2019 s benefits for getting rid of all the pathogens they were studying if such pathogens are already known to the world therefore , not representing any new epidemic risk , assuming they were handled properly ?\nWhy would that be of any concern to the United States ?\nOr is there more to this story ?\nThe bottom line here though , is that by her own admission , the Russian concerns were in fact legitimate , and their allegations of dangerous US-managed biological agents in Ukraine are hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the same impression and might have felt it was time for them to give the US Government a taste of their own medicine , when Beijing called on March 8th for the United States to release all data pertaining to its biological laboratories in Ukraine , and urged all relevant parties to ensure their safety .\nChinese spokesperson Zhao Lijian insisted on getting all the specific and relevant information , including what viruses are stored in these bio labs , as well as the nature of the research that is being carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ INDEPENDENT MEDIA PLATFORM HERE", "author": "LFC NEWS", "url": "https://21stcenturywire.com/2022/03/23/pentagons-ukraine-bio-labs-the-hunter-biden-connection/", "published": "Wed, 23 Mar 2022 13:56:36 +0000", "published_utc": 1648058196, "collection_utc": 1648072808}, {"id": "21stcenturywire--2022-03-24--Ketanji Brown Jackson is Asked: What is a Woman?

politicians who put him there .\nBelow is a statement from Brentnall Solicitors in Belfast who are acting on behalf of their client who wishes to remain anonymous .\nI can fully understand their reticence to be identified in the toxic environment that we find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : A Brentnall Legal client today lodged a formal challenge to the decision by British State media regulatory body \u2018 OFCOM \u2019 to withdraw Russia Today \u2019 s broadcasting licence ; holding that partisan censorship is both contrary to public law , contrary to European Convention rights , contrary to the Human Right Act and Irrational , in that it hampers informed consensus and so prolongs conflict .\nThe Applicant seeks to remain anonymous for reasons of personal safety in the current social climate .\nThe Applicant is a former Irish political prisoner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is a keen and active advocate for the Irish peace process who regularly dedicates his time to meeting international delegations of influence within former , current and potential conflict zones with a view to utilising hisown experiences in order to promote conflict resolution and avoidance of violence there .\nIn this capacity the Applicant has in recent years travelled to former and current conflict effected regions of Europe , where he conducted dialogue with former political prisoners , combatants , and other political figures of influence , sharing his own insight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolution as an alternative to violent politics .\nIn 2015 , he met with representatives of Russian speaking \u2018 separatist \u2019 activists in the already war-torn Donbass region of Ukraine and shared his ideas , experiences and perspectives of conflict resolution with a view to assisting with a peaceful resolution there .\nSince that time , the Applicant has been of the informed opinion that Western European state coverage of the Donbass/Ukraine conflict ; its causes and exacerbations was grossly insufficient , leading to what today is a dearth of relevant knowledge on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukraine .\nThe Applicant strongly feels that this absence of relevant knowledge may now have real , stark and grave consequences ; given that popular and widespread discourse is occurring around the potential for NATO countries ( including the UK ) to get involved in the ongoing conflict , leading to potentially

governments on policies from the coronavirus vaccine , to the climate change , and roll-out to digital transformation , according to a new report released by the French Senate .\nThe revelations contained in this report are extraordinary , and expose the inner workings of the highest echelons of the French state , and what can only be described as the near-complete corporate capture of the bureaucracy .\nThe findings of the report have since been adopted unanimously by committee members on March 16 , and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a trans-partisan bill has already been announced .\nWhat has been revealed is breathtaking , and opens the door to what could be one of the most consequential scandals in modern European politics .\nSummary report of French Senate Commission Inquiry into the Growing Influence of Private Consulting Firms on Public Policy This article will not only examine the corporate takeover of whole government departments , but also look at the risk-benefit analysis of government over the use of consultancy services and outline the danger which lies with such Public Private Partnerships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of consultancy firms \u2019 deep and problematic ties with the Executive Branch of the French Government .\nIt is important to examine the powerful consultancy firms which underpin a much larger transnational network .\nThis raises a number of important questions : do they represent a danger to countries \u2019 national security , and what is the likelihood of conflict of interest taking place ?\nAre elected officials and civil servants taking a back seat and to non-elected private individuals and their companies who are allowed to steer public policy in favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a four-month parliamentary inquiry looking into lucrative contracts granted to consultancy firms like of Accenture , Bain & Company , Boston Consulting Group ( BCG ) , Cap Gemini , Deloitte , Eurogroup , EY , McKinsey & Company , PwC , Roland Berger , and Wavestone , the French Senate Commission has releasing its findings \u2013 and the outcome is rather damming .\nThe inquiry was lead by senators and the French government opposition bench .\nThe use of consultancy firms by the French administration has more than doubled since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mandate .\nAccording to the Senate commission report , a noticeable 45 % increase in 2021 has been identified , some of which can be attributed to the Covid-19 pandemic .\nMany serious questions and findings have emerged from the Senate committee inquiry report , including the likelihood that Karim Tadjeddine , an Associate Director at McKinsey & Company , may have perjured himself during a Senate hearing when according to Senator \u00c9liane Assassi he claimed under oath that McKinsey was paying taxes in France .\nDespite McKinsey being awarded many contracts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter , with the help of the government budget department , will reveal that McKinsey has not paid any taxes in France for at least 10 Years .\nHow can this be ?\nIn a press conference , Eliane Assasi will go on describing the government use of these consultancy firms as a \u201c reflex \u201d and outlined how these companies are embedded at the highest level within the government , and integrally involved in most of the major government reform projects , including the pension reform scheme , the housing benefits reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government \u2019 s economic recovery plan .\nThe conclusion of the 350-page report is very alarming .\nNaturally , the people of France want answers .\nFollowing the 2007 election of President Nicolas Sarkozy , the use of consultancy companies became a phenomenon with firms like McKinsey , Deloitte , Cap Gemini , BCG , and Accenture securing deals worth about \u20ac250 million during his tenure .\nFirms sought to create a growth market with governments growth drivers in government in order to compensate for the slump in the business sector .\nUnprecedented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are part of a much broader budget which was allocated by the French government to hire consultancy firms to assisting in the design and implementation ( including operational ) of public policy projects in support of the DITP ( inter ministerial directorate for public transformation ) and the inter ministerial digital directorate ( DINUM ) , and the modernization of all their departments .\nMore alarming is the fact that such companies where hired to work directly on legislative reforms .\nWhile these firms may claim that their quest to secure lucrative government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but rather as an investment in a Private Public Partnership , the reality is that this is a form of lobbying which ensures that numerous high-level government officials are well looked after as they eventually return to the corporate world for few years holding top position in French CAC top 40 companies , before returning to the political scene .\nThis \u2018 revolving door \u2019 between government and the consultancy industry is where the real money is made for consultancy firms and their directors .\nIn reality , only 5 % of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sector , the rest is secured with large corporate accounts .\nHowever , the back and forth between the public and private sector is so well established that the French have given it a name : \u201c Pantouflage \u201d The so-called \u201c Pantouflage \u201d has increasingly been at the centre of many scandals in France ; government officials \u2019 constant incestuous back-and-forth between the corporate world and government has gradually eroded away at the foundations of democracy , allowing all forms of conflicts of interest to take place .\nOf course , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , at some stage , to go back to work in the private sector \u2013 which is not a crime in itself , but returning to the political stage afterwards shouldn \u2019 t even be an option .\n\u201c Pantouflage \u201d is where a senior civil servant leaves their post with the state and joining a private company , an example of institutional elite corruption .\nWithin the context of the COVID-19 pandemic , we can see governments around the world resorting to a reliance on high-powered consultancy firms to formulate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program , and its associated procurement and logistics .\nIn the United States , McKinsey secured $ 19.3 million worth of contracts which turned out to be a mere down payment , as 10 days later the US Defence Health Agency added more funding \u2013 bringing the VA Contract \u2019 s value to an excruciating $ 22.5 million , and all this in just the first months of the pandemic , according to investigative site ProPublica .\nAs for the United Kingdom , the bills of the Boston Consulting Group aka BCG , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 people to work on the government \u2019 s Covid testing program .\nConsultants \u2019 fees were estimated at \u00a36,250 a day over the course of four months , according to report in the Guardian .\nIt \u2019 s important to note here the hundreds of millions of euros which privileged corporate suppliers netted from these unprecedented testing , track and trace apps , PPE , and vaccination programs \u2013 with foreign consultancy firms embedded at the very center of the government process for the selection and awarding of these super contracts .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ performers are Boston Consulting Group and Bain & Company who posted their best years ever during the pandemic .\n\u20ac550 billion was allocated to protect the economy from the effects of the novel coronavirus in Germany according to DEVEX Interactive dashboard which keeps track of where the such funding is going , who is supplying the money , and the strategic focus for the funding .\nAs reported by Consultancy.eu in March 2020 , a strong growth in Europe \u2019 s largest consulting markets had lifted the continent \u2019 s consulting industry to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion during this period , with European consultancy powerhouses France and Germany leading the way .\nDuring the \u2018 public health \u2019 crisis , the call for employing more consulting firms was not only limited to the first wave of the Covid pandemic , a period when the State was seen to be unprepared , and when Europe appeared to be surprised by the scale of the alleged contagion .\nHowever , the use of private consultants continued throughout the duration of the crisis .\nEnter McKinsey , who was drafted in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization and monitoring of France \u2019 s national vaccination campaign , spanning from November 2020 to February 4 , 2022 .\nThe new \u2018 McKinsey cabinets \u2019 were seen to have lent a hand to the State on the key aspects of the crisis , and they are still in charge today .\nThe senate reports indicate also that Accenture intervened to direct the implementation of information systems such as the vaccination passport or a French \u2018 pass sanitaire \u2019 ( which is a version of the new EU Digital Covid Certificate ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the supply and management of PPE equipment like masks , from March to October 2020 .\nAccording to a report filed by Mediapart ( independent French online investigative journal ) Accenture has been selected to make \u20ac800 million euros in savings on state services , for a mission whose amount is estimated at \u20ac25 million euros , according to the investigation .\nNot surprisingly , McKinsey managed to obtain the second part of that market whose mission was meant to achieve savings across 484 public institutions for a minimum amount of savings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe Senate report discloses some 68 orders placed by the State with various consultancy firms , for a total amount of \u20ac41.05 million Euros in fees .\nAccording to the senators , based on the billing practice of five consultancy firms , they were able to determine that individual consultants were billing the French government an estimated \u20ac2,168 per day .\nIn 2021 , more than \u20ac1 billion euros minimum in consulting expenditures for ministries and public operators was recorded ( bearing in mind the Senate Inquiry investigated only 10 % of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question remains : where did this money go , and what do we have to show for ?\nWhat was the noticeable impact on all of these supposed government cost reduction strategy ?\nConsider the following : whilst the United States is asking McKinsey to pay a compensation of $ 573 million to settle a dispute over their involvement in the disastrous opiates scandal , the French government is hiring McKinsey to run its national vaccine roll-out .\nIt is only fair for us to question the reasons why such an astounding amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these well-connected firms , and McKinsey in particular ( taking in roughly \u20ac250,000 euros per working week , \u20ac50,000 euros per day ) to do a job our Ministry of Health is more than well-equipped to undertake .\nIs the French state now ConsultoDependent ?\nThe problems do not end there .\nSeveral elected officials suspect serious conflicts of interest and close ties between certain consultancy firms and members of the government , including President Emmanuel Macron himself , who is suspected of such ties .\nIndeed , there were links during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as evidenced in a report from French media outlet LeMonde , which published a explosive article where we learn how Macron \u2019 s campaign program was written \u201c for free \u201d by 20 McKinsey employees .\nEliane Assassi ( rapporteur ) and Arnaud Bazin ( President ) of the Senate Commission inquiry reminded every one of their conclusion , that the purpose of their inquiry was not to question the use of private consulting firms , but to first assess its relevance , and to document any interference by private consulting firms into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal is to put an end to the opacity that surround the relationship between consultancy firms and our government .\nBreakdown of consulting expenses during the health crisis ( excluding Public Health France and in millions of Euros ) What was McKinsey \u2019 s role in France \u2019 s vaccination strategy ?\nLogistics Organization \u2013 Study of logistics scenarios for the distribution of vaccines , monitoring of deliveries , stocks , injections

now been forwarded to the public prosecutor .\nMcKinsey \u2019 s French turnover reached \u20ac329 million euros in 2020 , of which around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it employs around 600 employees based in the country , and yet for more than 10 years they have never paid corporate taxes in France .\nFrench Heath Minister Olivier V\u00e9ran was interviewed in February 2022 by the Senate committee on the overuse and potential influence consultancy firms such as McKinsey \u2013 who appear to control the key decision-making mechanisms relating to France \u2019 s vaccination strategy ( and other French strategic areas ) .\nWho is McKinsey in France ?\nThe company , nicknamed \u201c The Firm , \u201d apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet it is located on the Champs above a shopping mall , with a breathtaking view of Paris .\nIt has long been regarded as a company that cultivates secrecy over its 100-year history following its founding in the United States .\nAs a World Economic Forum ( WEF ) partner , McKinsey is a consulting firm for CAC40 French stock market bosses , heads of state , and government ministers .\nOn its website , the company says it is \u201c committed to the decisive transformations of its customers \u201d and \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the path Macron \u2019 s government took from 2017 onward , which appears to be streamlined with the WEF agenda known as the \u201c Great Reset , \u201d and whose coffee table publication can be found on many world leaders presidential desk .\nIt only stands to reason then that Macron \u2019 s grooming as a WEF Young Leader in Davos , Switzerland will have some influence on the direction which such sweeping government initiatives are taken .\nHow was McKinsey able to escape the French tax authorities ?\n\u201c McKinsey is indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but its payments have been zero Euros for at least 10 years \u201d , denounced the Senate Commission Inquiry into the \u201c Growing Influence of Private Consulting Firms on Public Policy.\n\u201d The documents the commission reviewed relate to the period spreading between 2011 and 2020 , and concern \u201c the two main McKinsey entities registered in France : McKinsey & Company Inc. France and McKinsey & Company SAS \u201d .\nMcKinsey uses a \u2018 tax optimization \u2019 mechanism popular with many multinationals : the declaration of the \u201c transfer prices \u201d of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company based in the state of Delaware , a registered tax haven in the US .\nThe firm ensures that many expenses such as general administration costs or the provision of personnel appear as expenses in the company \u2019 s annual accounts , and allows it to reduce its corporate taxes to zero .\nIn a July 2019 article by Politico , we learn that , \u201c For the past four years , the powerhouse firm McKinsey and Co. has helped restructure the country \u2019 s spying bureaucracy , aiming to improve response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies such as the CIA , the National Security Agency ( NSA ) and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence .\nIn this article , an insider revealed how McKinsey \u2019 s \u201c efforts have hindered decision-making at these agencies , \u201d further describing McKinsey \u2019 s efforts as collosal waste of time and money .\nAs for France , the question is whether or not McKinsey could also be used as a back door for the US intelligence agencies to gather political and economic intelligence , or influence or steer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign policies .\nMatthieu Aron and Caroline Michel-Aguirre co-author of the book \u201c Les infiltr\u00e9s \u201d published a must-read in order to understand how these consultancy firms have now seized control of the State .\nAron recently commented , \u201c It is this firm [ referring to McKinsey ] that piloted the vaccination strategy in France .\nDozens of consultants arrived at Public Health France [ Ministry of Health ] and took the place of civil servants , and decided how to organize this vaccination roll-out across the country .\nThis has never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He also points out how McKinsey , a US firm , has been awarded a strategic mission by the French Ministry of Defence \u2013 triggering new alarm bells from the national security community This has been an issue of great concern as it exposes our national security structure and defence strategies to completely unaccountable foreign agents .\nWe must question the nature of all these contracts , including why and how they were awarded .\nTherefore , it is extreme difficult to overlook the fact that McKinsey \u2019 s Associate Director Karim Tadjeddine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services contract \u2013 is a long time close colleague of French President Emmanuel Macron .\nAs it turns out , the pair have known each other for a very long time , and are likely close friends .\nTadjeddine even co-wrote a book prefaced by Emmanuel Macron , and was also very deeply involved in Macron \u2019 s 2016-2017 presidential campaign .\nMatthieu Aron added in an interview he gave to L\u00e9a Salam\u00e9 on France Inter in Feb 2022 : \u201c What we these consultancy forms fingerprints in all our ministries , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sector , and that can no longer be ignored ?\nHow can the government justify \u20ac496 000 euros spent for a report on \u201c the evaluation of the future profession of teacher \u201d or \u20ac235,000 euros for \u201c a guide to teleworking \u201d .\nIt has become systematic that the State can no longer do anything on its own without asking for a report.\n\u201d Outcomes and takeaways from such reports are extremely arguable and rightly so .\nHence , many French citizens struggle to see any benefits .\nBut what exactly are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are selling the wholesale transformation , reset and replacement strategies for ministries , under the guise of supposedly saving money and helping the administration by \u2018 remaining a competitive service provider.\n\u2019 Gabriel Attal , Macron \u2019 s government spokesperson , confirmed on the 18th March 2022 during an interview on BFMTV that they were planning to reduce their consultancy envelop and create an internal government lead consultancy desk , again claiming this was an effort to reduce cost .\nThe \u2018 Consultancy Advisory Desk \u2019 project is being led by Amelie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Transformation and Public Service , whose husband just happened to have spent 10 years in the consulting industry , at the Boston Consulting Group \u2019 s Paris offices .\nAnother coincidence ?\nIMAGE : French President Emmanuel Macron with French Minister of Transformation and Public Service , Amelie de Montchalin .\nFollowing April 2016 when Emmanuel Macron launched his political movement \u201c La Republique En Marche , \u201d barely two months later , Guillaume de Montchalin , then principal and now partner of the Boston Consulting Group , proposed in June 2016 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Emmanuel Macron takes part in one of its \u201c Office Fridays.\n\u201d The exchange was organized between the staff of the firm , and prominent personalities ( high-level entrepreneurs , philanthropists , and politicians ) .\nAccording to a \u201c Consultor \u201c article , the request was addressed to one St\u00e9phane Charbit , a person close to the campaign and current managing director at Rothschild Bank , St\u00e9phane Charbit , who then supported him with C\u00e9dric O , the treasurer of En Marche at the time \u2013 who is now Secretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was trained and groomed in the mergers & acquisitions branch of the Rothschild Bank , one might wonder if the bankers wanted to keep a tab on their very promising presidential candidate , or simply monitor their investment .\nThis is not the merely a sign of interest from strategic consulting firms .\nGuillaume Kasbarian , then manager at PMP consultancy and former consultant at Monitor , remembers being among the \u201c first 100 people to join \u201d Macron \u2019 s campaign .\n\u201c I was behind Emmanuel Macron from day one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , in 2016 , McKinsey \u2019 s Karim Tadjeddine and Emmanuel Macron were both prominent members of the Board of Directors of \u201c En Temps R\u00e9el \u201d ( In Real Time ) , a high-level French technocracy think tank which was presided over by EURO NEXT CEO St\u00e9phane Boujnah until September 2016 .\nFrom August 2014 to August 2016 , Macron was France \u2019 s Minister of Economy & Industry & Digital Affairs before assuming the presidential office on the 14 May 2017 .\nIs this incredible timetable a coincidence ?\nWho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompanies Macron from the creation the creation of his political party \u201c En Marche \u201d , to France \u2019 s national vaccination strategy ?\nIMAGE : Emmanuel Macron in a symposium co-organized by the McKinsey firm , in Paris , June 23 , 2016 .\nThe first meeting of Emmanuel Macron and McKinsey & Co in 2007 The links between Emmanuel Macron and the McKinsey firm date back to 2007 .\nEmmanuel Macron , then finance inspector , was just 29 years old .\nAt this point he became deputy general rapporteur of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French Growth , \u201d known as the Attali Commission , named after its leader , political scientist and economist Jacques Attali , regarded as a central actor in the French deep state , whose role was to propose economic reforms to then President Nicolas Sarkozy on how to modernise the government and make it \u2018 more efficient.\n\u2019 Macron impressed the audience whose members included \u00c9ric Labaye , a veteran of Macron \u2019 s Promotion X ( for those who know ) and then director of McKinsey in France .\nA former member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Le Monde who said : \u201c We met in the evening until midnight in a room in the Senate with Attali and Macron .\nIn the public seats , there were three or four young people from McKinsey .\nThey were doing simulations on Excel .\nTheir leader was so brilliant that people listened to him as if he were a full member .\nTheir manager was a man called Karim Tadjeddine.\n\u201d This series of events was definitely not a coincidence .\nThe Great Revolving Door : From McKinsey to Ministries The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper .\nAnother close collaborator of Emmanuel Macron is \u00c9ric Labaye ( image , left ) , a former Senior Partner at McKinsey & Company , and chairman of the McKinsey Global Institute known as MGI ; a strategic arm of the firm \u2019 s global economic research .\nLabaye was also the Director General of McKinsey France in 2002 .\n\u00c9ric remained with McKinsey until the 16th Sept 2018 .\nOnce Emmanuel Macron was elected in 2017 , young consultants from McKinsey were already surrounding the new President , since they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into office .\nMcKinsey partner Labaye was also Director General of Macron \u2019 s La Republique En Marche , and was eventually appointed President of Polytechnique by the Council of Ministers in August 2018 ( basically appointed by Emmanuel Macron ) .\nPolytechnique is France most prestigious engineering school .\nPerhaps \u00c9ric \u2019 s job was done \u2013 McKinsey was embedded inside the government for good , and \u00c9ric was rewarded for it with this much controversial appointment ( another scandal on its own , but I am going to skip this for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track ) Here we have a diagram of Macron \u2019 s connection with McKinsey , but also the connections between McKinsey and other governmental institutions in France and beyond .\n( NOTE : I couldn \u2019 t find the name of the person that actually drafted this diagram , it was sent to me without referenced source , but the diagram is accurate hence I am comfortable adding it here .\nThe Credit goes to him/her of course ) Considering all of this , it wasn \u2019 t much of a surprise when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launch a 4-month inquiry on McKinsey \u2019 s influence in the French state \u2019 s affairs .\nThe diagram above is the reason why the Senate talks about \u2018 sprawling connections \u2019 when speaking of McKinsey in France .\nIt seems that if the CIA had planned to infiltrate the French government ( regardless of whether or not it had done this already ) , it is now very clear that McKinsey would be their ideal point of entry .\nThe influence of McKinsey on public policy , as well as their motives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage , and the people of France are growing restless , and now they want answers .\nThus , McKinseyGate , along with the preliminary conclusions of the Senate inquiry is a State scandal and heads are expected to roll .\nAnother example of a flagrant conflict of interest is Victor Fabius , son of Laurent Fabius , President of France \u2019 s Constitutional Council , a crucial institution whose role is to shield the French citizenry from government misuse of power .\nIncredibly , Victor also just happened to work for McKinsey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Covid vaccine roll-out \u2013 despite a massive push-back from millions of French people , including 300,000 caregivers and medical staff coerced into taking the controversial vaccine in order to keep their job , and much more .\nOddly , The Constitutional Council was a no-show during the approval process of Macron \u2019 s relentless pandemic emergency bills , despite the fact that such bills were deemed by many legal experts to be unconstitutional in France , and also in the EU .\nIt \u2019 s important to reiterate that none of McKinsey \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so the question is why should they have a say in our country \u2019 s immunization policy , or housing policies , or any fundamental public policy issues in France ?\nWe are now seeing a vivid and highly disturbing picture emerge with McKinseyGate : under the auspices of the innocuous-sounding \u2018 Private Public Partnership , \u2019 we can now the formation of a shadow government in France \u2013 a veritable foreign corporate fifth column firmly installed inside the French government structure .\nBack when Macron created his political party En @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , working groups had already been set up with no less than a dozen McKinsey employees set-up for the

McKinsey \u2019 s embedded operative for the DITP contract at the time was none other than Karim Tadjeddine , the leader who had so impressed the Attali Commission , and who today finds himself at the centre of a new state scandal in France .\nFunny how it took a Senate Commission inquiry to find out that the head office of McKinsey & Company France is not registered in Paris \u2013 but in the United States , and in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convenient !\nBy now , it would not surprise many in France if McKinsey has in fact been working relentlessly in pushing along the rapid implementation of the World Economic Forum and Klaus Schwab \u2019 s \u201c Great Reset \u201d in France , as McKinsey was allowed by our own government to infiltrate the very heart of the French administration and judiciously placed at the helm of our vaccination strategy , as well as other strategic projects in areas like education defense .\nWas it Macron who chose McKinsey , or McKinsey who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Arthur Muller ( currently CEO and co-funder eXplain ) and Eric Labaye which we have already mentioned above , we must take a look back at April 2016 , the date of the creation of Emmanuel Macron \u2019 s party , En Marche , in which a dozen employees of McKinsey France were involved including senior and junior consultants who took part in fundraising dinners for Macron \u2019 s campaign in 2016 and 2017 , from London to Paris , and from Madrid to Brussels .\nWho else had a McKinsey background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the secretary \u2019 s office Digital State , comes from McKinsey \u2022 Ariane Komorn head of the LREM project department ( La Republique en Marche Macron \u2019 s political party ) , comes from McKinsey \u2022 Paul Midy general manager of LREM ( La R\u00e9pulique en Marche ) , comes from McKinsey \u2022 Martin Bohmert , the former youth president with Macron , joined McKinsey in 2020 \u2022 Ma\u00ebl de Calan , Associate partner at McKinsey since 2018 former financial director of the biotech ManRos Mathieu Maucort , former project manager at McKinsey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this phenomenon .\nHe was in charge of communications strategy in 2017 at En Marche before becoming Mounir Mahjoubi \u2019 s chief of staff at the State Secretariat for Digital , a position he still holds .\nThe relentless movement between En Marche and the state council is also a two-way street .\nSome who were not strategy consultants became so after May 2017 .\nAdditional proof of the compatibility between the two worlds : the arrival , announced at the end of September , of Emmanuel Macron \u2019 s former adviser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in strategy , specifically in the environmental sector , with business magnate Bernard Arnault , is a shining illustration of this .\nI will stop here for now , as I believe I have illustrated my case .\nOne can only wonder about the enormous weight of McKinsey in the decisions that were , and still are , taken in the management of the Covid-19 crisis in France , all done behind the opaque corporate bunker erected by Macron and McKinsey .\nDuring the early hours of the COVID pandemic , the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up a \u201c Health Defense Council , \u201d yet another layer of bureaucracy which provided the secrecy required to operate in the dark , with each participant being subject to a form of security clearance that the defense secrecy and national security apparatus afforded them .\nThis can not be a coincidence , as it ensures all meetings will be held under a non-disclosure , and a \u201c need to know basis.\n\u201d Of course , the lifting of defense secrecy layer can be requested , and legally speaking , the \u00c9lys\u00e9e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other hand , politically , the Minister of Defense will seek the approval of the President of the Republic , meaning Macron would have had the last word anyway .\nThey were working in a completely unaccountable vacuum away from all checks and balances , unfettered and at ease to do what ever they wanted .\nNormally , this would be unacceptable , but under the guise of the \u2018 global pandemic , \u2019 governments effectively suspended the normal bureaucratic and legal due processes , enjoying their newfound statutory and emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to be lifted immediately in order to restore transparency , and to see if overreach of power has been taking place .\nHere we must ask a crucial question : were these consultancy firms and vaccines manufacturers allowed in these so-called \u201c Health Defense Council Meetings \u201d ?\nWhat were the true motives behind Macron \u2019 s choice to hold these meetings under a complete veil of secrecy ?\nWhat were they hiding from the public ?\nAs the fall-out from the global vaccine roll-out continues , and the clinical trial and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pfizer comes under increased scrutiny , the case against influence peddling , corporate malfeasance , and fraud become more compelling .\nThe Senate Inquiry has just launched a debate we should have had 10 years ago , and certainly at the very start of the pandemic .\nThese consultancy firms have emptied the vault of the French republic for years , and certainly have contributed to many government cosmetic requirements , but what about the people of France ?\nWhat did we truly get out of this sweeping \u2018 reform \u2019 of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structures ?\nMcKinsey will likely be forced to pay the corporate taxes they have been avoiding for along period of time , but this doesn \u2019 t in any way address the real problem of collusion present in this very popular trend erecting a Public Private Partnership .\nThe Senate Commission Inquiry into the influence of consulting firms on public policy delivered its conclusions on Thursday March 17 , after four months of work .\nSenator \u00c9liane Assassi brings to light a \u201c sprawling phenomenon , \u201d in her words , and reveals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole sections of public policy.\n\u201d Incredibly , few outside the halls of power were even aware this silent corporate coup had been taking place .\nIn the following video , ( below , English subtitled ) , Assassi confirms having in her possession documents created by McKinsey Australia which were used to advise the Australian health ministries , before going on to explain that these very same documents were used by McKinsey France , with the only change being that the new version displayed the French Ministry of Health logo .\nShe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 to describe how McKinsey documents are being perceived as the work issued by the French Ministry of Health , when in fact it couldn \u2019 t be further from the truth .\nShe goes on saying that the McKinsey logo is even sometimes removed from documents and replaced by the logo of the French Ministry of Health .\nThe problem doesn \u2019 t even stop here , as such documents are then forwarded to the Health Defense Council who held meeting under a strict veil of secrecy forbidding the French taxpayers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and what is being discussed .\nSenator \u00c9liane Assassi talks about ethical inadequacy of this incredible farago .\nIndeed , the opacity of Macron \u2019 s government has become a trademark of his administration .\nEssentially , it \u2019 s a black box bureaucracy .\nConsidering the evidence presented earlier , it can be said that McKinsey created the Macron phenomena from scratch , with the drafting of the controversial \u201c Macron 2 \u201d law in 2015 , and the creation of his political party En Marche .\nThis is now undisputed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in eastern Europe , if one was to take a serious look at Ukraine and its government , we would find none other than McKinsey & Co. , reproducing the very same patterns with the government of Volodymyr Zelensky .\nIn this way , these two \u201c heads \u201d of state are nothing more than actors who perfectly regurgitate prefabricated scenarios scripted by McKinsey .\nMany have observed the overt level of control and influence over the government in Kiev by the US Embassy in Kiev , Victoria Nuland , and the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the western levers of control are installed inside the government itself .\nLet \u2019 s take the example of Oleksandr Danylyuk , the former Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council and Minister of Finance of Ukraine .\nUnder Zelensky \u2019 s leadership and Oleksandr Danylyuk \u2019 s close counsel , the Ukrainian Government spiraled into receivership by racking up an enormous debt with the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , and devised a deadly strategy in the Donbass region , further inflaming the violent civil war in eastern Ukraine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years in McKinsey \u2019 s offices in London and Moscow .\nHis projects included the reform of the UK tax system , as well as the development of strategies and the optimization of operations in the energy and telecommunications sectors .\nMoreover , Danylyuk and McKinsey developed the strategy for the Economic Reform Coordination Center of Ukraine .\nThe firm drafted the cooperation agreement with the IMF , and it was Danylyuk who actively supported the signing of the EU-Ukraine association agreement , despite active opposition within the government from the pro-Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , as McKinsey \u2019 s fingerprints are everywhere to be seen , including their timely intervention behind the curtain to stop the Germany and Russia \u2019 s joint Nord Stream 2 pipeline project .\nAgain , it was Oleksandr Danyliuk , Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine , who could be heard saying on several occasions that , \u201c We see Nord Stream 2 as a security threat.\n\u201d \u201c Poland , the United States and Ukraine consider the North Stream 2 gas pipeline a threat to national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danyliuk .\nWhere the EU procures its energy supplies wouldn \u2019 t normally be of interest to a country like Ukraine , but it is a central issue for realizing Washington and London foreign policy objectives .\nIndeed , Danyliuk \u2019 s comments echo far , and today we can see the obvious results when observing the United States and the European Commission \u2019 s new commitment to severely reducing Europe \u2019 s dependence on Russian energy .\nTheir last Joint statement made during Biden \u2019 s visit to Brussels is a clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on More Affordable , Secure and Sustainable Energy ( REPowerEU ) , the EU has confirmed its goal of becoming completely independent of Russian fossil fuels .\nAs for the US , they will without a shadow of a doubt , take advantage of the situation and try to increase their more expensive LNG gas exports to Europe in an attempt to replace Russian fuel .\nThe White House announcement on the 26th March 2022 confirms the U.S. intention to rapidly increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe as Germany and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to diminish their dependence on Russian fossil fuels .\nIn many ways , this recent overhaul of European energy policy is also harmonizing with the World Economic Forum \u2019 s \u201c Great Reset \u201d agenda , and stakeholder governments \u2019 \u201c Net Zero \u201d decarbonisation commitments .\nHere we can remind you again , that McKinsey & Co. is the top strategic advisor to the WEF .\nTheir proximity with the drug and vaccine manufacturers provides room for more conflict of interest to take place .\nIf only it ended there .\nAccording @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm is also supporting major players in the pharmaceutical and medical devices industry to help them anticipate changes in the sector , design innovative approaches and develop the skills that will guarantee their \u2018 sustainable performance \u2019 and more profitable growth .\nFor instance , Aamir Malik , Pfizer \u2019 s Executive Vice President and Chief Business Innovation Officer , is responsible for the company \u2019 s strategy and business development .\nBut looking into his professional experience , we discover he was the Managing Partner of McKinsey & Company \u2019 s United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm \u2019 s Global Pharmaceutical and Medical Products Practice .\nA Senior executive of McKinsey at Pfizer should trigger a lot of alarm bells , especially knowing McKinsey was appointed by Macron \u2019 s government and the French Ministry of Health to plan and implement the national vaccination strategy .\nWho would be naive enough to believe there isn \u2019 t any conflict of interest here ?\nWas the COVID-19 pandemic the most lucrative Public Private Partnership ever conceived ?\nAnd why are we left with the feeling this was all orchestrated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask yourself , how is it that McKinsey , Macron , and Zelensky are all active members of the World Economic Forum ?\nIn the modern era , transparency and accountability in government have long been regarded as the very pillars of our democracy , and today I can say with confidence that France , my beautiful country , has been the victim of a coup d \u2019 \u00e9tat beginning in 2017 , when a group of conspirators helped Macron ascending to the throne , and with the help of very unscrupulous individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representatives , they promoted and implemented a pernicious agenda spearheaded by the World Economic Forum in Davos and a powerful transnational pharmaceutical lobby , and drafted by the McKinsey-Accenture corporate bloc .\nMcKinseyGate has only just begun .\nPLEASE HELP SUPPORT OUR INDEPENDENT MEDIA PLATFORM HERE",

revelations of this entire conflict so far .\nOne of the main grievances Russia had with Ukraine was the fact that it was being groomed for NATO membership \u2013 a national security risk which Moscow deemed as completely unacceptable .\nYesterday , the Wall Street Journal revealed how German chancellor Olaf Scholz had offered Ukraine \u2019 s President Volodymyr Zelensky a peace deal only days before Russia launched its \u201c Special Military Operations \u201d in Ukraine on February 24th .\nBut Zelensky turned down the deal \u2013 claiming that Putin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his promises .\nIt turns out that Scholz was in the process of brokering a deal and told Zelensky during his visit to the Munich Security Conference on February 19th , \u201c that Ukraine should renounce its NATO aspirations and declare neutrality as part of a wider European security deal between the West and Russia , \u201d and that \u201c the pact would be signed by Mr. Putin and Mr. Biden , who would jointly guarantee Ukraine \u2019 s security.\n\u201d Incredibly , Zelensky rejected the offer to make a concession by declaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war with Russia , and claimed that , \u201c Putin couldn \u2019 t be trusted to uphold such an agreement and that most Ukrainians wanted to join NATO.\n\u201d This revelation really exposes two key points .\nFirstly , that as a head of state , Zelensky is either grossly incompetent or completely reckless to needlessly place his country on the path to war with its neighbour .\nSecondly , it indicates the level of control that Washington has over his government , as he is being advised at every step of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CIA .\nIt \u2019 s no secret that the US and UK have been egging-on Kiev to fight NATO \u2019 s war with Russia on their behalf \u2013 even if that means placing Kiev into an unwinnable position where it may end up having its armed forces completely destroyed , and Ukraine losing even more territory than it already has .\nMaybe Zelensky could have defused tensions 6 months ago by disavowing NATO aspirations and declaring Ukraine a neutral state .\nSuch a declaration would certainly be welcome by Russia today , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued proxy war against Moscow , and the US and UK-led campaign to \u2018 cancel \u2019 Russia from the global economic and financial system , as well as media , culture and sport , then it \u2019 s safe to

reason is an uncomfortable one for Brussels : Hungary has broken ranks with the EU \u2018 consensus \u2019 on Russia and Ukraine , as the Orban government confirms it is now ready to pay for Russian natural gas in rubles .\nHungary has also opposed any EU sanctions on Russian oil and gas , and has forbid any NATO arms shipments passing through Hungarian territory on its way to the war zone in Ukraine .\nThe EU has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Russia supplies the EU with approximately one-third of its total gas supplies .\nHowever , Brussels has yet to apply any sanctions on oil or gas from Russia , as unelected bureaucrats from the European Council continue to struggle implementing any ban Russian gas and oil .\nEU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has announced that introducing a total ban on

.\n\u201c It \u2019 s not about putting on a sweater at night , or turning down the heating a little or paying a bit more for gas , it \u2019 s about the fact that if there is no energy coming from Russia , Hungary will be left with no energy at all , \u201d said Orban .\nNevertheless , Borell stressed the importance of EU countries becoming less reliant on Russian energy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c

now face the opposite problem .\nInflation is back .\nThe rise in inflation reflects the rapid and goods-intensive economic recovery from the Covid-19-induced recession \u2013 bolstered by highly accommodative fiscal and monetary policy \u2013 which supply has been unable to fully meet .\nWe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as many of the forces behind high inflation remain in place and new ones are

policy rates to more appropriate levels .\nThe world economy must learn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A new era of higher inflation and interest rates is impending as traditional ties between Western countries on one side , and Russia and China on the other , are deteriorating , while the impact of the coronavirus pandemic is driving globalization into reverse , said the head of the Bank for International

.\n\u201c We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the inflationary environment is changing fundamentally , \u201d Carstens added .\nAnd \u201c if my thesis is correct , central banks will need to adjust \u201d .\nThe warning comes amid spiking prices for energy and food that are pushing year-on-year inflation in over half of developed economies soaring above 5 % , while half of the developing world is expected to face inflation of over 7 % .\nMeanwhile , major economies were forced to raise interest rates from all-time lows .\nThe supply chain crisis that was sparked by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitably worsened by the latest conflict between Russia and Ukraine , sending living costs around the world skyrocketing .\nThe immediate implication would be that policymakers would have to quickly shift their \u201c

first round of the French presidential election will begin this weekend , and it \u2019 s now clear that Emmanuel Macron \u2019 s lead over his rivals , namely Marine Le Pen , is seriously slipping .\nBased on today \u2019 s poll numbers , both front runners Macron and Le Pen are slated to make it to the second-round run-off stage \u2013 a repeat of the country \u2019 s 2017 presidential run .\nWhat has caused Macron \u2019 s popularity to tank in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago he was a heavy favourite for re-election , but in recent weeks he has been ensnared in the hugely damaging McKinsey scandal , as well as his failure to chart any meaningful course on France \u2019 s response to the situation in Ukraine .\nEarly on Macron was trying to play the peacemaker and shuttle diplomat with Moscow , and has ended up panicking as NATO and French special forces officers have been exposed fighting alongside Nazi battalions in battle zones like Mariupol .\nMs Le Pen \u2019 s success has come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate Eric Zemmour , whose early hype has died down , making him a mere footnote by now .\nRounding out the field is anti-establishment left-wing candidate , Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon , who is now in third place with around 15 % of the vote .\nEven the pro-globalist Washington Post is openly admitting that right-wing Marine Le Pen is now trending stronger than incumbent Macron : More than a month ago , French President Emmanuel Macron \u2019 s reelection seemed a certainty .\nHe comfortably led in the polls ahead of rivals to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public watched in shock as Russian forces poured into Ukraine .\nMacron \u2019 s main challenger , far-right perennial Marine Le Pen , was hobbled by her historic rapport with the regime of Russian President Vladimir Putin and stated admiration for his approach to governance .\nA second-round runoff against either Le Pen or far-left candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon , another figure with a dim view of NATO and a perceived friendliness toward Putin , was bound to be a formality .\nMacron , who came to power in 2017 as a radical centrist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play a more assertive role on the European stage , embraced the part of continental statesman .\n\u201c People always rally around a wartime leader , \u201d Nicholas Dungan , a senior fellow of the Atlantic Council , told my colleague Rick Noack .\n\u201c The leadership by Macron is completely consistent with the image the French have of what their country should be doing : It \u2019 s a global power , it needs to be listened to , it should be aiming for peace.\n\u201d As Sunday \u2019 s first-round vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sweat .\nHe will likely finish at the top of the pack , but polls now show a statistical toss-up between him and Le Pen should they face each other in the second round on April 24 .\n\u201c It \u2019 s one minute to midnight , \u201d former prime minister Manuel Valls wrote in a column in French weekly Le Journal du Dimanche .\n\u201c Marine Le Pen could be elected president of the republic.\n\u201d Le Pen has closed the gap on Macron no matter the bad odor of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her supporters had even circulated a campaign leaflet showing her shaking Putin \u2019 s hand \u2014 and the frequent broadsides from Macron \u2019 s camp .\nFrench Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Thursday that , in a France led by Le Pen , \u201c there would be less sovereignty because we would be allies of Russia , of Vladimir Putin.\n\u201d The reality is Le Pen has surged on the back of voter concerns that have little to do with the geopolitics of ending the war in Ukraine .\n\u201c Polls show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the cost of living has increased under Macron \u2019 s presidency , even as the economy overall has weathered the coronavirus pandemic and other crises , \u201d my colleagues explained .\n\u201c The war in Ukraine has prompted growing concerns over rising inflation , surging energy prices and insufficient pensions.\n\u201d Le Pen , who lost in a landslide to Macron in 2017 , has tried to detoxify her and her party \u2019 s image as one steeped in neo-fascist resentments , racism and anti-Semitism .\nShe was aided by the maverick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose snarling anti-immigrant , anti-establishment rhetoric has made Le Pen \u2014 a far-right mainstay for years \u2014 look comparatively moderate .\nAnd her campaign has waved the banner of economic populism as much as it also tries to harness far-right cultural anxieties .\nLe Pen condemned the invasion of Ukraine as a violation of international law and has welcomed Ukrainian refugees .\n\u201c She was able to change her brand image , \u201d David Dubois , professor of digital marketing at Insead , a leading business school , told the Financial Times .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to change her discourse from immigration to rising prices and how to increase the purchasing power of French people.\n\u201d Contrast that with Macron , who has throughout his five years in power been viewed as an aloof elitist \u2014 a \u201c Jupiterian \u201d president , as the French put it , ensconced in his Olympian abode .\nThe former investment banker is attacked both by Le Pen and his critics to the left as an effete figure ruling for the rich , disconnected from the concerns of ordinary French workers .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a right-leaning British publication , Le Pen cast Macron as an agent of global capital .\n\u201c The policies I want to implement are not meant for the stock markets , which will be a change from Emmanuel Macron , \u201d she said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not the markets that create jobs , it \u2019 s not international finance.\n\u201d ( \u2026 ) She claimed Macron \u2019 s objective is \u201c to

\u2019 ve all been dreading .\nWe are already living within an oppressive , restrictive faux-communist society based on digital control and progressing rapidly towards a complete lack of individuality and freedom .\nAnyone who denies this is either very , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid , or bought-and-paid-for and part of the nightmare .\nMost people , the collaborators , are dead , but don \u2019 t realise it yet .\nThis is the laxative video ( see below ) I never wanted to have to make .\nEverything is now happening very rapidly .\nAnyone who is surprised at rising prices and rising inflation obviously didn \u2019 t watch my videos a year ago .\nJust about everything significant that is happening to us was predictable .\nInflation is not going to stop at 10 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbing mortgage loans at

% and now seems to be nicely settled at 50 % .\nLook at Germany just under a century ago and see how inflation brought about real political changes .\nIn this video I \u2019 m going to provide the proof that the Great Reset is much further along than most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show that everything that has been happening during the last two years \u2013 the covid fraud , the net zero fraud , the sanctions against Russia , the transgender controversy \u2013 is part of the plan leading the world into the biggest recession since the 1930s \u2013 as I \u2019 ve been predicting for longer than I like to remember \u2013 and possibly worse than that .\nClosing down Russia \u2019 s access to its dollars will cost us all huge amounts of money .\nThe New World Order is already here @ @ @ @ @ @ @

conspirators who control the sort of people who believe that gluing themselves to the road in front of ambulances is a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of people who think that those of us who worry about what is happening are half crazed conspiracy theorists .\nBut the odd thing is that most of those people who think we are conspiracy theorists are themselves concerned about things that are happening and that have affected them .\nThe problem is that they haven \u2019 t looked at the big picture \u2013 they don \u2019 t realise that all the bad things that have been happening in the last few years are all connected .\nCovid-19 , global warming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war against us , the deliberately destroyed global economy , the price rises , the inflation \u2013 they are all linked .\nThe innocents have

no one in the media is concerned about what is happening in Syria or Yemen where far more people have been killed in wars .\nThe answer , of course , is that Russia has the oil and gas and sanctions

\u2019 m not trying to scare you , I \u2019 m not being dramatic .\nI \u2019 m telling you the truth .\nIf you think I \u2019 m exaggerating , please remember , I \u2019 ve been absolutely accurate about everything that \u2019 s happened .\nIn 2004 , I wrote a book called Why Everything Is Going to Get Worse .\nI was warning about compulsory vaccination programmes and the attacks on the elderly over a decade ago .\nJust under two years ago I warned about the danger of digital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abuse of DNR notices in hospitals , the use of the useless PCR tests to collect DNA samples \u2013 that was denied until companies admitted selling the DNA they were harvesting \u2013 and the use of the lockdowns to kill millions worldwide .\nA year ago I warned that food and fuel prices would go up .\nToday they are going up almost daily and there \u2019 s much profiteering I \u2019 m afraid .\nPeople laughed when I warned that inflation and interest rates would rocket .\nLook what \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much that the interest on the nation \u2019 s debt costs \u00a383 billion a year .\nYour taxes are spent paying the interest \u2013 let alone the capital .\nThe conspirators have been following a play book .\nThey \u2019 ve used brain washing and propaganda to take over the world and it hasn \u2019 t been difficult to work out what comes next .\nThe war is a ruthless , brutal , propaganda war fought with the aid of communist techniques and psy-op tricks devised by the CIA and the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manuals to see what they \u2019 re doing and what they \u2019 re planning .\nTwo years ago I provided the evidence that even the Government \u2019 s advisors knew that covid was no worse than the flu .\nBack in 2020 , I provided evidence about the side effects \u2013 including myocarditis and clots \u2013 of the covid jabs .\nThe sneerers had fun with that but my warnings were absolutely accurate .\nEvery time I \u2019 ve revealed more truths , the censorship has been tightened up .\nTelling the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 ve been censored for many years but the censorship has dramatically increased since the covid fraud began early in 2020 .\nWikipedia and Google demonised me with lies and I \u2019 ve been completely banned by all the mainstream media and publishers .\nI \u2019 ve been banned by YouTube \u2013 which even banned me from accessing their site \u2013 by Facebook \u2013 which two years ago said I was a danger to their community \u2013 by Twitter , by Linkedin and by every other social media outlet .\nThey all claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite .\nThey censor , they crush and they de-platform .\nThey are the enemy .\nIncidentally , Google and YouTube have been placed on a red list for child safety because they are endangering children through their censorship .\nAll of these corrupt sites have banned me permanently for the simple crime of telling the truth and being absolutely accurate .\nFor them to claim they represent free speech is like Wikipedia claiming it \u2019 s an encyclopaedia when I believe it \u2019 s more of a protection racket ( give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change an entry accordingly ) or a platform for government-controlled lies and misdirection .\nThe Royal Society of Arts expelled me as a Fellow .\nI believe that a BBC employee had complained because I \u2019 d been telling the truth .\nI can see that the BBC might find that rather shocking .\nSharing important truths about covid and global warming can get you into big trouble with the covid nutters and the misinformed and insane global warming alarmists .\nGovernments claim to have been following the science but that , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportions and I can only assume that the science has been under the control of Baron Munchausen .\nThe 77th brigade , the CIA and government sponsored hacks go round the internet putting lies and abuse and even death threats wherever they see my name .\nAnd not just me , of course .\nThere are fake sites in my name on social media and although the companies running the platforms know the sites are fake they won \u2019 t take them down .\nI have no social media presence .\nAnything in @ @ @

platform out of the UK so that I could continue to make videos here .\nI \u2019 m forever grateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by hackers thousands of times a month \u2013 every month .\nWhy would the authorities want to silence me if I weren \u2019 t telling truths they want suppressed ?\nWhy won \u2019 t they debate these issues ?\nWhy does the BBC openly refuse to allow any debate about vaccination for example ?\nLook at the facts about things which are happening .\nFirst , the covid jab .\nThe UK Government now , at last , openly admits that the symptoms of covid \u2013 the re-branded flu \u2013 are the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut the threat of compulsory vaccination hasn \u2019 t gone away .\nAnd yet the UK Government released a report showing that the fully jabbed account for 92 % of all covid 19 deaths .\nThe number of deaths among the jabbed is rising \u2013 but falling among the un-jabbed .\nThe triple jabbed are the people most likely to die .\nThey seem to be acquiring induced Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome .\nAs predicted a year or more ago , the jabs are now shown to be adversely affecting immune systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infection and cancer .\nI was scorned and attacked for warning about that .\nFigures in Canada show that the triple jabbed are five times as likely to die of covid as are the un-jabbed .\nIn the US , figures from the CDC reveal that the jabs have killed 61,000 people aged 25 to 44 .\nThat \u2019 s 3,000 more than the number of Americans who died in the Vietnam War and more than ten times as many as have died in Ukraine .\nInsurance industry experts expect 84 % excess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ database of 11 million people shows a huge increase in illness as a result of the jabs .\nAmerican figures show that covid jabs have increased miscarriages by 1,517 % if given during pregnancy .\nThe figures are all online but don \u2019 t expect to see them on the BBC site which has about as much connection with reality as a Dr Who plot .\nBought and paid for doctors in the UK are now getting richer jabbing five-year-olds with the poison .\nIn the US , 800,000 children aged 5 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to miss school after they suffered

covid jab for 5-year-olds has been added to the mass of vaccines being given they \u2019 ll keep on jabbing and add the covid jab to the schedule .\nNo one has ever bothered to find out how these vaccines interact or what damage they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my book on vaccines \u2013 it \u2019 s called Anyone who tells you vaccines are safe and effective is lying .\nEverything in it is absolutely accurate , and no one will debate the scary contents .\nThe book and I are banned by the BBC of course \u2013 and the rest of the mainstream media .\nAn MP who dared to stand up in the House of Commons and mention vaccine damage was shouted down faster than if he \u2019 d said that a woman \u2019 s place is in the home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe same sort of thing has happened in America .\nAnyone , anywhere in the world , who quotes their own government \u2019 s figures is denounced as a conspiracy theorist and an anti-vaxxer .\nThe attack articles are written by na\u00efve and ignorant journalists who know nothing and who never dare debate their ignorance .\nThe World Health Organisation is proposing a new pandemic treaty which will give it power to force countries and their citizens to do as they are told .\nThat \u2019 s the start of a world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd self-spreading vaccines are on the way .\nChina has closed down just about everything in the absurd belief they can permanently eradicate the rebranded flu .\nNo one could be stupid enough to believe that .\nIt \u2019 s all part of the destruction that will enable them to complete the Great Reset .\nChina is a vital part of the global supply chain .\nGoodbye to that .\nAnd then , of course , there is \u2018 long covid \u2019 .\nIt \u2019 s one of the major reasons nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two ago there were over one million people off work in the UK with long covid \u2013 two thirds of them off work for more than a year .\nNow the number is rapidly approaching two million .\nBut the evidence shows that long covid is a psychological disease not a physical problem .\nIt is a combination of hypochondria and malingering but it is being heavily promoted by governments because it \u2019 s an excellent way to destroy economies around the world .\nOddly , long covid seems rare among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council staff .\nI bet it \u2019 s commonest among the idiots who \u2019 ve been jabbed .\nRemember : research has proved that long covid isn \u2019 t a physical disease \u2013 it \u2019 s a psychological problem .\nGovernments have created and promoted long covid because it \u2019 s a great way to bugger up the economy and create an ever deeper recession .\nIt \u2019 s also a good way to cover up the damage done by the toxic covid jabs .\nAnd , paradoxically , promoting long covid helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bizarrely , they believe the jabs will stop them getting long covid .\nPoliticians and journalists and self-appointed fact-checkers don \u2019 t bother with accurate research when it \u2019 s inconvenient \u2013 which it always is these days .\nSecond , consider the global warming hoax .\nThe only thing warm about this nonsense is the hot air produced by pseudo-scientists , crooked politicians and bent journalists .\nLike covid , global warming is based on yet more fake science \u2013 which politicians and journalists won \u2019 t debate in public .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ no science to support their absurd claims \u2013 global warming is leading us to the absurdity of net zero and to billions of deaths .\nAnd , by the way , the recycling scam was never anything more than an exercise in forced compliance .\nI \u2019 ve always refused to play the recycling game \u2013 just as I don \u2019 t pay the BBC licence fee .\nThe global warming hoax is giving them the opportunity to get rid of fossil fuels and replace them with hydrogen \u2013 which is made with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get rid of petrol and diesel cars and replace them with electric cars which are worse for the environment and which use electricity created with oil and gas and trees chopped up into pellets , imported and burnt instead of coal .\nAnd it is giving them an excuse to force 15 million house owners in the UK to make such massive and ruinously expensive changes to their homes that the only practical solution will be to knock down perfectly good , solid homes .\nThe homeless will be forced into new , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centres .\nDon \u2019 t believe me ?\nCheck it out .\nIt \u2019 s all happening .\nAnd every new flat has a smart meter fitted .\nIf you don \u2019 t have a smart meter fitted you have to pay top prices for your electricity .\nBelieve me , it \u2019 s happening already .\nThird , the war in Ukraine .\nThe war was blatantly triggered by NATO and the world duly introduced utterly absurd sanctions against Russia , and those sanctions have deliberately and predictably destroyed economies everywhere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices and created shortages which will lead to hundreds of millions of deaths in Africa and Asia .\nIf that \u2019 s not genocide then we need a new word for it .\nFertiliser prices have quadrupled in no time at all and are now at their highest level ever .\nAfrica relies on Russia for 70 % of its fertiliser so the politicians who introduced those sanctions will kill a thousand times as many people as Putin .\nOh , and by the way , instead of the Russian gas , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the US \u2013 gas that was produced using polluting fracking techniques .\nAnd Poland and China are replacing their missing gas with coal .\nThe result is that the annual coal consumption is around 8.5 billion tons \u2013 a figure that has hardly moved in years .\nFourth , the destruction of the economy , through the sanctions , the absurd long covid , the deadly jabs , the massive debts built up as a result of the multi-billion pound covid frauds and the wicked nonsense of the global warming fraud is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recession \u2013 far bigger than the recession of the 1930s .\nA covid vaccine festival held in London cost \u00a3500 for every jab given .\nWhat an obscene waste of money .\nEven the World Bank , a bad organisation , has warned that the Ukraine war and sanctions will slow growth and increase poverty .\nNo one in government or media cares .\nIt \u2019 s all deliberate , of course .\nMillions will lose their jobs and never work again .\nLast year alone , 17,000 chain store shops closed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The basic income scheme already being trialed in Wales will spread , and the middle and working classes will disappear to be replaced by armies of forgotten and put upon drones .\nWorld trade and globalisation will soon be a thing of the past .\nThe UK will suffer more than most countries .\nAnd thanks to that nasty oik , Trudeau in Canada your savings aren \u2019 t safe .\nThe word distrain is now fashionable .\nIt means that the Government has the right to steal your assets and close your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and share the truth .\nPrices are soaring and they \u2019 ll keep going up .\nThe British Chancellor , Rishi Sunak , who gets my prize as one of the most evil men in Britain for his mal treatment of pensioners and his wife \u2019 s curious attitude to taxes and sanctions , has done more than his bit to win a seat on the world government .\nMortgage rates will go up , petrol retailers are profiteering , household energy prices are soaring beyond comprehension , food inflation went over 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will soon be no more than a memory , clothing and shoes went up 8.8 % , pub and restaurant prices will soon be beyond people who are not called Sunak and who do not enjoy the financial delights of a rich father-in-law and lots of clever advice on cutting the family tax bill , council taxes are rising as fast as services are deteriorating , train prices will average a 9.8 % rise this year , stamps went up over 10 % , furniture is up 9.2 % and subscriptions everywhere are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rationing in Germany and if you \u2019 re not in Germany they \u2019 ll be talking about it round your way soon .\nFactories are going to close .\nStreet lights will go off .\nMeanwhile , as MPs enjoy massive pay rises we pensioners are denied the pay rise we were promised by the Government .\nSunak is more dangerous to pensioners than midazolam .\nAnd anyone who hoped to supplement their miserable state pension with their own investments or pension fund will be unlucky .\nThe people who control big investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trillion in assets are making decisions based not on investment logic but on their moral values .\nSo , they are selling ( or refusing to invest in ) companies which they consider to be in some way unethical \u2013 for example , oil companies or mining companies .\nAnd they won \u2019 t even invest in companies which sell petrol .\nThis nonsense isn \u2019 t confined to so-called ethical investment funds .\nThese massively overpaid investment managers are steadfastly destroying pensions and investments and helping to impoverish everyone except themselves .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens at once ?\nIf you think that then you need to join the queue at your GPs , grab a repeat prescription and keep on taking the tablets .\nFifth , the disappearance of cash is accelerating .\nAnother coincidence ?\nNot likely .\nThanks to the enthusiasm of the dim-witted collaborators who are still wearing their stupid masks , there are now fewer shops which will take cash .\nIt \u2019 s almost impossible to buy petrol or diesel without using plastic .\nThe collaborators love their little cards because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s leading .\nAnd as I warned last year , the Bank of England is introducing its own version of bitcoin .\nBut this one is special .\nIt \u2019 s all part of the digital currency world and the digital ID they \u2019 re forcing on us .\nThey \u2019 re going to fix the fake currency so that you can \u2019 t use it to buy booze if you are an alcoholic , you can \u2019 t buy chocolate if you \u2019 re overweight , no fast cars or racing bikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t buy anything if you \u2019 re considered a bad person .\nOh , and the digital currency will make it very easy for you to pay all your taxes and utility debts because they \u2019 ll just help themselves to whatever they want .\nWho is a bad person ?\nAnyone who doesn \u2019 t have their jab or wear their mask .\nAnyone who watches this video .\nAnd they \u2019 ll know you \u2019 re watching it , of course .\nAnd it \u2019 s too late to turn off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might as well keep watching .\nTalking of masks , did you see that Dr Jenny Harries , head of the UK Health Security Agency says that she will still a wear a mask in shops and on trains .\nThat \u2019 s odd because back in March 2020 , another Dr Jenny Harries , who was at the time , Deputy Chief Medical Officer warned that it is possible to trap the virus in a mask and start breathing it in .\nThat Dr Jenny Harries said that wearing a mask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , look at what has happened to health care .\nThe bureaucrats who control health care as if they own it are driven by a hatred and contempt for us .\nThere are more bureaucrats in the health service in the UK than there are nurses and beds .\nThey mostly have expensive private health insurance .\nThere is , effectively , no GP service in the UK .\nDoctors insist on providing treatment by phone even though it has been proved beyond doubt to be unsafe .\nThat \u2019 s why the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are waiting hours for an ambulance .\nIt \u2019 s why they stopped measuring waiting times in accident and emergency departments when they went over nine hours .\nIt \u2019 s why over 12 million people are or soon will be on urgent waiting lists and why they will probably never be scanned , X-rayed or treated .\nIt \u2019 s why death rates are soaring .\nMedical care is far worse than it was in the 1950s .\nDeaths from untreated sepsis are soaring .\nHospital staff wear masks and practise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ever .\nI went in one in Wales and wiped my feet when I left .\nType 2 diabetes is treated with drugs instead of diet because it \u2019 s quicker and easier \u2013 even though it \u2019 s more dangerous and more expensive .\nNurses are allowed to prescribe .\nCare assistants , with little or no training , have taken over work that nurses should be doing because the nurses are doing things that doctors should be doing .\nCharges will soon be introduced to see a GP because most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of jabbing that for tax reasons they \u2019 re working three-day weeks .\nAnd don \u2019 t think things are getting better .\nBefore the fake pandemic , UK ministers promised to speed up cancer diagnoses so that Britain would catch up with the rest of the world .\nBut that \u2019 s been abandoned .\nMPs have warned that just half of the patients with cancer are diagnosed at stage one or two .\nAnd , they say , things are going to get worse .\nSeventh , look at education .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-time low among teenagers .\nMost school leavers can not add up without a calculator and can not read or write their own language fluently .\nThe incidence of mental health problems among children of all ages is also at an all-time high .\nIf you think this is all still a coincidence , then keep taking those tablets .\nSchool teachers and their unions cooperated in destroying the nation \u2019 s education system by closing schools unnecessarily and by insisting that children be damaged with deadly and useless masks .\nA record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for serious mental health issues .\nIf they \u2019 re lucky they might get an appointment to see someone in 10 or 15 years \u2019 time .\nAnd I hope you don \u2019 t think I \u2019 m kidding .\nAn official OFSTED report exposed how the covid-19 policy had devastated children \u2019 s lives and hindered their development .\nTeachers and doctors and social workers and politicians should be arrested .\nBut no one will be punished .\nWe live according to Schwab \u2019 s rules now .\nEighth , you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been provided by the churches .\nNot a bit of it .\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury and the Pope both need defrocking and locking up .\nThey have betrayed the people they \u2019 re supposed to care for .\nThe closure of churches and the removal of spiritual comfort at a time when people needed it most , was not just unnecessary and cowardly \u2013 in my opinion it was evil .\nThe disappearance of traditional religion was all part of the plan , of course .\nCheck it out .\nSee the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You \u2019 ll find Tony Blair in there somewhere .\nThey don \u2019 t bother keeping any of it secret .\nNinth , the increase in immigration is all part of the overall plan to homogenise cultures and destroy national identities .\nCheck that out .\nIt \u2019 s all in the plan and as far as the enemy is concerned it \u2019 s going well .\nTenth , those who think that the transgender controversy is an isolated problem still haven \u2019 t woken up properly .\nConfusion is everywhere but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all for women \u2019 s sport .\nI don \u2019 t care what Johnson may have said \u2013 transgender athletes are the future because that \u2019 s the future the conspirators have chosen for us .\nCheck it out .\nMeanwhile , everyone is suffering .\nThe basic principle of the Metaverse is that people can choose who they want to be .\nIt \u2019 s all part of the Great Reset : destroy families and traditional rights and freedoms .\nA transgender cyclist was harassed and demonised and refused permission to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had provided medical evidence that she was eligible .\nWomen fighting for single sex this or single sex that

separate cause then you \u2019 re wrong again .\nGetting rid of statues and history is all part of the conspirators \u2019 plan to erase national identities .\nIf the demonstrators really cared about black lives they \u2019 d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths in Africa .\nHow many of the moronic sports people who kneel before matches are even aware that millions of children are starving to death because of what has happened in the last two years ?\nRacism and sexism are now ingrained in our society \u2013 but not in the way you might think .\nWhite males aren \u2019 t even considered for top jobs these days .\nTwelfth , there \u2019 s the cancel culture nonsense which is being used by the lefty nutters to silence the truth-tellers .\nThey claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covid , climate change and so on must be an extreme right-winger .\nLook at what is happening in the media .\nI doubt if the BBC , which has a financial link to the discredited Bill Gates , has broadcast a truth for years .\nIn my view , the whole corrupt organisation spreads deceits , misinformation and lies to the trusting and the gullible .\nThe whole of the mainstream media has been bought with millions of dollars and pounds .\nOur money , of course .\nCheck it out .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalists and brought in hundreds of left wing snowflakes who were so stupid , greedy and bigoted that they were easy to corrupt .\nThe BBC recruited a gazillion really stupid Guardian reading communists to replace the proper journalists .\nNo one at the BBC , ITV , Sky or any other mainstream channel TV or radio channel will dare to broadcast the truth .\nI \u2019 ve been challenging them for two years .\nSilence .\nThey \u2019 re prejudiced and bent .\nNo honesty and no guts .\nThey steadfastly refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of the big issues .\nWhy ?\nIf they believed what they say , surely they \u2019 d be eager to prove that they were right in a national , live , network debate .\nMedia doctors around the world have been making big money promoting the lies .\nAnyone with a PhD in something calls themselves doctor and makes big money .\nAnd the sneaks are everywhere \u2013 they can now download an app onto their damned smart phones to use as a speed camera .\nI hope those who use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ click their heels .\nThese days everyone working for the taxpayer \u2013 civil servants , broadcasters , journalists , teachers , doctors and the rest of them \u2013 are working from home , hiding in cupboards , on strike or enjoying long covid and looking forward to a summer on the beach .\nEverything they are doing is opposed to individuality , rights , freedom .\nIt \u2019 s vital to remember that these are not separate policies \u2013 they are different tentacles of an octopus which wants to suffocate us , crush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe Germans have a word for it \u2013 schlimmbesserung \u2013 so-called improvements that make things worse .\nThis is schlimmbesserung on steroids with added nuts and double whipped cream .\nIf we want to survive we have to prepare for a permanent revolution , to fight hard to stop what is already happening and to reverse things that have happened and to stop things that

option .\nAnd we have to remember that if they are oppressing and demonising us then we have to be doing something right .\nIgnore the distractions and the side issues and concentrate on the one , big

experience \u2018 flu-like \u2019 symptoms , others may become temporarily or permanently paralysed .\nThe term \u2018 polio \u2019 is a description of spinal pathology : an inflammation of the grey marrow ( polio muelos ) of the brain stem and spinal cord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fever , vomiting , bowel irritation , back pain , neck stiffness , problems with swallowing and breathing , paralysis , and death .\nPoliovirus is an enterovirus that is activated in the human gut .\nThe corporate science machine maintains that it is a dangerous pathogen spread by infected faecal matter but Dr Suzanne Humphries explains in her book , Dissolving Illusions , that it is a naturally occurring common bowel irritant that existed for millennia before it began crippling people \u2014 which poses the question : what changed ?\nOne factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other neurological conditions such as Parkinson \u2019 s disease .\nPolio incidence and pesticide usage closely correlate ; if you plot them on a graph , they follow the same lines .\nWhat came to be known as polio was once called \u2018 summer diarrhoea \u2019 because local outbreaks occurred after crop spraying had taken place in the spring .\nChildren played in contaminated soils and ate unwashed fruit ; their parents reported finding them paralysed in apple orchards .\nHigh consumption of sugary foods in the summer lowered immunity by suppressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect environment for toxic pesticides to interact with viruses in the gut and cause illness .\nPoor diet increased susceptibility to poliovirus infection \u2013 especially a diet full of refined sugar , white flour , and processed foods , which were introduced to the public during the industrial revolution , around the time that polio began to emerge .\nBritish physician Michael Underwood first observed \u2018 debility of the lower extremities \u2019 in children in 1789 .\nIt was the height of the industrial and agricultural revolutions in Europe and pesticide use skyrocketed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as lead and arsenic .\nLead and arsenic bind tightly to soil and do not deteriorate ; they remain within the first 12-18 inches of topsoil for generations and contaminate waterways .\nRedevelopment of former rural sites without proper clearance of toxic soil has the potential to poison whole areas of people .\nCrops were heavily sprayed with pesticides that were designed to attack the nervous systems of insects \u2014 unfortunately they had the same effect on humans .\nThey were inhaled and absorbed through the skin and oral cavity , causing nausea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and bone malformation \u2013 all of which are common symptoms of heavy metal poisoning and polio .\nHeavy metals were present in everyday products in the 18th , 19th , and early 20th centuries .\nArsenic was used in synthetic dyes and syphilis treatments ; mercury was used in teething powders , dental fillings , and medical preparations .\nLead , arsenic , and mercury are neurotoxic environmental poisons \u2013 all are fat-soluble and therefore can affect fatty areas of the body such as the brain and nerves .\nOrthopaedist Jacob von @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1840 and speculated that it was a contagious disease .\nIt was named \u2018 acute anterior poliomyelitis \u2019 by Wilhelm Heinrich Erb in 1875 , by which time outbreaks had started to occur .\nSEE ALSO : W.H.O .\nNow Admits That Gates-funded Vaccine is Causing Polio Outbreak in Africa Regional patterns of disease led physicians to believe that polio was a contagious virus , but it was an unproven assumption .\nScientists had no idea what a virus was in the nineteenth century \u2014 nobody had seen one because the electron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was not invented until 1931 .\nA study of 2,000 case histories carried out by Harvard Infantile Paralysis Commission concluded that tonsillectomies ( introduced in 1909 and carried out routinely as a preventative measure ) provoked respiratory paralysis due to bulbar polio .\nThis was known at the time as authorities prohibited removal of tonsils and adenoids during epidemics .\nBulbar polio was the type that required use of an iron lung and had the highest death rate .\nThe case fatality rate in the early 1900s was very high .\nEngland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1912 , and it was endemic from then on .\nThe New York epidemic of 1916 saw patients experimented on with spinal injections of disinfectant and adrenaline .\nRoughly half of those treated died and were recorded as polio deaths .\nA new pesticide , DDT \u2014 labeled \u2018 the killer of killers \u2019 \u2014 was introduced just as WW2 began .\nPeople were led to believe it was good for them and even sprayed it on their children \u2019 s lunches .\nIt is a cumulative poison and can be absorbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to ban DDT in the early 1950s , but the damage was done .\nThe UK outlawed it in 1986 , and it was banned worldwide in 2001 , though it continues to be used in areas with high malaria incidence .\nEpidemics peaked in the 1940s and 50s and physicians began to notice a correlation between certain medical interventions and polio paralysis .\nChildren treated for congenital syphilis with arsenic-based Salvarsan often developed paralysis in their injected limbs .\nCases of polio rose in line with the expansion of vaccination programmes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe diphtheria vaccine was introduced in the UK in 1942 and was noted for its adverse effects .\nThe British Medical Association published news on the 10th of April 1950 that the diphtheria vaccine was responsible for childhood paralysis attributed to polio .\nA doctor at Guy \u2019 s Hospital in London found that 80 children developed paralysis within a month of receiving the shots ; a health ministry doctor reported that another 65 children had developed paralysis within a fortnight ; the St. Pancras medical officer found 40 more cases .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ but others were still paralysed 18 months after onset .\nTwo of the cases followed injection of penicillin .\nAnne McLaren , writing for Cambridge University Press in 1957 , stated that , \u201c It is now well established that intramuscular inoculation with combined diphtheria-pertussis prophylactics can affect the course of poliomyelitic infection in children .\nLocalisation of paralysis in the limb injected with vaccines was reported by McCloskey , Martin , Geffen , Hill & Knowelden , and Benjamin in 1950.\n\u201d In 1951 , Dr Ralph Scobey and Dr Mortind Biskind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the paralysis around the country known as \u2018 polio \u2019 was being caused by industrial poisons , and that a virus theory was purposely fabricated by the chemical industry and the government to deflect litigation away from both parties .\nThe diagnostic criteria for polio were very loose prior to trials for the vaccine in 1954 .\nOnly after the vaccine was introduced was there any effort to distinguish polio from other types of paralytic disease .\nThe first polio vaccine , created by Jonas Salk in 1955 , caused a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Incident \u2019 happened when 120,000 children were injected with a live virus instead of a weakened one : 40,000 developed polio , 200 were paralysed , and ten died .\nWhen the immunisation program was eventually rolled out to the public , a different , untested , rapidly approved formula was used .\nSalk later admitted that live virus vaccines against influenza or poliomyelitis might produce the diseases they intended to prevent ( Science , 4th March 1977 ) .\nIn 1956 , the American Medical Association ordered that doctors could no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be called \u2018 acute flaccid paralysis \u2019 .\nThis reduced polio statistics dramatically and gave the appearance that the vaccine programme had succeeded , when really the definition of the disease had just changed .\nSimple , timely changes to diagnostic criteria meant the number of paralytic cases dropped irrespective of the vaccine programme .\nLaboratory testing for polio wasn \u2019 t introduced until 1958 .\nBefore then , all manner of other diseases could be classed as polio , including other enteroviruses , lead , arsenic , and DDT poisoning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syndrome , viral or aseptic meningitis , traumatic neuritis , and Reye \u2019 s syndrome .\nHow many were misdiagnosed and put on the wrong path of treatment as a result ?\nIt is claimed that the polio vaccine eradicated polio due to overblown , tightly controlled propaganda campaigns , but the truth is that cases plummeted because of changes in pesticide use , elimination of toxic metals in everyday products , improved diets and sanitary behaviour , and redefinition of the disease .\nThere is no convincing evidence of polio as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all but obsolete in the modern world and the only \u2018 polio \u2019 we see nowadays is vaccine-induced , courtesy of immunisation programmes run by the World Health Organisation .\nThere has been a huge rise in vaccine-induced polio paralysis in India .\nIn 2011 there were an extra 47,000 cases , which were directly proportionate to the amount of oral vaccines administered .\nIn 2018 a vaccine tainted with eradicated type-2 polio was given to children in Uttar Pradesh .\nThe country remains vulnerable to polio due to its continued use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and diets high in sugar and low in vitamins .\nResearch scientist Viera Scheibner says that modern day vaccine advocates have forgotten the \u2018 polio provocation \u2019 of the past .\nShe believes that vaccines represent a assault on the immune system , which seems to be clearly implicated in the shadowy history of polio .\nVaccines were not needed to combat polio .\nDr Fred Klenner published results of a study that used intravenous vitamin C to cure polio and other viral diseases 73 years ago \u2014 six years before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of 100 % , we have to ask why this simple , non-toxic , affordable cure was completely overlooked and ignored by the medical community .\nWhy is it still ignored ?\nThe answer may lie in the criminal deceptions peddled by medical-industrial-pharmaceutical cartels that

Biosecurity Initiative for Zoonoses Risk Management Activities in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealing with proliferation-critical animal disease pathogens in Ukraine ; This project is a continuation of a cooperation between the Friedrich Loeffler Institute for Animal Health ( FLI ) and two Ukrainian institutes , the State Scientific Research Institute of Laboratory Diagnostics and Veterinary and Sanitary Expertise SSRILDVSE and Ukraine State Scientific Control Institute of Biotechnology and Strains of Microorganisms ( SSCIBSM / DNKIBSHM ) in Kiev , which are responsible in the field of veterinary diagnostics and handling of highly pathogenic biosecurity-relevant pathogens .\nThe project is funded by the German Foreign Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in its third funding phase since the beginning of 2020 .\nThe project aims to strengthen the capacity in partner countries to diagnose bacterial infections such as anthrax , brucellosis , and glanders , and viral infections such as African Swine Fever ( ASF ) , and Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever ( CCHF ) in animals .\nThese overall objectives are addressed in three work packages , which are also represented by the three different institutes of the FLI ( INNT/INEID , IVD and IBIZ ) , together with the two partner institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ INNT / INEID : Institute of Novel and Emerging Infectious Diseases /Institute for Novel and Emerging Animal Pathogens These Projects are classified by themes : : Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus ( CCHFV ) ( FLI-INNT ) .\nMolecular and serological methods are used to test the samples .\nThe role of FLI and INNT in the German Biosecurity Program in Ukraine When looking further into the WP3 Project , we realised that the Friedrich Loeffler Institute for Animal Health ( FLI ) is the partner of the Institute for Microbiology of the German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across several related projects .\nThis poses the same dilemma with the US Department of Defense DTRA financing and partnering in highly sensitive BioForensic projects in Ukraine , which of course includes the retrieval , handling and study of highly dangerous pathogens .\nThe lack of transparency and international independent oversight in such partnership is questionable to say the least , and of course raises some very fundamental yet concerning questions about the intention and scope of these projects .\nAccording to investigative journalist Dilyana Gaytandzhieva \u2019 s article , German and Ukrainian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pathogens in birds ( 2019-2020 ) .\nThe project was carried out by the Institute for Experimental and Clinical Veterinary Medicine ( Kharkov ) and The Friedrich Loeffler Institute , Federal Research Institute for Animal Health ( FLI ) from Germany .\nAccording to the project description , the main objective of this project was to sequence the genomes of orthomyxoviruses ( causes bird flu ) and to discover new viruses in birds .\nFor Washington \u2019 s part , the use of migratory birds to potentially transmit pathogens has been an important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institute and the US Department of Defense in the past .\nGaytandzhieva added that the Russian Defense Ministry also demonstrated that in 2020 the DTRA funded a similar project in Ukraine known as UP-4 .\nThe aim of that project was to explore the potential of particularly dangerous pathogens that can be transmitted by migratory birds , including the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza , whose lethality in humans can reach 50 % , and the Newcastle Disease Virus ( NDV ) , a highly infectious disease affecting poultry and other birds .\nAt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further and investigate the potential synergies between the Ukraine State Scientific Control Institute of Biotechnology and Strains of Microorganisms ( SSCIBSM / DNKIBSHM ) and the work undertaken by the US Department of Defense \u2019 s DTRA , and their associated contractors Black & Veatch Special Projects Corp and Metabiota Inc in Ukraine .\nHere we can also identify Germany \u2019 s local partners in Ukraine and see if they too were working with the US Department of Defense and their contractors .\nWell , to be honest it didn \u2019 t take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employees of the Ukraine Institute ( SSCIBSM / DNKIBSHM ) who are in a cooperation agreement with the German Friedrich Loeffler Institute for Animal Health ( FLI ) , and are also participating in workshops and meetings organised by none other than Black & Veatch and Metabiota Inc .\nHere are at least 4 confirmed series of meetings : From March 25 to 27 ( Session I ) and from April 2 to 4 ( Session II ) 2019 employees of DNKIBSHM ( Klestova ZS , Kudryavchenko OP ) , at the invitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Metabiota , in the framework of the Biological Threat Reduction Program in Ukraine ( PBS ) , took part in meetings on the launch of the Joint Biological Research Project ( JDS ) of the UP-10 project ( Kyiv , Ukraine ) .\nOn June 20 , 2019 , Deputy Director for Research of DNKIBSHM ( Klestova ZS ) , at the invitation of Black and Veatch Special Projects Corp. / \u201c Metabiota Inc. \u201d as part of the cooperation between the Government of Ukraine and the United States of America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Joint Working Group ( Kyiv , Ukraine \u2013 \u201c Klitschko Expo \u201d ) .\nFrom October 21 to 22 , 2019 , an employee of DNKIBSHM ( Voronina AK ) , at the invitation of Black and Veatch Special Projects Corp. / Metabiota Inc. , participated in the Seminar within the concept of \u201c Unified Health \u201d \u201c : \u201d Writing Grant Applications \u201c within the Biological Threat Reduction Program in Ukraine with the support of the US Department of Defense Threat Reduction Agency ( Kyiv , Ukraine ) .\n40 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the staff of DNKIBSHM ( Napnenko OO , Kudryavchenko OP ) , at the invitation of the companies \u201c Black and Veatch Special Projects Corp. \u201d / \u201c Metabiota Inc. \u201d , in the framework of the Biological Reduction Program Threats in Ukraine ( PFSA ) participated in the Workshop on the Results and Implementation of the CAP Model of the Joint Biological Research ( JAP ) UP-10 Project : \u201c

and strategies to control the ASF virus \u201d ( Kyiv , Ukraine ) .\nAnd here is the confirmation ( from the same page ) where the Deputy Director of Research of the Ukraine State Scientific Control Institute of Biotechnology and Strains of Microorganisms ( SSCIBSM / DNKIBSHM ) is invited by the German Friedrich Loeffler Institute for Animal Health ( FLI ) to attend an international Zoonoses Symposium in Berlin , Germany .\nOr here with the Ukraine State Scientific Control Institute of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ / DNKIBSHM ) participating in training on diagnosis of Anthrax and Brucellosis part of the German Biosafety Program to Ukraine with GIZ and FLI .\nThe evidence of them working together on Molecular Typing of Ukrainian Bacillus Anthracis Strains are available here .\nThe project is financed by the German Federal Foreign Office within the framework of phase III of the German Biosafety Program ( Ref .\nAA-OR12-370.43 BIOS FLI UKR ) .\nAgain , I want to be very clear that no accusations are being made here \u2013 we are merely pointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Defense Department and the DTRA which have financed both U.S. biotech firms Black & Veatch and Metabiota \u2019 s work in Ukraine \u2013 just happened to be working with Ukraine \u2019 s State Scientific Control Institute of Biotechnology and Strains of Microorganisms ( SSCIBSM / DNKIBSHM ) the very partner of the Friedrich Loeffler Institute for Animal Health ( FLI ) who itself is a partner of the Institute for Microbiology of The German Armed Forces .\nBeyond this , readers are welcome to draw their own conclusions .\nFurther below , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the German Armed Forces is also developing cooperation with The Kharkiv National Medical University ( KhNMU ) in Ukraine .\nIncidentally The Institute of Novel and Emerging Infectious Diseases ( INEID ) part of the Friedrich Loeffler Institute for Animal Health ( FLI ) is also focused on viral zoonoses caused by Coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 amongst others .\nAgain , we are merely pointing out these clear relationships , and not necessarily accusing these German organizations of being involved in any nefarious activities .\nThe German Biosafety Program is carried out under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foreign Affairs .\nAs for GIZ the German Society for International Cooperation , they have been operating in Ukraine since 1993 .\nGIZ supports the Ukrainian government in the process of public administration reform and contributes to the German Biosecurity Program .\nGoing back to the IMB also known as the Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology ( Institute of Microbiology of the German Armed Forces ) , we must reiterate that it is a military research facility of the German Armed Forces for Medical Biological Defence .\nThey develop methods and measures to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warfare agents and other dangerous pathogens .\nMost military around the world have accepted vaccinations as the best way of protecting their troops , and therefore it is not too much of a stretch to say that to develop such vaccines one need to study and manipulate viruses and dangerous pathogens .\nThere is no doubt that Germany , the US and other European countries , have all developed strong ties with the Ukrainian scientific biodefense R & D community , as the country provide an ideal bioforensic site for biosafety , biosecurity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous and high threat pathogens .\nThe problem remains that such activities undertaken in a country as violent as Ukraine can only be described as a high risk operation that could unnecessarily endanger the European populations , and the world at large .\nFebruary 2020 , Ukrainian officials kicked-off the start of their third funding phase with a visit to Kharkiv .\nThe Kharkiv National Medical University ( KhNMU ) , as well as the Institute of Microbiology of the German Armed Forces , sealed their future cooperation by signing a declaration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details of their relationship but the KhNMY is not advertising this cooperation on their website .\nWhy would that be , if it is genuine ?\nIn partnership with the German Armed Forces ( Bundeswehr ) and Kharkiv National Medical University ( KhNMU ) , they were the co-organizers of the 2nd Ukrainian scientific-practical conference on \u201c Relevant problems of medicine in the security and defense sector , \u201d and the topic of hybrid warfare was on the agenda as well .\nThe Head of the project , the director of the Bundeswehr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said that German representatives hope for long-term cooperation with KhNMU , and ready to provide diagnostic test systems , to train specialists and to further promote scientific cooperation and improve the diagnosis of Hantavirus infection in Kharkiv region .\n\u201c We hope that this partnership will serve to broaden the range of our cooperation and , in addition , to strengthen the link between veterinary and human health medicine.\n\u201d ( Image : December 28 , 2021 , the original picture

, the German Society for International Cooperation ( GIZ ) , Ukraine National scientific center Institute of Experimental , Clinical Veterinary Medicine and KhNMU .\nThe IMB , The Institute for Microbiology of the Germany Armed forces , provides the expertise and scientific capabilities on a global scale , which makes them directly available for deployed Bundeswehr military personnel .\nThe aim is to rapidly detect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal diseases caused by potential biological agents , to identify treatment options , and to recommend adequate protective measures .\nThe Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology is a departmental research facility that specialises in biological medical defence .\nIts mission is to develop procedures and measures to protect military ( Bundeswehr ) personnel from disease caused by biological agents and to restore their health in the event of illness .\nTherefore , the scientific focus of the Institute is on a variety of pathogens and biological toxins that could potentially be used as biological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institute is translational in nature .\nTheir aim is to develop specific products that are made available to users or to provide science-based services by the Institute itself .\nThe focus is on products related to medical biological reconnaissance , i.e .\ndiagnostic methods to be used in the field as well as novel methods for attribution investigation in the field of microbial forensics .\nMoreover , these also include projects concerning prophylaxis and therapy as well as surveillance and risk assessment are carried out .\nThe Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national consultant laboratories , namely for tick-borne encephalitis ( TBE ) , Brucella and Yersinia pestis .\nTheir range of services is also available to all civilian healthcare facilities .\nCentral Diagnostic Unit of the IMB is involved in the EMERGE ( \u201c Efficient response to highly dangerous and emerging pathogens at EU and international level \u201d ) research project that is funded by the European Union .\nEMERGE is a European network of 40 laboratories that are specialised in the diagnostics of Risk Group 3 bacteria , and Risk Group 3 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objective is the evaluation of routine procedures and new diagnostic material for highly pathogenic microorganisms .\nProficiency testing schemes for external quality control , training programs and the exchange of experience during network meetings serve to enhance the ability to react appropriately to threat situations and disease outbreaks at the EU level and beyond .\nFurther information on the EMERGE program : www.emerge.rki.eu and at the organisation \u2019 s website .\nScientists at the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine worked intensively with the Public Health Institute of Ukraine ( PHCU ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as with regional laboratories in Kharkiv , Lviv , and Odessa A Memorandum of Understanding ( MOU ) between the Centre for Public Health of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine and the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine Virology and Laboratory BSL was signed July 18 , 2018 .\nBoth parties agreed to cooperate within the framework of a joint research project : improving the level of biosafety by improving diagnosis and research into the prevalence of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever ( CCHF ) , and Hantaviruses in Ukraine in 2018-2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal Foreign Office ( Project No .\n68727 EN 02761868 ) .\nAs part of this project , one thousand blood serum samples from citizens from different regions of Ukraine who belong exclusively to the Slavic ethnic group were sent to the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg .\nThe Russians have alleged that one of the goals of the US and its NATO allies is to develop dangerous bio agents that selectively target different ethnic groups amongst which the Slavic ethnic group .\nIn the following translated PDF document ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early pages of the MOU between the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine between ( BNITM ) and the Public Health Center of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine ( PHC ) .\nThe PDF also provide evidence of the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut ( FLI ) working on join research program P444 , P44A , P44B \u2013 through the Science & Technology Center of Ukraine ( STCU ) in association with the USDA the United States Department of Agriculture .\nThe similarity to the research conducted by the DTRA UP8 and UP4 programs are obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but all in all , it seems very plausible ) .\nIt is also important to note that Ukraine \u2019 s STCU is international in scope , with its main headquarters in Kiev , and regional offices in Kharkov and Lvov , as well as operations in Baku , Chisinau and Tbilisi .\nHowever , according to data recently released on April 14th by the Russian Ministry of Defence \u2019 s Chemical and Biological Threat Expertise Centre , the STCU \u2019 s main activity appears to be as \u201c a distribution centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pentagon , including biological weapons research.\n\u201d In recent years , Washington is believed to have spent more than $ 350 million on STCU projects .\nAdditionally , it is believed that the U.S. customers and sponsors of STCU are the Department of State and the Department of Defense , with funding also provided through the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , the US Departments of Agriculture , Health and Energy .\nWithin the same April 2022 Russian MoD data release , it is also stated how during Russia \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was established that US scientists from a laboratory in Merefa ( Kharkov Region ) were testing potentially dangerous biological drugs on patients of the regional clinical psychiatric hospital No 3 in Kharkov between 2019 and 2021 .\nCertainly , the disturbing specter of western-funded Ukrainian institutions ( especially they are funded and directed by the United States and EU member state Germany ) engaged in the experimentation of disabled or mentally ill persons \u2013 should evoke similar horrors wrought upon Europe during the reign of Nazi Germany in the early 20th century .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ been extinguished from the civilised world decades ago .\nTo even consider that these and other questionable \u2018 life sciences \u2019 endeavors , including the development of dangerous bioweapons materials or race-specific pathogens , are being offshored by western governments to an openly corrupted regulatory environment like Ukraine \u2013 should be grounds for further investigation by the appropriate domestic and international agencies .\nA series of scientific publications in the early 2000s ushered in an era of heightened concern about the potential for misapplication of scientific technological advancements to achieve malevolent outcomes .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which the nuclear physics community has been dealing with for more than 70 years .\nHowever , in the realm of life sciences , advancements in biotechnology represent a \u201c dual-use \u201d dilemma in which the same technologies can be used legitimately for human benefit to cure or stave off epidemics , or misused for bioterrorism or for bio-weaponery purposes .\nThere has been an expansion of research involving pathogens of consequence , not only in the U.S. but globally , as well as an increase in foreign laboratory funding and associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , international standards on how these facilities are built and designed and operated , are often hidden under a veil of secrecy .\nThe lack of transparency in sensitive research funded by western governments including their Department of Defense , Health and Agriculture , just to name a few , offers ample opportunities and means for dangerous Gain of Function ( GOF ) research to be conducted under the cover of international Biosafety Research Program , or other similar projects .\nThe work of EcoHealth Alliance ( EHA ) and Metabiota at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a striking example of potentially questionable partnerships .\nIt is quite clear now that both companies enjoy a close relationship with the US DOD or/and the CIA , which could explain why they are still in business today .\nAny other companies would have not survived such public outrage nor the bad publicity arising from their proximity with characters such as Hunter Biden , Ghislaine Maxwell , and Peter Daszak , the President of the much-maligned EcoHealth Alliance .\nGOF studies involving pathogens with pandemic potential is a term used to refer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that confers new or enhanced activity .\nThe impact of proliferation of biosecurity programs is obvious .\nWhat are the actual guarantees given to the public to ensure that those with malevolent intentions can not easily gain access to extremely dangerous pathogens , or what happens if unscrupulous agents were to work within these biosecurity programs ?\nGOF , as well as LOF ( loss-of-function ) studies are commonplace in the life sciences , and have been essential elements of modern molecular biology .\nAccording to its proponents , the potential benefits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of host-pathogen interactions , the pandemic potential of emerging pathogens , public health and preparedness efforts , and development of medical countermeasures .\nHowever , the potential risks of GOF studies include the generation of novel engineered pathogens that could pose a pandemic threat , either accidentally , or if released intentionally , as well as the creation of information that could be misused to threaten public safety or national security .\nThe additional risk of proliferation of these questionable practices , discussed above , exacerbates these risks as the number of biolabs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those studies employing GOF-type approaches .\nThe increasing number of these types of labs also increases the risks of accidental , or deliberate weaponised release of an experimental pathogen .\nI will finish this analysis by directing you to an article published by TASS ( Russian News Agency ) on the 31 March , 2022 , entitled , \u201c

( Source : Twitter ) In an effort to stave off further Russian advances , a close ally of President Biden , Democrat US Senator Chris Coons , has proposed a new plan to place US troops inside of Ukraine .\nDuring a recent interview with CBS News , he said , \u201c The American people can not turn away from this tragedy in Ukraine.\n\u201d After the dramatic defeat of NATO \u2019 s proxy forces in Mariupol , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 losing \u2019 the war in Ukraine .\n\u201c I think the history of the 21st century turns on how fiercely we defend freedom in Ukraine and that Putin will only

Coons is warning that a failure for America to act now will somehow make Ukraine \u2018 become the Syria of Eastern Europe.\n\u2019 \\ \u201c If Vladimir Putin , who has shown us how brutal he can be , is allowed to just continue to massacre civilians , to commit war crimes throughout Ukraine without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forcefully to his aid , I deeply worry that what \u2019 s going to happen next is that we will see Ukraine turn into Syria , \u201d added Coons .\nThe irony of that statement is that by placing US troops inside of Ukraine it would make the situation similar to Syria , but not in the way Sen. Coons is suggesting .\nIndeed , that irony is well understood by anyone who has watched the illegal US occupation in northeastern Syria .\nSince 2017 , the US has embedded between 500 and @ @ @ @ @ @

Syria , any official US military presence inside of Ukraine ( unofficially , there are at least hundreds of American military and intelligence personnel already active inside the country working in various capacities ) would be used by Washington and NATO as a type of a casus belli \u2013 not necessarily to provoke a war with Russia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking any US controlled areas and thus avoid a direct military confrontation between Russia and US-NATO .\nWhether this would serve as a successful deterrent against striking resident US targets as it has in Syria \u2013 is debatable , to say

Ukraine .\nMoreover , Russia also sent an official diplomatic note to the United States this past week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplies of arms and military equipment to Ukraine .\nSenator Coon \u2019 s remarks come just days after a speech delivered to the University of Michigan , where he stated that the US must become directly involved militarily , because failure to intervene now would mean , \u201c we are inviting another level of escalation in brutality by Putin.\n\u201d It \u2019 s a familiar Washington script .\nJust substitute \u201c Putin \u2019 s brutality \u201d ( like the recent likely

murders of men women and children in the Odessa massacre on May 2 , 2014 by fascists \u2013 was the catalyst that drove the people of Crimea and the Donbass region to refuse to live under an American EU-NATO installed , rogue regime in Ukraine .\nFollowing the western-backed Maidan coup d \u2019 etat in 2014 , Crimeans voted to join the Russian Federation .\nSimilarly , the people of Lugansk and

a repressive military occupation by their fellow countrymen .\nPeaceful protests were brutally repressed by the Ukranian Armed Forces , many of whom openly declared their fascist affiliations and

in Kiev .\nHaving visited both Lugansk and Donetsk , I am reliably informed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict and could have freed most of eastern Ukraine .\nMuch like today , large sections of the Ukraine forces were surrounded .\nIn 2014 , they were allowed to evacuate unhindered .\nI say this because having spared the lives of the mainly conscripted Ukraine soldiers , some of whom wanted no part in the Kiev coup \u2019 s vicious attack on their fellow citizens , the people of the liberated independent Republics of Lugansk and Donetsk have suffered 8 years of continuous attacks along the line of contact , the de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thousands were murdered and many more injured .\nIn 2022 , the Ukraine Army is once again committing heinous war crimes against Russian speaking , Russian Orthodox , Catholic Ukrainians , and in some cases killing , torturing , maiming , raping and castrating those they deem to be \u201c sub human.\n\u201d The Untermench , was a German word used by the Nazis to describe inferior people such as Jews , Roma and Slavs to include Poles , Serbs , Ukrainians and Russians .\nFrom Russian-speaking Ukrainians to gypsies , Roma , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , NATO , American , British or EU narrative , many have suffered appallingly under these fascist monsters , who are roaming Ukraine with western media support seeking out what they perceive as the enemies of the Ukrainian state .\nIf the people \u2019 s militia had continued their advance in 2014 , then Ukraine might not be where it is today .\nIf Russia had recognised the Donbass republics in 2014 , the current war may never have become necessary .\nAllowing the failed Minsk Agreements of 2014 and 2015 to form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hindsight , may have only encouraged America , the EU and NATO to rearm the fascists brigades run by Kiev and encourage the reoccupation of the Donbass .\nIn 2022 , it all finally came to a head , thus forcing Russia to intercede to defend Russian-speaking ethnic Ukrainians and Russian passport-holding citizens against a possible massacre .\nWith Bucha we have an example of why Russia should not abandon areas it liberates .\nThe Russians having freed Bucha , who were welcomed by sections of the population , and then withdrew from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOn March 31st , the Ukrainian Mayor of Bucha announced that his town was liberated from Russian troops , and it was

video shoot .\nReaders can draw their own conclusions as to what transpired there , and no doubt countless others will forensically dissect the video evidence offered by the Kiev and supported by Western MSM and governments , in what continues to resemble false flag propaganda and a craven attempt to reinvent facts on the ground .\nIf Russia allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again go free to merge with mercenaries and jihadists , we may simply have a new extended line of contact which NATO and the Biden Administration will continue to exploit .\nPutin and the Russian government may ( or may not ) believe guarantees given by Zelensky and the Ukrainian Parliament \u2013 that Ukraine will remain a non-NATO , neutral country , and recognise the Lugansk Peoples Republic ( LPR ) and Donetsk Peoples Republic ( DPR ) , with Crimea as part of the Russian Federation .\nHowever , any assurances given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were guaranteed and underpinned by France and Germany , and signed by the Kiev regime \u2013 may simply be ignored if it is politically convenient to do so .\nA buffer zone is now in play , followed by a new de facto border between Ukraine , and the LPR and DPR .\nEventually , Russia will have effectively expanded into Ukraine .\nAmerica , for its own domestic and foreign capitalist interests , wants an extended and prolonged exhausting and financially debilitating war for Russia in Ukraine which , in conjunction with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Russian economy over the long term and destabilise the government in Moscow .\nRussia has the largest land mass in Europe , but an overall economy comparable to Spain or Italy , and America believes it can destroy Russia and install its own pro-western Imperialist puppet regime , much like it had under Boris Yeltsin , so that western financiers and corporations can steal the wealth and natural resources \u2013 which belong to the Russian people .\nConsider this a prelude to a similar attack on China , for the same material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on May 2 , 2014 .\nRemember the sacrifice of 27 million Russians who died during WWII , many in the fight to defeat fascism in Europe .\nRemember the victims of fascism ; the Jews , the Poles ,

the forces at work on the ground in Ukraine .\nI am not tactically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and distractive assaults .\nI do know it \u2019 s wrong to liberate people and then abandon them to forces who have no regard for human life and glorify in the death of the other .\nAll care should be taken to avoid such outcomes .\nI am not a religious person .\nIf I was , I would pray for all those who are not Ukrainian nationalists now living in fear , under threat and in constant dread of coming to the attention of the Ukrainian fascist troops , their intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is time we all stood against fascism .\nZelensky has been quoted as saying the new Ukraine will resemble Israel much more than it will resemble any European country .\nDoes he mean , armed soldiers will be on every street corner ?\nDoes he mean an openly apartheid state ?\nDoes he mean that Russian-speaking indigenous Ukrainians will be subject to arrest interrogation , and treated as enemies of the state ?\nWill prisons be filled with those who oppose the new regime ?\nThen yes , I guess he is right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than it will any current European society .\nIn that respect , both Israel and the new Ukraine will resemble Nazis Germany of the 1930 \u2019 s much more than anyone will care to admit .\n*** Fra Hughes is an author , activist , and political commentator based in Belfast , Northern

\u2013 at an astounding $ 54.20 per share in cash .\nIt \u2019 s a deal that so many in \u2018 liberal \u2019 Silicon Valley feared , and the predictable backlash against free speech has already begun

Bernie Sanders , wrote : \u2018 Twitter employees , may we introduce you to @ CODE_CWA , \u2019 referring to an initiative of the Communication Workers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Times , General Electric and Verizon among its major employers .\nInside Twitter , employees are reportedly dismayed at the realization that Musk is now their boss .\n\u2018 I feel like im going to throw up..I rly

prospect of losing control over this massive social engineering and digital censorship empire , other more moderate and sober voices are slowly emerging within liberal punditry , including this passage by Derek Thompson at The Atlantic , who gingerly admits , \u201c Let \u2019 s be honest : Musk buying Twitter could be good for Twitter.\n\u201d He writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little social punishment for being relentlessly negative about everything .\n( When you \u2019 re paid to follow a news cycle that ping-pongs among authoritarianism , pandemic , and war , \u201c relentless

.\nCan the mercurial CEO hold the fort together under such immense internal political and external media pressure ?\nIndeed , Musk has vowed to restore free speech on Twitter , and he has also planned to \u2018 enhance the product with new features \u2019 and to \u2018 make the algorithms open source to increase trust \u2019 .\nThis all sounds well enough , but the DNC , the US government , and Five Eyes intelligence agencies already have their collective hooks sunk deeply into this company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bumpy road .\nTime will tell whether he makes good on these promises , or whether

"title": "Like PCR, Rapid Antigen Tests Are Making \u2018Viruses\u2019 Real Again", "content": "In the so-called New Normal epoch , the key to keeping a pandemic program going has always been through nondiagnostic mass-testing .\nSince February 2022 , we have been told by the government that there has been an explosion of COVID-19 cases in New Zealand , as has occurred in most other countries following the purported discovery of the \u201c highly infectious Omicron variant \u201d in South Africa .\nHowever , as I have previously explained , Omicron is as fictional as the original SARS-CoV-2 \u201c virus \u201d , which was invented , not discovered , in Wuhan by taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknown provenance and instructing a machine de novo to organise a selection of these \u201c short reads \u201d into a new genome using two other invented genomes as the reference templates .\nThese days , such \u201c viral genomes \u201d , which exist only in computers and cloud-based gene banks , are taken as proof by many intelligent people that pathogenic viruses exist in actuality and that the science is therefore settled .\nAfter all , laboratories around the world continue to process samples that reference the invented genome called \u201c SARS-CoV-2 \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as GISAID by the millions .\nIn fact , at the time of writing there are 9,605,822 \u201c SARS-CoV-2 genomes \u201d on the leaderboard as it climbs to the moon .\nHowever , not one of these in silico-assembled genomic sequences has ever been shown to exist in nature , let alone come from inside a disease-causing particle .\nOver the past two years , many people , both sceptics of , and believers in the COVID-19 narrative , have come to the conclusion that the Polymerase Chain Reaction ( PCR ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c infections , \u201d including , most recently , Dr Anthony Fauci .\nFor those aware of the deeper issues , it should be apparent that the PCR is not just unreliable in this application , but it is completely invalid .\nAside from all the other issues related to the interpretation of crude nasopharyngeal sample test results , if the genetic sequences the PCR is calibrated to have not been shown to belong to a pathogenic microbe , what is it supposed to be testing for ?\nNever mind that as has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a meaningless clinical entity , with no specific symptoms , signs , or confirmatory investigations , and thus all COVID-19 PCR test results are worthless .\nWatch the following video presentation by Dr Sam Bailey which asks the fundamental question : what actually constitutes a COVID-19 \u2018 case \u2019 ?\nUnfortunately , despite the above , even COVID sceptics appear to have been seduced by Rapid Antigen Testing ( RAT ) , also known as lateral flow testing .\nIn fact , some have suggested that a bout of illness that corresponds to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests , can be presented as evidence that the \u201c virus \u201d exists \u2013 Sam recently responded to one such claim .\nWe also dealt with the issue of these pointless tests in early 2021 , when they were rolled out in many countries around the world .\nEssentially , it is one indirect test piggybacked on another indirect test ( the PCR ) , with the latter having no established diagnostic validity .\nThis doesn \u2019 t stop RAT researchers from calling the PCR , the \u2018 gold standard \u2019 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit longer .\nPut otherwise , because this phantom pandemic was built not on the basis of a clinical diagnosis of an illness but on the fraudulent misapplication of the PCR , a newer , cheaper and easy-to-use-at-home test for purportedly detecting the imaginary SARS-CoV-2 was introduced so as to perpetuate the fear of this phantom illness and to extend the life of its prescribed narrative .\nHere in New Zealand , RAT is a relatively new phenomenon and it is currently all the rage for those participating in the COVID-19 circus .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ that \u201c along with the 5.1 million tests already in the country , New Zealanders will have access to over 55 million rapid antigen tests in the coming two months.\n\u201d Two weeks later , \u201c cases \u201d of the meaningless entity COVID-19 went parabolic .\nIn early March , RAT was said to be detecting 97 percent of these cases .\nBy that stage , Rapid Antigen Tests were being provided for \u201c free \u201d for all and sundry , with many feeling the need to test themselves or their children several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder what happened here ?\nUnlike the PCR , which amplifies selected genetic fragments , RAT purports to detect a protein , currently the \u201c SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid \u201d or \u2019 N \u2019 -protein .\nThere are no published papers proving the existence and biochemical properties of a pathogen termed SARS-CoV-2 , so the protein can not be claimed to have any specificity to a \u201c virus \u201d \u2013 it is simply a protein class found in some humans and mammalian tissue culture experiments .\nThe typical test kit contains a membrane onto which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed .\nThe fluid is drawn along the membrane and mixes with a fixed \u201c anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody \u201d ( read : something that will react with the non-specific N-protein ) conjugated with gold .\nIf this reaction occurs a visible bar is produced on the strip .\nBut what does this actually mean ?\nIn October 2021 , I contacted one of the government \u2019 s approved RAT suppliers and put several questions to them , including the following : In December 2021 , they sent an email back to me with colourful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health and an offer to buy a box of 25 test kits for NZ $ 260 + GST , but with no answers to my questions .\nWhen we sought information about the accuracy of Rapid Antigen Testing , we consulted a section titled , \u201c RAT results and their accuracy \u201d , on the New Zealand Ministry of Health ( MOH ) website , which claims that the tests \u201c are quick and relatively simple to do but are not as accurate at telling whether you have COVID-19 as the PCR test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other words : they are completely useless .\nWe found that below this section is another section titled \u201c PCR test results accuracy \u201d which continues to conflate the analytical specificity of the PCR to detect pre-selected genetic fragments , with its diagnostic specificity for a condition ( \u201c COVID-19 \u201d ) .\nWe pointed out this fundamental error to the MOH ( and even lodged a complaint ) a long time ago , but they continue to refer to a website that contains only analytical performance data of the tests in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturer \u2019 s product information , you will see incredible performance claims , such as this one reporting their kit as having a specificity of 99.8 % .\nBut specificity for what exactly ?\nThe methodology reveals that they have compared their RAT kit results to PCR results \u201c using an FDA EUA RT-PCR reference method.\n\u201d As has been pointed out already , this has nothing to do with diagnosing a clinical condition : it is simply comparing one in vitro molecular reaction with another in the laboratory .\nThey didn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protocol they compared their test against was positive in 50 out of 483 asymptomatic subjects .\nBut these subjects with no illness whatsoever have COVID-19 according to the WHO , as a \u201c confirmed case \u201d simply requires a positive PCR result !\n( And just as ridiculously for a confirmed case : \u201c an asymptomatic person with a positive SARS-CoV-2 Antigen-RDT who is a contact of a probable or confirmed case.\n\u201d ) In this new world of \u201c pandemics \u201d , diseases no longer require people to be unwell , apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RAT is as pointless as using the PCR for diagnostics : they are both equally meaningless .\nUnfortunately , RAT has become one of New Zealand \u2019 s most common pursuits in recent weeks and hundreds of thousands of people now think they have the \u201c virus \u201d .\nThere are certainly a lot of sick people I \u2019 m seeing , but in my assessment it has nothing to do with a novel pathogen .\nTwo years of draconian restrictions , face masks , government-concocted fear narratives , and being gulled into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the island nation .\nMany are deconditioned , demoralised , and socially isolated .\nIn the latest chapter of COVID mass formation , the RAT frenzy has convinced many that , whatever symptoms they have ( or don \u2019 t have ) , the test kit informs them it is all due to a \u201c virus \u201d , even though the chemical reaction they are witnessing on their little test strip does not require the existence of one .\nIt certainly keeps the COVID narrative alive but hopefully more will wake up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realise that it has all been part of The Viral Delusion .\n*** Author Dr Mark Bailey is a microbiology , medical industry and health researcher who

NATO Shipping Depleted Uranium Weaponry Into Ukraine?", "content": "A shocking development which contravenes European and international commitments to a clean environment and protecting the health and well-being of their populations .\nDuring a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky this past week , President Emmanuel Macron insisted that France would step up its military and humanitarian support for Ukraine .\nThere is no question that Macron is committed in this respect .\nFollowing his re-election during the final round against challenger Marine Le Pen , he was adamant about his desire to work actively during his second term to restore Ukraine \u2019 s sovereignty and territorial integrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his European partners and allies .\nHe also indicated France \u2019 s readiness to contribute to an agreement that provides security guarantees for Ukraine .\nOf course , a key part of this support is the supply of weapons .\nSince the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine , France has always refused to specify exactly what type of armaments it was sending to Kiev .\nThe secret was finally revealed by Macron himself during an interview he gave on Thursday 21st April to news media outlet Ouest France .\nWhen asked if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy weapons , especially tanks , as German has done with its Leopard tanks , he replied : The interviewer went on asking if tanks were necessary , and this is Macron \u2019 s reply : Furthermore , Agence France-Presse ( AFP ) asked the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace for comments , but they did not specify the number of MILAN missiles and Caesar guns delivered , so as not to \u201c give operational information \u201d which could be used by the Russian Army .\nAn Elysian source specified that few dozens of MILAN anti-tank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already been given \u201d to the Ukrainian armed forces , confirming that few dozen weapons were taken from the stocks of the French armed forces , according to the Elys\u00e9e ( although these numbers seems very conservative ) .\nThe delivery of the Caesars guns was already in progress at the time , and is believed to have been shipped out with thousands of potentially lethal shells en route to Ukraine .\nSpurred on by a voracious defense industry lobby , western leaders have been pouring unprecedented amounts of money and arms into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Russian \u2019 s military intervention in Ukraine , some 13 billion euros worth of humanitarian , military , and financial support has been provided by G7 and European Union countries , according to data provided by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy and reported by Bloomberg .\nAccording to L \u2019 Opinion , French aid covers several different areas .\nOne of the most important contributions also relates to satellite imagery .\nFrance has several observation satellites ( Helios , Pl\u00e9iades and CSO ) which allow it to provide images several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff .\nIt is likely that this activity will place French in close collaboration with the allies , particularly with the United States military .\nReferring to French aid which is worth a total of 120 million euros ( if not more ) , French news media L \u2019 Opinion clarified that France also offered Javelin anti-tank missiles , and Mistral short-range anti-aircraft missiles .\nFrance delivered at least three types of light missiles The French government is yet to release the exact volume of these deliveries .\nThe supply of these weapon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ukrainian military personnel called upon to implement them .\nIt is not a state secret that Emmanuel Macron likes to pose as the guarantor of the Paris Agreement for the climate and sometimes as the Ambassador of the One Health Approach which was resumed in his 24th May 2021 speech which he gave at the 74th World Health Assembly in presence of Director-General of the World Health Organization , Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus .\nThis article will now focus on the actual weapons France and its allies are sending to Ukraine and examine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only for the environment , but also to people \u2019 s health .\nAccording to the various statement made by Macron \u2019 s government , we can gather that Milan missiles , Caesar guns and shells , are the bulk of these deliveries .\nIt is very clear that this material was chosen because it meets the following criteria : This second item is by far the most problematic .\nBefore analyzing these weapons it is important to understand the knowledge and perception associated with the use of Depleted Uranium ( DU ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief video presentation of the risks posed by DU munitions : According to the European Commission and their Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks ( SCHER ) , depleted uranium is a dense metal produced as a by-product of enrichment of natural uranium for nuclear fuel .\nIt is still radioactive , but at a lower level than the material at the beginning of the process .\nIt is used in armour-piercing ammunition , shells and bombs , in order to provide more penetrating power .\nSuch munitions were used in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iraq , and also in NATO \u2019 s war against Yugoslavia , specifically in battle theatres like Serbia and Kosovo .\nTheir repeated use has raised concerns about health threats from exposure to the distributed uranium material and particle dust .\nMany studies have reported evidence of its prevalence , as well as a lack thereof , depending on whose report you are reading .\nSuffice to say , reporting on this subject still remains very controversial .\nThe European commission is well aware of the hazards such weapons represent , here for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the European Commission , addressed to Florent Pirot , the Secretary of the European Association Against Depleted Uranium ( EAADU ) : For this reason , France \u2019 s weapons deliveries into the Ukraine war zone will have international implications .\nThe International Coalition to Ban Uranium Weapons ( ICBUW ) appears to be advocating for a ban on the use of uranium in all conventional weapons and weapon systems , and is engaged in monitoring , health care , compensation , and environmental remediation for communities affected by its use .\nHowever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definition of DU weapons and munitions .\nSadly the ICBUW seems to believe that only a limited number of depleted uranium weapons , namely 105 and 120 mm tank shells , and small caliber bullets ( 15/25/30 mm ) represent an actual danger to people and the environment , which naturally triggers the usual criticism towards the US government and others like it when such munitions are used , and therefore completely ignoring aircraft-dropped bombs ( GBUs ) , cruise missiles , and other types of anti-tank missiles .\nWhy would that be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sensitive one , even though governments have more or less acknowledged the use of uranium in these weapons .\nYet , the fact remain that they are used much more widely , because of uranium being the best penetrator against tanks and bunkers .\nDuring our research , we were amazed to find so many reports and cases where higher concentrations of uranium were found near bomb craters and other sites where missiles and bombs have landed .\nWe are meant to believe missiles or bombs land away from the populated areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such assumptions are simply not accurate .\nAn excellent article published 19 June 2016 by Florent Pirot the EAADU Secretary , provides a trove of information and data on this subject including a link to The Washington Spectator who published a damning report entitled \u201c Irradiated Iraq : The Nuclear Nightmare We Left Behind , \u201d which describes the health effects , including horrendous birth defects , resulting from the US military \u2019 s prolific use of weapons made with depleted uranium .\nAlthough Barbara Koeppel , who wrote this article faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( reminds me the scientific experts of the COVID 19 so-called pandemic ) , it is hard to ignore the alarm sounded in 2000 of Dr. Rosalie Bertell , a cancer research scientist and consultant to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission ( she died in 2012 ) , who stated that , \u201c DU is some thousand times more radioactive than the uranium found in soil and rock .\nNow let \u2019 s take a look at the weapons and ammunitions Macron is currently sending to Ukraine .\nThe MILAN is a product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program dating back to the 1960s .\nThe system entered service in 1972 as a second generation anti-tank guided missile , and soon became a standard anti-tank weapon throughout NATO , in use by most of the alliance \u2019 s individual armies .\nWith its rather short range ( 2000 meters ) is an old anti-tank guided missile ( ATGM ) , and is known for its depleted uranium contents .\nTo put things into perspective , it is important to be aware that between 1986 and 2003 , European armies such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were equipped with MILAN shoulder-fired anti-tank missiles , which emitted thorium-232 , a notoriously radioactive metal which emits particles that are six times more hazardous to human health than those released by already hazardous depleted uranium .\nBelow you can see in Ukraine , the Ukrainian Defense Forces are undergoing intensive training in mastering MILAN-2 anti-tank systems .\nIMAGE : The MILAN-2 ATGM in the service in Ukraine , footage from a CNN video ( April 2022 ) .\nThe MILAN system was designed as per the requirements of the German and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general requirements of NATO Command for such weapons .\nThus , the international association Euromissile has developed a system that , due to its high performance , has become the most widely used ( after the TOW ATGM ) of all anti-tank missiles , currently deployed in different countries .\nThe MILAN anti-tank system is used by military ground forces in 40 countries , including Germany , France , other NATO countries , and of course now Ukraine .\nWatch this brief presentation on the MILAN 2 anti-tank system : .\nThe use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern .\nI am saying this with the people of Serbia and Kosovo in mind , who discovered that the conflict which ended in 1999-2000 had left serious levels of radioactive contamination , just as it did in Kuwait some nine years before .\nWhy do the United States and NATO allies continue to use a waste product of the nuclear industry in their weapons ?\nSome commentators allege that it is a conspiracy between the military and the nuclear industry to dispose of dangerous waste in hostile countries .\nWhile this may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are certainly more complex .\nAs we speak , depleted uranium munitions are being fired on a regular basis at one of France \u2019 s military testing grounds , known as Canjuers .\nMany French soldiers have reported on the danger associated with the MILAN anti-tank guided missile .\nThe following is the kind of comment you will hear from soldier using it : \u201c Depleted uranium , we use it everyday in Canjuers \u201d \u2013 they said \u201c Do not come near the target , it is contaminated with depleted uranium , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the officer told them when training with Milan missiles in Canjuers ) .\nMore of these testimonies can be found here .\nThe Javelin , although known largely as an anti-tank missile packing a high-explosive anti-tank ( HEAT ) round that can penetrate the latest armor , is really a multi-role shoulder-launched missile system capable of taking out everything from heavy armor , to troops hiding behind cover , to low and slow flying aircraft .\nIts reusable command launch unit can also be used independently as a thermal imaging surveillance system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 ability to surveil their surroundings , especially at night .\nIt features wide-angle viewing modes as well as a zoom-in mode of up to 12X .\nUkraine has recently received American , but also French military support which includes thousands of Javelin anti-tank missiles .\nAll the data presented by the Ukrainian military confirms that these Javelins have depleted uranium warheads .\nThe missile and its launcher \u2013 the Command Launch Unit \u2013 together weigh 48.8 pounds , while the missile alone weighs 33 pounds , due to the extreme density and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florent Pirot \u2019 s article , the Javelin missiles \u2019 depleted uranium remain a terrible threat for the environment long after the battle is over \u2013 so much so , that it will make it impossible to live in an area whee these weapons were used , and not until a magnetic cleaning operation is enforced , and even then it still remains work that requires several passings in order to be left in a satisfactory state .\nPitot goes on to describe this as a crime to use these DU weapons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have achieved some tactical military superiority is somewhat naive , if not gullible , with respect to the low range and severe long-term risks posed by these weapons .\nGiven its incredibly dense nature , depleted uranium has been used for both tank armor and also in anti-tank ammunition .\nDepleted uranium is uranium with much of the U-235 removed .\nIt is basically what is left over after the process of enrichment .\nCoupled with a shaped charge , a depleted uranium round and the DU dart contained inside it , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the reason why Javelin anti-tank missiles have now become a symbol of Ukrainian resistance .\nOn April 5 , 2010 , the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified Congress on a possible Foreign Military Sale to France of 260 JAVELIN Anti-Tank Guided Missiles , 76 Command Launch Units with Integrated Day/Thermal Sights , and associated equipment , parts , and logistical support , for an estimated cost of $ 69 million .\nIt is fair to assume that France took possession of Javelin antitank missiles from the US , and sent some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe MISTRAL is manufactured by Matra ( now MBDA ) .\nIts first version was put into service in the French army in 1989 .\nIt is a very short-range surface-to-air weapon system intended to complete the surface-to-air coverage of the armored and mechanized corps .\nIt provides isolated units with their own air defense capability .\nIts targets are airplanes flying up to Mach 1.2 between 10m and 3000m and helicopters in motion or hovering .\nIts range is over 6km .\nWatch the following brief presentation on the MISTRAL mobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfair to not mention the British government , who out of the kindness of their heart have donated thousands of Next Generation Light Anti-Tank Weapon ( NLAW ) anti-tank guided missiles ( ATGM ) to Ukraine .\nThis missile system weighs 12.5 kg each , and has a range of no more than 1 kilometre .\nThese features indicate that these missiles ( made by Sweden prime defense contractor Saab Bofors ) include a substantial amount of depleted uranium .\nGiven its density , even relatively small quantities of DU would add significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its range , but with the added benefit of its armor penetrating ability .\nThese missiles explode above the tank to spray it with DU together with the surroundings .\nWe now know that there have likely been at least 8 shipments of these missiles sent .\n\u201c Thousands \u201d of NLAWs have been promised , meaning thousands of kilograms of depleted uranium has already entered Ukraine .\nAgain , these weapons are a known environmental and radioactive hazard , and when used in areas where civilians live , one can easily see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard their prolific use as a crime against humanity .\nWatch this brief presentation on the NLAW anti-tank system : You may have heard of Doug Rokke , the US Army veteran with a doctorate in radiation protection , who fell gravely ill from depleted uranium contamination .\nHis work was nothing short of exempliary , especially for his reports on the Iraq War , exposing areas destroyed by cruise missiles which were found to be radioactive .\nDoug made a video ( I warn you the video quality is rather poor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real take way ) for the US Army as part of a program he was commissioned to prepare to educate soldiers on the dangers of uranium ( a 40-hour training program that eventually ended up on the shelf .\nHe explains in his video that uranium was not only used in small calibre and tank shells , but also as a \u201c ballast \u201d in missiles .\nThe video was meant to become an official training video on the \u201c dangers of depleted uranium.\n\u201d Why is the use of DU controversial ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered controversial because of its potentially harmful effects on the environment and human health .\nIt was alleged that the enriched uranium exposure resulted in an increase in birth defects in Fallujah , Iraq .\nThe dust particles or fragments resulting from the use of DU ammunition could also contaminate the environment through air , soil , and the water .\nHowever , there is still a dearth of conclusive research or evidence which directly links the adverse effects on human and environment to the use of DU ammunition , most likely because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governments involved in their manufacture and use .\nHence , much more research and scientific studies need to be conducted and brought forward for the benefit of millions around the world .\nThe United States has already confirmed that DU ammunitions were used in Syria .\nThe use of such weapons has long been criticized for posing health risks to both combatants , and also to civilians , not to mention the environment , but to date , the US has shown very little interest in taking responsibility for any of the fall-out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We must also ask : what are the potential legal issues arising out of the use of DU in various international and non-international military operations and armed conflicts ?\nHere is an article about it , asking the right questions .\nWhat else is on its way to Ukraine ?\nFrance \u2019 s Defence Minister Florence Parly confirmed on Twitter that France would also send \u201c several Caesar artillery cannons and thousands of shells \u201d .\nBuilt by partly state-owned arms maker Nexter , the Caesar is a 155mm howitzer mounted on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shells at ranges of more than 40km ( 25 miles ) .\nUkrainian officials including President Zelenskyy have repeatedly implored European and NATO powers , especially artillery .\nThe Caesar artillery system is a self-propelled gun that is manufactured by Nexter Systems in Versailles .\nThe weapon is the product of a collaboration with Lohr Industrie of Hangenbieten , in France , and was first ordered by the French Army in 2003 .\nBy December 2004 , at least 72 more Caesars were ordered for the French Army , and used to replace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The weapons system officially entered into regular production in 2006. ou can find out more about the Caesar Gun and the destructive nature of the Ogre shells bomblets at : www.army-technology.com .\nHow about Germany \u2019 s generosity toward Ukraine ?\nLast week , Germany reversed a historic policy of never sending weapons to conflict zones , saying the Russian invasion of Ukraine was an epochal moment that imperiled the entire post-World War II order and threatened security across Europe , according to their statement reported by Politico .\nIMAGE : Ukrainian Defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Christine Lambrecht , met Tuesday at the U.S. Air Force base in Ramstein , Germany .\nEventually , Berlin finally bowed to that pressure .\nThe decision was an abrupt change in course , coming after Berlin clung to its initial position for weeks despite huge Russian advances , and relentless pressure from EU and NATO allies .\nFrom its own stockpile , the German government will send 1,000 anti-tank weapons , and 500 Stinger anti-aircraft defense systems to Ukraine .\nThe FIM-92 Stinger is a man-portable air-defense system ( MANPADS ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missile ( SAM ) .\nIt can be adapted to fire from a wide variety of ground vehicles and helicopters .\nIMAGE : Stinger anti-aircraft defense systems / \u2019 Cheetah \u2019 also known as the Flakpanzer Gepard .\nThe German government has decided to allow on Tuesday 26th April , the export of anti-aircraft armored \u201c Cheetah \u201d fighting vehicles , better known as the \u201c Flakpanzer Gepard.\n\u201d This self-propelled anti-aircraft gun has been decommissioned by the German armed forces and will now be refurbished and sent to Ukraine , \u201d said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defence minister also said that Berlin was working with US to train Ukrainian soldiers on German soil .\nIt is yet to be seen if Germany \u2019 s 1970s era Gepard tanks will actually make a difference in the context of Ukraine war theater .\nIn the final report to the Prosecutor by the Committee Established to Review the NATO Bombing Campaign Against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Kosovo war ) , evidence of use of depleted uranium ( DU ) projectiles by NATO aircraft during the bombing campaign is acknowledged .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ ban on the use of DU projectiles actually exists .\nThere is a developing scientific debate and concern expressed regarding the impact of the use of such weapons , and it is possible that , in the future , there will be a consensus view in international legal circles that the use of such projectiles violates general principles of both domestic and international law applicable to use of weapons in armed conflict .\nFinally , it is also acknowledged that analysis undertaken with regard to environmental damage would apply , mutatis mutandis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by NATO .\nFurthermore , in the report we can read the committee shot down a potential OTP investigation before it even started .\nOne would hope that we could learn our lessons of history and past wars , and perhaps the following the ominous warnings issued in this article , \u201c The Depleted Uranium Weapons : Lessons from the 1991 Gulf War \u201d .\nSince their first use during the Gulf War by the US and UK , depleted uranium weapons have since been deployed as well in Bosnia , Serbia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Iraq by the US and UK from 2003 onwards .\nThere is also a suspicion that the US have used DU in Afghanistan from 2001 , although this has been routinely denied by the government .\nIts dangers can not be understated : it produces an oxide dust while burning , and so this dust simply can not be inhaled and retained by the lungs \u2013 which will lead to uranium deposits left in the lymph nodes , bones , brain and testes .\nA sharp increase in various cancers , breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as birth defects has been observed in the countries where DU has been used .\nKnowing this , we must then consider the reckless actions of governments involved , and of organisations like NATO , all of whom seem content to turn a blind eye to this issue .\nThe effects on the troops themselves is also endemic .\nThere have been numerous incidents of deleterious health effects from exposure of depleted uranium on military personnel as well as civilians , including devastating respiratory disease , gastrointestinal problems , neurological disorders , kidney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and various forms of cancer and birth defects .\nA number of leukemia deaths within a year among 60,000 Italian soldiers serving in Kosovo have been linked to depleted uranium .\nFor those interested in reading more about the health effects associated with depleted uranium weapons , I invite you to read the following study from M. Ragheb which provides a more scientific approach and an open discussion on the topics of DU : While we were initially focusing on France \u2019 s DU weaponry being shipping into Ukraine , it \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US , UK , Sweden , and possibly Germany \u2013 are also trafficking vast amounts of deadly depleted uranium products into that country .\nBy the time this latest war is over , it is very likely that the amount of DU material released in Ukraine may surpass levels seen in the Yugoslavian War , and the Iraq wars .\nHow long will international human rights , anti-war , and nonproliferation organizations stay silent on this crucial issue ?\nThe lack of any treaty regulating the use of DU , and the curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanitarian law ( IHL ) treaties have created a legal lacuna concerning the use of DU in military training , and especially international armed conflicts ( IAC ) or non-international armed conflicts ( NIAC ) .\nAs most armed conflicts in the contemporary world are often non-international in nature , but with certain cross-border elements , it raises question whether a common international framework to regulate DU in IAC and NIAC is required .\nIn addition , much more research is needed to better understand the adverse effects resulting from the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consensus to seriously regulate or prohibit its use .\nSpecial thanks to Florent Pirot for his amazing work and relentless efforts for exposing Governments and NATO armed forces \u2019 use of depleted uranium ( DU ) and much more .\nPlease check his blog here and

Ukraine: Sleepy Joe\u2019s $33 Billion Abomination", "content": "Once again , war fever has gripped Europe and North America , with the US and NATO saying they are ready to back Ukraine in their proxy war against Russia \u201c for years.\n\u201d Only , this open-ended proxy conflict will not end well for the West , or Ukraine .\nDonald Trump has been well relegated to the sidelines of America \u2019 s political debate , but the TDS ( Trump Derangement Syndrome ) lives on , more virulent than ever .\nThe latter is what \u2019 s behind Washington \u2019 s descent into the current mindless Ukraine war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the post-9/11 hysteria seem like an orderly discourse .\nAt the center of this madness , of course , is Vladimir Putin , the Devil Incarnate .\nPrior to February 24th he had attained that designation in Imperial Washington not just because of his rough methods of governance in Russia or small time military forays in the 2008 South Ossetia/Georgia dispute or in putting down alleged terrorists in Chechnya , but because according to the RussiaGate hoax he had thrown the election to Donald Trump in 2016 , thereby shockingly interrupting the rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the next four years the apparatus of official Washington\u2013including the MSM in cahoots with the national security state\u2014did not cease in its vilification of Putin via the running RussiaGate Hoax , the phony Mueller investigation , the rogue impeachment proceedings and the nonstop MSM linkage of Trump \u2019 s unwelcome presence in the Oval Office with the nefarious doings of Vlad Putin .\nAt length , the TDS got so virulent and all-consuming inside the beltway that the resulting enmity toward Donald Trump became coterminous with the demonization of Putin .\nConsequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage ( barely ) by the American electorate in November 2020 , Washington \u2019 s war on the Donald simply got re-focused with fevered intensity on Putin .\nIn the target practice galleries of Washington politics , Vlad became the Donald \u2019 s avatar .\nNeedless to say , with the politicians in both parties foaming at the mouth against Putin , the Deep State and military-industrial complex had a field day hyping Russia into a national security threat that was not remotely justified , but which did massively distort policy .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloated national security budget even further to $ 813 billion in the FY 2023 Biden request ; stonewalling Russia \u2019 s reasonable proposals of December to reset security arrangements in eastern Europe , which would have precluded the devastation now besetting Ukraine entirely ; and , after February 24th , turning the intramural dispute between Russia and its historic vassal and step-child , Ukraine , into a purported history-defining contest between peaceful Democracy and belligerent Autocracy\u2014a struggle that justified launching a global Sanctions War against the very essence of the dollar-based payments and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenuous prosperity precariously rests .\nAs a result of TDS-come-Putinphobia , Washington is now on a doomsday path that has no rational end game except the risk of WW III , even though the objective facts of the matter scream in the opposite direction .\nThat is to say , in an objective and rational world , Washington would not be touching the Russia/Ukraine dispute with a 100-foot pole because it implicates nothing of consequence for America \u2019 s homeland security .\nIn the first instance , Russia is not a direct military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancy new weapons and ultra high speed missiles .\nAmerica \u2019 s triad nuclear defense is still fully in tact and is as lethal as ever .\nThat means as between Russia and the US on the nuclear front , mutual assured destruction ( MAD ) still prevails , meaning that Russia would never launch a nuclear attack against America because of all the things Putin is , suicidal is not one of them .\nBy the same token , the idea that Russia poses a credible conventional military threat to the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now laughable .\nIn ten weeks it has not been able to subdue a weak neighbor with which it shares a 1,900 Km open land border ( no mountains , no waterways , no walls ! )\n.\nSo where in the world comes the historically unprecedented armada of carrier battle groups , massive air fleets and endless divisions of tanks and mechanized infantry required to invade and occupy the US of A , located is it is 8,000 Km away on the far side of central Eurasia and beyond the great Atlantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GDP of Russia is $ 1.6 trillion versus $ 24 trillion for the US .\nAnd for better or worse a Russian attack on America would bring NATO \u2019 s article 5 into play , thereby mobilizing $ 43 trillion of total NATO GDP , which is 27X more economic girth than possessed by Russia ; and also $ 1.2 trillion of combined NATO military budgets , which is 18X Russia \u2019 s $ 65 billion military budget .\nSo , no , there is no plausible Russian military threat to the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scary story stuff arises entirely from the fictional realm of lurid Warfare State propaganda .\nFor instance , there is the baseless notion that Ukraine is just a stepping stone in Putin \u2019 s grand plan for recreating the former Soviet Union .\nAnd unimpeded in Ukraine , he would not hesitate to roll through Poland , the Baltics and the Balkans in the creation of an empire that would eventually dominate Western Europe , too , leaving the US all alone , cowering behind the Atlantic and Pacific shorelines .\nAlas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the unalloyed humbug of retired military officers and deep staters who are paid by think tanks and the MSM to scare the living daylights out of the public and the politicians alike .\nIn turn , that \u2019 s so they will more readily acquiesce to the $ 813 billion of military budgets that are not only a colossal waste , but a fount of the schemes and threats which actually undermine national security .\nThe Washington sponsored Maidan coup of February 2014 , which fractured Ukraine \u2019 s fragile polity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian speaking Donbas that has now morphed into a prelude to WW III , is only the latest example .\nThe fact is , Putin is a Churchill level historian and the Russian leadership still has memory muscle that goes back to Soviet times .\nThey know that Poland , the Baltics and much of the non-Serbian Balkans is a hotbed of deep anti-Russian sentiment that would make even an attempt at conquest a bloody , economically draining fiasco .\nPutin may not appeal to the sensibilities of the dandies who scribble out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Foreign Relations , but his methodical crushing of the Ukrainian resistance demonstrates that he is the Cool Hand Vlad of the present era .\nAs such , he is not about to fall for hopelessly impossible enterprises like the recreation of the old Soviet Union .\nTo the contrary , his operation in Ukraine is not the prelude to recreating the Soviet Union , but the coda to unfinished business in the 1300-year history of Russia and its \u201c borderlands \u201d , the latter term being the Russian meaning of the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any current map of the battle front in Ukraine , and what lies on the Russian controlled side to the east and along the shorelines of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov shows up as \u201c Novorossiya \u201d ( \u201c New Russia \u201d ) on any map made between 1764 and 1917 .\nEven here , it is not crude Russian revanchism that motivated Putin \u2019 s desperate last resort invasion of February 24th ; it was for better or worse , Moscow \u2019 s frustration with the relentless push of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis , and the relentless assault on the Russian speaking populations of the Donbas that over the eight years after the February 2014 coup had led to upwards of 14,000 civilian deaths and the utter destruction of towns and cities in the breakaway Republics every bit as horrific as the nightly MSM fare with respect to Russian bombing on the other side of the battle front .\nSo in a world not besotted with the TDS , the alternative course of action would be straight forward .\nNo Washington sanctions ; no taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age-old disputes between Russia and its vassal ; no supplying of weapons to the hopelessly outgunned Ukraine military that only prolongs the war ; and a complete Washington renunciation of any interest in extending NATO to Ukraine or other ex-Soviet Republics , along with a pullback of US forces and missile installations from former Warsaw Pact countries that are now members of NATO .\nUnder that non-TDS scenario , this is what Washington would do in the name of homeland security and it would bring an end to the war and the pointless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Needless to say , under this benign scenario , Joe Biden would not be asking Congress for $ 33 billion of additional Ukraine war funding , including more than $ 20 billion in \u201c security and military assistance , \u201d $ 8.5 billion in economic aid , and $ 3 billion in \u201c humanitarian assistance \u201d And , of course , this comes on top of the $ 4.6 billion in security assistance the US has given Ukraine since January 2021 , including $ 3.7 billion since Russian forces invaded the country in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abomination , midwifed by the TDS and resulting irrational demonization of Putin .\nYet the truth is , America \u2019 s homeland security does not require that a single dime be spent on Ukraine !\nLikewise , it also most definitely does not require a single Congressional cowboy or cowgirl to be visiting a remote corner of the earth that does not have a damn thing to do with the security , liberty and prosperity of the American people .\nAs it was , the crew pictured above spent a little over three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glorified photo-op and \u201c ata boy \u201d .\nThe delegation included a \u201c who \u2019 s who \u201d of the Dem House leadership\u2014none of whom had the slightest idea of where they were as a historical matter or understood that the silly marionette they meet with had nothing more in mind than dragging America into a shooting war that is none

arms from NATO and the urgent return to the conference table to negotiate an end to the carnage\u2014even if it meant that partition of Ukraine , which after all that has now transpired can not be

wrong and so his solutions are wrong too .\nBut the drinks are good , and he is buying .\nSo you put up with it .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole thing in the morning .\nIn the morning , however , you realize that he is one of the world \u2019 s richest men and he is pulling the strings of many of the world \u2019 s most powerful people .\nNow you are alarmed .\nIn a nutshell , that \u2019 s what it \u2019 s like to read Bill Gates \u2019 s new book How to Prevent the Next Pandemic .\nThe main theme is implied in the title .\nWith enough money , intelligence , and power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the next pathogen to come along can be stopped in its tracks .\nWhere the bug goes after that he never explains .\nPresumably it just disappears .\nLike a computer virus , it exists but doesn \u2019 t ruin your hard drive .\nWhat are the historical examples of such a thing ?\nThere are none via avoidance , testing , contract tracing , and control of the human population .\nThis theory of virus control \u2013 the notion that muscling the population makes a prevalent virus shrink into submission and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the mechanization of a primitive instinct .\nSmallpox occupies a unique position among infectious diseases as the only one affecting humans that has been eradicated .\nThere are reasons for that : a stable pathogen , a great vaccine , and a hundred years of focused public health work .\nThis happened not due to lockdowns but from the careful and patient application of traditional public-health principles .\nCan that same experience be repeated in every case ?\nIt \u2019 s worth investigating and thinking about .\nThe reason is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal avoidance could be worse than allowing endemicity to it to develop throughout the population .\nEradication is not the same thing as perpetual pathogenic avoidance .\nThe former is great but the latter is deeply dangerous : the only thing more dangerous to human life than governments is a naive immune system .\nGates \u2019 s plan , even if it had a chance of working which it does not , could create exactly that .\nNot to understand the difference is an egregious intellectual error .\nThe error here probably traces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He doesn \u2019 t say this in the book but it becomes very apparent that he thinks a biological virus works just like a computer \u201c virus.\n\u201d He seems not to know that the application of this term to computing is purely metaphorical .\nThe goal of computer security is to block all viruses no matter what .\nApplying that same principle to human biology would create calamity .\nThat \u2019 s because pathogens do not disappear when everyone complies with the rule of \u201c stay home and stay safe.\n\u201d They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for vulnerable people to infect .\nWith a virus like SARS-CoV2 , this keeps happening until we reach herd immunity .\nThe less exposed a population is to a mostly mild pathogen , the more vulnerable they are in the future to more severe outcomes .\nPlease don \u2019 t get bored with this review because you already know this .\nIt is taught to everyone in 9th grade biology class .\nAnd there \u2019 s no sense in repeating this here , much less explaining the basics of human immunology .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow avoided this knowledge his entire life .\nHe wants to scrub the human body the way he worked to scrub the Windows operating system .\nIt \u2019 s the kind of basic error anyone would make who has surrounded himself with sycophants for the better part of his career .\nIf you understand this one simple point about Gates \u2019 s thinking , you get the entire book .\nAll that matters is avoidance .\nThe more avoidance the better .\nThere is no such thing as being too free of pathogenic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal of all public health is to keep the population away from as many germs as possible .\nSo yes , I \u2019 m sorry to report that the entire book is a study in mysophobia ,

full-blown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eugenics , and countless dietary cults proves that .\nThe danger here of course is that they can also exercise outsized influence over others due purely to the size of their bank accounts and their demand that everyone around them behave in ways that are insufferably obsequious .\nTo be at such a dinner party with a person like this , having kissed the ring for hours , means breathing a huge sigh of relief once you are in the car headed home .\nIn any case , we all know that Gates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lockdown ideology .\nIt \u2019 s been going on for the better part of 15 years .\nNo surprise that has gained converts to this view .\nBut one might suppose that after the world calamity this ideology created , he would be rethinking things .\nMaybe he is just a bit .\nIt

public places were closed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed them to leave their homes every other day for thirty minutes at a time .\n\u2022 During the first wave of COVID , Denmark and Norway implemented strict lockdowns early on ( when fewer than thirty people in each country had been hospitalized ) , while the government of neighboring Sweden relied more on recommendations than requirements , keeping restaurants , bars , and gyms open and only encouraging but not requiring physical distancing .\nOne study found that if Sweden \u2019 s neighbors had followed its lead instead of locking down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times as many deaths as it did during the first wave , and Norway nine times as many as it did .\nAnother study estimated that NPIs in six large countries , including the United States , prevented nearly half a billion COVID infections in the first few months of 2020 alone .\n\u2022 Even though lockdowns have clear benefits for public health , it \u2019 s not always clear whether in lower-income countries they are worth the sacrifice .\nIn such places , closing down sectors of the economy can lead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poverty , and increase deaths from other causes .\nIf you \u2019 re a young adult and spend your day working outside\u2014as many people in low-income countries do\u2014COVID will not seem as scary as the possibility of not having enough food to feed your family .\n\u2022 The human suffering caused by these separations is incalculable , literally\u2014no one can put a number on the pain of not being able to say goodbye in person .\nBut the policy saved so many lives that it will be worth adopting again if the circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great example .\nThe evidence is clear that they reduce transmission , and that stricter lockdowns reduce transmission more than looser ones do .\nBut they \u2019 re not equally effective everywhere , because not everyone is able to comply by staying in one place .\n\u2022 Lockdowns may not be necessary in places where the disease burden is modest .\nThey \u2019 re also more effective in countries where residents have less of a voice in the country \u2019 s affairs , and the government is in a position to strictly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this all means is that there is no single ideal mix of NPIs that works equally well everywhere .\nContext matters , and protective measures need to be tailored for the places where they \u2019 ll be used .\n\u2022 This is good news , because NPIs are our most important tool in the early days of an outbreak .\nThere \u2019 s no lab time required to put mask mandates in place ( assuming we can provide the masks ) , figure out when to cancel big public events , or limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant .\n( Though we will need to make sure that whatever NPIs we deploy are appropriate to the pathogen we \u2019 re trying to stop . )\n\u2022 The economy was bad when businesses shut down , but it could have been even worse if the virus had been allowed to run rampant and kill millions more people than it already had .\nBy saving lives , lockdowns can make it possible to start the economic recovery sooner .\nAnd here he adds a little graphic .\n\u2022 The pandemic forced us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities .\nDigital alternatives that were once viewed as inferior were suddenly seen as preferable .\n\u2022 I want to add a caveat to the idea that long-term school closures shouldn \u2019 t be necessary .\nThat will be true if the next outbreak is one with a profile like COVID \u2019 s\u2014in particular , one that rarely makes kids severely ill .\nBut we have to be careful not to get caught fighting the last war .\nIf a future pathogen is markedly different from COVID\u2014if , for instance , its impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk/benefit calculus could change , and closing schools might be prudent .\nWe \u2019 ll need to stay flexible and , as always , follow the data .\n\u2022 Also , not all overreactions\u2014or apparent overreactions\u2014are created equal .\nClosing borders , for example , did slow the spread of COVID in some regions .\nBut border closures are a hammer that needs to be wielded very carefully .\nBy cutting off trade and tourism , they can crater a country \u2019 s economy so badly that the cure becomes worse than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how little we know about superspreaders .\nWhat role does biology play ?\nAre some people more prone to being a superspreader than others ?\nThere \u2019 s also certainly a behavioral component .\nSuperspreaders seem not to pose more of a risk to small groups than other infected people do , but in crowded indoor public spaces , such as bars and restaurants , there \u2019 s a better chance that you \u2019 ll encounter one or more superspreaders , and they \u2019 ll have the opportunity to infect a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysteries of disease transmission that needs a lot more study .\n\u2022 In the meantime , the six-foot rule is a good one to follow , unless it \u2019 s very difficult to maintain , such as in a classroom .\nPeople need clear , easily remembered guidelines .\nIt is not a helpful public health message to say , \u201c Keep your distance , but the exact distance depends on the situation , so it might be three feet , or six feet , or maybe more.\n\u201d \u2022 The quick rollout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in large part why some countries , such as Australia , had dramatically fewer infections and excess deaths than others .\nGovernments need to learn from these examples and figure out how they will ramp up testing very quickly\u2014and give people an incentive to get tested by also offering treatment to anyone who tests positive and is at significant risk of severe disease .\n\u2022 This is a little hard to admit , because the power of inventing things is so central to my worldview , but it \u2019 s true : We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective way to block the transmission of certain respiratory viruses than a piece of inexpensive material with a couple of elastic straps sewn onto it .\n\u2022 The real benefit comes with universal masking , where both people are double masking or improving the fit of their surgical masks : It reduces the risk of exposure by 96 percent .\nThat \u2019 s an incredibly effective intervention that can be manufactured for just a few cents .\n\u2022 If everyone had masked up early on\u2014and if the world had had enough supplies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread of COVID dramatically .\nI \u2019 m not going to fact check the above simply because we do this every day on Brownstone .\nSuffice it to say that much of what he claims is unproven or completely false .\nWhat matters here is the big picture .\nTo me , he seems to be saying that in an ideal world , we would live with rolling lockdowns forever , on the say-so of experts in his pay .\nIndeed , he proposes the creation of a new division of the World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nJust in case you think this is about helping sick people to get well , Gates corrects you : \u201c You might have noticed one obvious activity that \u2019 s missing from GERM \u2019 s job description : treating patients .\nThat \u2019 s by design.\n\u201d Presumably , if we can ever claw our way back to traditional public health , we will also return to things like treating patients rather than brutalizing populations in the name of achieving what is not only impossible but also undesirable : the creation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more extensive critique , especially the claim that urbanization and travel make the world a dirtier and less healthy place , a view exactly aligned with Fauci \u2019 s own .\nThe opposite is likely true but you have to have the subtle mind of Sunetra Gupta to understand why .\nAll that said , I \u2019 m glad Gates put pen to paper .\nJust like finding yourself sitting at a bar with a crazy person , such an experience can be very interesting , provided the drinks are flowing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just don \u2019 t put them in charge of anything .\nOtherwise , we will in fact lose all voice in public affairs , exactly as Gates seems to desire .\nJeffrey A.

(And How Much Time is Left?)", "content": "I have been warning about an inevitable East vs. West economic war for many years now .\nThe question was never a matter of likelihood , it was always just a matter of timing .\nWhen would the most convenient time be for World War III ?\nThe issue of \u201c convenience \u201d might sound odd , but I want readers to remember one rule : All wars are banker wars .\nThere is nothing you can not eventually understand in terms of geopolitics as long as you accept the fact that international conflicts are generally engineered and always designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power brokers and financial elites .\nIf you are one of those people who assume all of these events are merely \u201c random and unfortunate coincidence \u201d then you \u2019 ll remain in the dark for the rest of your life \u2013 and will never grasp why terrible things are happening to you as the world falls apart .\nYou will go to an early grave because you were unprepared while still thinking you were the smartest person in the room .\nIn my article Order out of Chaos : How the Ukraine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I outlined the many factors that tie the Kremlin to globalist institutions like the World Economic Forum ( WEF ) , the Bank of International Settlements ( BIS ) , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , elitists like Henry Kissinger and international banks like Goldman Sachs .\nThe reality is , Russia has long been attached to globalist interests and this is not going to change because of the war in Ukraine , just as it did not change after Russia annexed Crimea .\nChina is , of course , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ globalist institutions .\nThe nation accrued trillions of dollars in debt because this is a prerequisite for joining the IMF \u2019 s Special Drawing Rights ( SDR ) basket of currencies .\nYes , China went from being a nation of minimal debt to being trillions in the red just because the IMF demands \u201c liquidity \u201d for a nation \u2019 s currency to be considered viable for their global centralization initiative .\nThis is not the behavior of a country that is anti-globalist .\nI \u2019 m not going to continue rehashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attachments to the globalists here .\nI \u2019 ve already done that for well over a decade , and frankly I grow tired of having to rehash the lessons that brilliant researchers like Antony Sutton expertly addressed back before I was born .\nIf there \u2019 s a major war , then there are globalists behind it influencing both sides and seeking to gain more power .\nIf you haven \u2019 t figured this out by now , then you never will .\nHere \u2019 s what war is good for Why engineer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play both sides of a chess game , you always end up the winner .\nBeyond that , chaos is the ultimate recipe for advancing draconian agendas that the public would never allow to pass during peacetime .\nWhat I want to examine here instead is the issue of timing and development ; how is this massive economic war going to play out , and how long will it take to happen ?\nOnce we understand the stages , maybe we can brace for impact and take actions to change the outcome .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ball is in the court of eastern nations and that their actions will dictate the pace of events .\nThe economic lesson the West has forgotten True wealth has nothing to do with money or debt creation ; true wealth comes from resources , the means of production and labor .\nThis is something the Marxists actually got right in their philosophy ; the problem is that Marxists are only interested in ways to steal labor , resources and production while making the public think that such theft is a good thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real wealth is .\nYou can have all the money in the world but if you have no manufacturing base or resource development then you have nothing .\nIt \u2019 s as simple as that .\nIf a nation has no real wealth and no means of creating it , no printing press is going to save its economy .\nThe West has abandoned much of its means of production and has crippled the exploration of its own resources through fake environmental concerns like \u201c carbon pollution.\n\u201d The East has not done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way that affects long term productivity .\nTherefore , the East is in the strongest position to survive a global economic conflict .\nBut the real key to the progression of an economic world war is the combination of countries involved and their trade agreements .\nRussia and China , for example , have been developing bilateral trade meant to cut out the U.S. dollar for many years now .\nRussia is resource-rich , and China has the world \u2019 s largest manufacturing and export base .\nAn alliance makes perfect economic sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened .\nOnly weeks before the invasion of Ukraine , Russia signed a 30-year oil and gas contract with China worth hundreds of billions of dollars .\nThis deal coincides with the construction of a major pipeline from Russia to China which will be completed by 2025 .\nIndia also made arrangements for increased oil shipments from Russia , and will pay without the dollar ( formerly the world \u2019 s sole petro-currency ) .\nFurthermore , the promise of lower prices while the rest of the oil world is experiencing rapid inflation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those purchasing oil , natural gas or coal from Russia .\nThe other nations of the BRICS bloc ( Brazil , India , China and South Africa ) have all been highly active in trade with Russia despite western sanctions and the removal of Russian banks from the SWIFT international payments network .\nThis is exactly what I predicted would happen many years ago .\nBut how does this trading bloc affect the time frame of the world war ?\nIt has been my belief that the real target of this war is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. dollar and the American economy .\nYes , there will be far-reaching financial consequences beyond the U.S. , but our economy is the only economy that is completely reliant on our currency \u2019 s global reserve status .\nA world war using economic weapons and tactics is the worst type of war we could fight because it is not a war we can win .\nThe dollar \u2019 s global reserve status is our Achilles heel .\nIt is not a strength , but a weakness .\nWhile all eyes are on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other side of the planet , very few realize that the worst damage is going to hit us right here at home .\nThe sanctions on Russia are only a part of the problem , as this is creating momentum towards a general decoupling from the dollar trade .\nThe bigger issue is the BRICS nations ( and their export/import partners ) who will refuse to accept sanctions because they are economically dependent on each other .\nOne example is the recent announcement by Hungary that they plan to refuse any cuts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nBecause this would cause an energy crisis in their country , one they couldn \u2019 t recover from .\nMany other nations are following this logic around the world , and if NATO is going to continue pushing for economic isolation of Russia , then those countries will invariably stop using the dollar as their reserve currency .\nWhy \u201c invariably , \u201d you might ask \u2013 why does Russia \u2019 s economic isolation lead to the end of the dollar \u2019 s global reserve status ?\nHere \u2019 s why : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union ( EU ) sanctioned Russia , they also froze Russia \u2019 s U.S. dollar accounts and terminated Russia \u2019 s connection with the international payments platform .\nThis was a very clear method of coercion !\nIt \u2019 s as though Biden called up Putin and told him , \u201c Get out of Ukraine or else .\nThat \u2019 s a real nice economy you got there .\nBe a shame if something , ah , happened to it\u2026 \u201d The rest of the world watched the West financially cancel Russia with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This act of economic warfare revealed a nearly-unthinkable conclusion : If they did it to Russia , they could do it to us , too\u2026 Dylan Grice of Calderwood Capital put this in more stark terms : In other words , the establishment elites in the US and Europe are creating the conditions which can destroy the dollar .\nThe dollar \u2019 s status is entirely dependent on faith and belief in its demand .\nIf demand for dollars wavers because of global sanctions , then all those trillions of greenbacks held in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. , shoving the nation deeper into stagflationary crisis .\nThe globalists are perfectly aware that this will be the consequence .\nIn fact , they \u2019 re counting on it .\nWe have eight years to prepare The year 2030 is consistently mentioned by the United Nations , the IMF , the WEF and the rest of the cabal of globalist institutions as the final milestone for their Great Reset agenda .\nIf a global economic crisis is the catalyst as it appears to be , then several years would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 along with the introduction of a \u201c solution \u201d to the problem .\nThis means that the economic war will have to accelerate quickly going into the next year .\nToday we are already seeing 40 year highs in inflation , along with considerable supply chain disruptions .\nMultiple globalist foundations are \u201c predicting \u201d food shortages around the world in the next 3-6 months .\nI believe the war itself will expand rapidly within a year to include China , and most of the damage will be done by the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on how fast exporters ( mainly China ) dump the dollar ; the dollar dump will be the primary trigger .\nA significant part of the WEF \u2019 s Great Reset agenda and the IMF \u2019 s Special Drawing Rights global digital currency initiative would require the end of the dollar as the world \u2019 s reserve currency .\nThis is a process the globalists have been talking about openly for some time .\nIt \u2019 s not \u201c conspiracy theory , \u201d it is conspiracy reality .\nThe IMF has argued on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be \u201c managed \u201d by a centralized entity that can prevent national governments from exploiting currency trade for their own ends , and this includes digital currencies .\nThe stage is already set for this narrative .\nThe U.S. will be painted as an example of why nationalism is a \u201c path to disaster \u201d and why no single nation should be trusted with so much power in the form of a world reserve currency .\nThat kind of power tempts governments not only into excessive money creation power debt-financed spending sprees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay for those old debts , thus debasing and degrading the dollar \u2019 s purchasing power worldwide ( also known as inflation ) .\nBut look at what the U.S. did to Russia \u2013 freezing bank accounts and canceling credit cards of the world \u2019 s 10th largest economy .\nThe globalists would call this an abuse of power .\nThroughout history , global reserve currencies have risen and fallen .\nFrom the Greek drachma in the 5th century B.C .\nto the British pound sterling ( 1700-1931 ) , every single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implosion of a reserve currency spreads like a tsunami , wrecking economies worldwide .\nThus , it is only \u201c logical \u201d that a global central authority with no national loyalties be put in control of an \u201c international \u201d reserve currency , right ?\nMaybe a multi-currency-based basket system , or , perhaps , a single world currency\u2026 To prevent any future tragedies and abuses of power from ever happening again .\nRight ?\nWorld war , whether economic or kinetic , and the death of the dollar as the global reserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c perfectly rational \u201d introduction of an international financial oligarchy .\nAnd , unlike its predecessors , this ruling council would operate right out in the sun for everyone to see , not in the shadows deep in the bowels of central banking cartels .\nTheir authority would be \u201c official , \u201d and their control established as necessary , even vital for world peace .\nThis is the same thing that has happened after every major war or world war ; the argument is made that national sovereignty was the cause and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when people are left to organize into groups they might form differing ideas on how to live , and differing ideas cause conflict .\nAfter World War I , they introduced the League of Nations .\nAfter World War II , they established the UN and the IMF .\nAnd , after economic World War III , they will try to implement a program of one world currency and global economic governance ( and dominance , as well ) .\nGlobalists claim it is better for there to be no sovereignty , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We need one homogeneous global collective with a single hive mind , \u201d goes the argument , \u201c so that no conflict ever happens.\n\u201d Of course , they get to have their own group , and that group intends to garner all the benefits of the crisis and the power that will be derived from the panic .\nI strongly recommend you prepare yourself , and your family , for the end of the U.S. dollar \u2019 s global reserve status .\nThat means securing your financial future with what \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d in other words , physical gold and silver .\nPhysical precious metals are safe from hacking , immune to the collapse of the electrical grid and will very likely always be worth something , which is more than we can say for the vast majority of the fallen currencies .\nThey \u2019 re a solid financial foundation to build your future on , whatever the future brings .\nTake yourself off the dollar standard before the globalists do it for you \u2013 because once they come for your dollars , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warning , I leave you with a quote from

, according to a nonprofit government watchdog .\n\u201c We estimate that up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third parties were paid to NIH scientists during the fiscal years between 2010 and 2020 , \u201d Open the Books CEO Adam Andrzejewski told reporters in a telephone news conference on May 9 .\n\u201c We draw that conclusion because , in the first five years , there has been $ 134 million that we have been able to quantify of top-line numbers that flowed from third-party payers , meaning pharmaceutical companies or other payers , to NIH scientists.\n\u201d The first five years , from 2010 to 2014 , constitute 40 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c We now know that there are 1,675 scientists that received payments during that period , at least one payment .\nIn fiscal year 2014 , for instance , $ 36 million was paid out and that is on average $ 21,100 per scientist , \u201d Andrzejewski said .\n\u201c We also find that during this period , leadership at NIH was involved in receiving third-party payments .\nFor instance , Francis Collins , the immediate past director of NIH , received 14 payments .\nDr. Anthony Fauci received 23 payments and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payments.\n\u201d Collins resigned as NIH director in December 2021 after 12 years of leading the world \u2019 s largest public health agency .\nFauci is the longtime head of NIH \u2019 s National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) , as well as chief medical adviser to President Joe Biden .\nLane is the deputy director of NIAID , under Fauci .\nThe top five NIH employees measured in terms of the number of royalty payments that they received while on the government payroll , according to a fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include Robert Gallo , National Cancer Institute , 271 payments ; Ira Pastan , National Cancer Institute , 250 payments ; Mikulas Popovic , National Cancer Institute , 191 payments ; Flossie Wong-Staal , National Cancer Institute , 190 payments ; and Mangalasseril Sarngadharan , National Cancer Institute , 188 payments .\nOnly Pastan continues to be employed by NIH , according to Open the Books .\n\u201c When an NIH employee makes a discovery in their official capacity , the NIH owns the rights to any resulting patent .\nThese patents are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could use them to bring products to market , \u201d the fact sheet reads .\n\u201c Employees are listed as inventors on the patents and receive a share of the royalties obtained through any licensing , or \u2018 technology transfer , \u2019 of their inventions .\nEssentially , taxpayer money funding NIH research benefits researchers employed by NIH because they are listed as patent inventors and therefore receive royalty payments from licensees.\n\u201d An NIH spokesman didn \u2019 t respond by press time to a request for comment .\nAndrzejewski told reporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NIH royalty payments in 2005 , including specific details about who got how much from which payers for what work , that the agency is denying to Open the Books in 2022 .\n\u201c At that time , we knew there were 918 scientists , and each year , they were receiving approximately $ 9 million , on average with each scientist receiving $ 9,700 .\nBut today , the numbers are a lot larger with the United States still in a declared national health emergency .\nIt \u2019 s quite obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot larger , \u201d Andrzejewski said .\nHe said the files Open the Books is receiving\u2014300 pages of line-by-line data\u2014are \u201c heavily redacted.\n\u201d \u201c These are not the files the AP received in 2005 where everything was disclosed\u2014the scientist \u2019 s name , the name of the third-party payer , the amount of the royalty paid by the payer to the scientist , \u201d Andrzejewski said .\n\u201c Today , NIH is producing a heavily redacted database ; we don \u2019 t know the payment amount to the scientist , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third-party payer , all of that is being redacted.\n\u201d Federal officials are allowed to redact information from responses to FOIA requests if the release of the data would harm a firm \u2019 s commercial privilege .\nThe undisclosed royalty payments are inherent conflicts of interest , Andrzejewski said .\n\u201c We believe there is an unholy conflict of interest inherent at NIH , \u201d he said .\n\u201c Consider the fact that each year , NIH doles out $ 32 billion in grants to approximately 56,000 grantees .\nNow we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to be approximately $ 350 million flowing the other way from third-party payers , many of which receive NIH grants , and those payments are flowing back to NIH scientists and leadership.\n\u201d Fauci and Lane told AP that they agreed there was an appearance of a conflict of interest in getting the royalties , with Fauci saying that he contributed his royalties to charity .\nLane didn \u2019 t do that , according to Andrzejewski .\nThe governing ethics financial disclosure form in the past defined the royalty payments as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant the recipients weren \u2019 t required to list their payments on the form .\nBut Andrzejewski said NIH has refused to respond to his request for clarification on the disclosure issue .\n\u201c If they are not , none of these payments are receiving any scrutiny whatsoever and to the extent that a company making payments to either leadership or scientists , while also receiving grants \u2026 then that just on its face is a conflict of interest , \u201d he said .\nOpen the Books is a Chicago-based nonprofit government watchdog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of information laws to obtain and then post on the internet trillions of dollars in spending at all levels of government .\nThe nonprofit filed a federal Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) suit seeking documentation of all payments by outside firms to NIH and/or current and former NIH employees .\nNIH declined to respond to the FOIA , so Open the Books is taking the agency to court , suing

"21stcenturywire", "title": "Sleepwalking Into Disaster: How US Establishment Lost Fear of Escalating Ukraine Crisis", "content": "The following interview was originally published on Sputnik News , a website which is currently banned in UK .\nOn 9 May , US President Joe Biden signed a lend-lease Bill to streamline US lethal military aid to Ukraine , while the American press continues to present a one-sided picture of the Ukraine crisis .\nVladimir Golstein , associate professor at Brown University in Rhode Island , has explained why this approach is fraught with great risks for the US .\nSputnik : After the beginning of Russian special operation in Ukraine , US Big Tech labelled and banned major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department of Homeland Security has announced the creation of a so-called Disinformation Governance Board to fight \u201c Russian disinformation \u201d .\nWhat \u2019 s so scary about Russian news , in your opinion ?\nHow far can this go ?\nVladimir Golstein : This trend is highly disturbing , to say the least .\nAs is the case with all sorts of censorship , political in particular , it reveals the weakness of the censoring side .\nWhy are they afraid to discuss issues if they are convinced that they are doing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiding ?\nWhy are they afraid to be challenged ?\nNeedless to say , this idea of censorship goes against the most fundamental and cherished principles of the United States .\nThis is especially important , when the information which is being suppressed relates to a distant land and complex and highly contentious issues .\nAmericans have the right to know what kind of a cause their money is supporting , and what kind of cause is worth pursuing at the risk of global conflagration .\nThe whole idea of \u201c fake news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dubious .\nAny complex event has a multitude of manifestations and causes .\nThere is no single set of eyes that can see and register it all .\nAs St Paul observed , in the affairs of this world we see \u201c through a glass darkly \u201d , consequently , it is highly erroneous for one side to claim that they see clearly , whereas another side produces only fake news .\nBesides myopia and the self-defeating dimension of censorship , one should highlight two obvious facts related to censorship and the dismissal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , governments resort to this tactic to achieve some sort of consensus , which they don \u2019 t want to be challenged .\nIndeed , ever since the violent overthrow of the legitimate government in Kiev in 2014 , the western consensus has been established : \u201c Ukraine is resisting Russian aggression .\nThis aggression is getting more and more out of hand and is bound to spread further .\nTo stop it , we need a stronger NATO .\nSo , dear taxpayers , get ready to pay more for NATO expansion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Second , the war hysteria and the unchallenged demonisation of the other side serve one additional purpose : a diversion ; a diversion from all sorts of failures by the government .\nSo I am not surprised that numerous western governments , British and American in particular , have decided to resort to various forms of modern censorship for the sake of these two myopic goals : military build-up and diversion .\nSputnik : Adam Kinzinger ( the Republican Representative for Illinois \u2019 16th congressional district ) introduced an authorisation for use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would allow the US president to send US troops to Ukraine .\nDoes anyone among those supporting Kinzinger understand that this step could translate into all-out war between Russia and NATO ?\nVladimir Golstein : This political resolution is nothing but posturing .\nThe United States is not ready to send military forces to Ukraine , knowing very well that that would result in all-out war .\nAt least , top people in the government , the Pentagon in particular , are aware of that , and the president has been rather clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbing is the fact that Adam Kinzinger believes that he can get political momentum by acting as an even greater war-monger than the Democrats .\nHe obviously believes that the American campaign of demonising Russia has been so successful that his constituents would welcome further belligerent actions .\nHere again , we are dealing with the concrete results of the massive propaganda campaign undertaken by the US government along with all sorts of liberal outlets which used to be rather pacifist .\nIn recent years , however , the endless barrage of news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to carry two messages : first , Russians are barbaric and therefore performing all sorts of barbaric policies , including wars ; second , they are not competent at what they do and are therefore being defeated by the courageous Ukrainian forces .\nConsequently , Mr Kinzinger \u2019 s average voter concludes that if barbaric Russians can \u2019 t win against Ukraine , they are surely no match for the all-powerful American war machine .\nThus , there is no longer any fear connected with this war escalating to another level .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a well-known book by Christopher Clark on the history of the First World War called \u2018 The Sleepwalkers : How Europe Went to War in 1914 \u2019 .\nThat \u2019 s exactly what we are facing now : sleepwalking politicians , such as Mr Kinzinger , gain in popularity , while their voters sleepwalk into electing them , ignoring what unfolds in front of their own eyes .\nSputnik : Some observers say that the US and other NATO countries are already at war with Russia via their proxies in Ukraine .\nDo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s your take on Finland and Sweden \u2019 s NATO bid amid Russia \u2019 s special operation , which itself was triggered by NATO expansion ?\nVladimir Golstein : The nature of this proxy war is obvious , and it has been obvious to any unbiased observer .\nThe speed with which Ukraine has been armed by NATO , the provocative Ukrainian stance , the West \u2019 s refusal to engage in diplomacy , the well-organised sanction campaign , the all-powerful media blitzkrieg , and finally , the acknowledgment of the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to weaken Russia so it won \u2019 t be capable of any military action , all testify to the highly elaborate plans of subjugating Russia before tackling the next country that threatens NATO hegemony : China .\nNeedless to say , China is not interested in seeing Russia fall .\nRussia , China , India and other major countries are much more interested in a multi-polar world , and any action that would consolidate western leadership , such as further expanding NATO to include Finland and Sweden , are bound to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic to military pushback .\nFurther expansion of NATO means further undermining of the post-Second World War peace architecture , further escalation and military build-up , further abuse of valuable Earth resources for the sake of militarism .\nOne hopes that the depth and scope of these repercussions are made clear to the citizens of Sweden and Finland .\nUnfortunately , here we return to the issue of censorship and the dismissals of the Russian point of view .\nSomehow , Russian security concerns are consistently delegitimised in the western press , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis is highly regrettable and , more importantly , extremely dangerous .\nPoking a nuclear bear is one of the most idiotic things anyone can do , and Scandinavian people , who know Russians well , and who have been interacting with Russians for centuries , should know better .\nSputnik : What forces are interested in poking Russia , cancelling Russian culture , attacks on Russians abroad , further NATO expansion plans and arming Ukraine ?\nWhat goals are they trying to reach ?\nVladimir Golstein : Unfortunately , militarism remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people .\nDemonising Russia pays in all sorts of ways : it pays for the military industrial complex ; it pays for the press that loves hysteria and black-and-white stories of the evil Russians and their innocent victims ; it pays for the politicians who expect to ride and exploit this war of the Slavs for their own benefit ; and last , but not least , it pays for the military strategists who know that taking on both Russia and China to reassert American supremacy is a complicated if not an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia and gaining access to its resources is a much more reasonable undertaking .\nConsequently , too many people with access to power are interested in further escalation , in further expanding this proxy war .\nIt is the task of Russia to provide an adequate response without bringing the world to the brink of the Third World War .\nOne hopes that Russian success in Ukraine will make NATO leaders rethink their strategies .\nOtherwise , the poking of Russia will continue , ushering in everything from a nuclear war to Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HELP SUPPORT OUR INDEPENDENT MEDIA PLATFORM HERE", "author": "Wire HQ",

his paper with this quote from a psychiatrist and four colleagues : \u2018 More than 92 million benzodiazepine prescriptions are yearly dispensed in the US yet little is known about the experiences of those taking them.\n\u2019 These words infuriated me .\nHow can these people not know the history of these drugs ?\nHere \u2019 s an extract from my recent book The Benzos Story which is available as a paperback .\n\u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medicine Men was published .\nHere is what I wrote about tranquillisers in the benzodiazepine group ( drugs such as diazepam and lorazepam ) : \u2018 There is little doubt that many of the least necessary prescriptions are for psychotropic drugs .\nSomething like 17 % of all prescriptions signed in America in 1970 were for psychotropic drugs , and in the United Kingdom the figure for the same year was nearer to 19 per cent .\nThe percentage seems to be rising annually and there is little doubt that psychotropic drugs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 47 million prescriptions handed out for psychotropic drugs in England and Wales in 1970 was over \u00a320 million .\nIt has been estimated that over 3,000 million psychotropic tablets are dispensed every year in England and Wales .\nThe market for these drugs , given for the sole purpose of helping patients who are anxious or depressed or who are unable to get to sleep at night , is so enormous and is growing so rapidly that almost every manufacturer of drugs in the world produces its share of psychotropic drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not normally take tablets of any kind and who condemn those who take cannabis or alcohol , happily take psychotropics , with the result that the world \u2019 s biggest addiction problem is not teenagers taking hash but middle-agers taking sedatives .\nPeople in

school teachers all swallow their capsules three times a day without regret .\nIt has been said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were banned from driving or operating machinery , the world \u2019 s economy would collapse .\nThe tranquilliser is replacing tobacco .\nIt will perhaps give us an even bigger problem .\nIt may prove even more dangerous .\nAlready Valium is said to be taken by 14 % of the population in Britain , 17 % in Belgium and France , 15 % in Denmark , 10 % in Italy and Spain , 14 % in Germany and 10 % in America.\n\u2019 \u2018 The habit usually starts insidiously .\nThe patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few tablets .\nA close friend or relative had died or there is a rush on at work .\nAnd the doctor finds it difficult to refuse a request for a little help .\nBoth patient and doctor forget that depression and anxiety are normal , healthy human emotions .\nThe drugs which people take to relieve their pressures vary .\nIf he is young the addict may take drugs from a pusher .\nIf he is older he may take drugs from a medical adviser.\n\u2019 \u2018 We can , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this absurd and sad state of affairs .\nThere are some people who make money out of dissatisfaction and unhappiness and whose business it is to convince us all that we are unhappy .\nMany advertising campaigns are aimed at exploiting man \u2019 s tendency to feel insecure .\nHis ordinary healthy worries are strengthened and exaggerated by advertisements which point out to him that he will not smell right if he does not use the right soap , that he will fall ill if he does not eat the right make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect if he does not wear the right clothes or drive the correct car .\n\u2018 When the unhappy consumer goes to see his doctor , he sees a man who has been pressured into believing that anxiety and depression are pathological .\nThe manufacturers of anxiolytics and anti-depressants have to sell their wares to the doctors who can prescribe them .\nSo a great deal of research is published to show that people who are anxious or depressed should be treated with medicines of one kind or another .\nAs a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn a patient away without pharmacological help.\n\u2019 Over the next few years I wrote dozens of newspaper and magazine articles and columns on the subject of benzodiazepine tranquillisers .\nI spoke about the problem frequently on television and on the radio .\nIn an article entitled \u2018 Life in Tablet Form \u2019 which appeared in the Daily Telegraph Magazine in 1976 I wrote angrily about the \u2018 overpopulated Slough of Despond .\nIn my third book , Stress Control , which was first published in 1978 , I pointed out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year for tranquillisers and sedatives and similar drugs \u2013 a fifth of all the prescriptions signed .\nAnd in an article published in the Daily Telegraph in 1978 I pointed out that many shoppers taking tranquillisers were being arrested for shoplifting .\nThe battle was not an easy one .\nOn many occasions I found myself battling against patients who firmly believed that the benzodiazepine tranquillisers were important , useful and safe .\nFor example , in 1982 I wrote a piece for the Daily Telegraph in which I pointed out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested that there was already much solid research available \u2018 to show that the symptoms of anxiety can be conquered by such simple , safe and uncomplicated solutions as relaxation therapy , meditation and daydreaming.\n\u2019 \u2018 These , \u2019 I wrote , \u2018 are the answers of the future.\n\u2019 Another writer working for the Daily Telegraph did not agree with me .\n\u2018 It \u2019 s about time someone said something in favour of Valium and similar drugs , \u2019 said Muriel King .\n\u2018 Over the past few years there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients taking medicine of this type from requesting repeat prescriptions , and even refusal of such requests.\n\u2019 \u2018 It really is unfair , \u2019 Ms King went on .\n\u2018 The Valium group of drugs are a source of immense comfort to many people .\nWithout them , the quality of their lives would plummet \u2013 if any sort of life were possible at all.\n\u2019 At times I despaired .\nToo often I found myself facing criticism from all quarters \u2013 drug companies , doctors and patients .\nBut by now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Others had begun to notice that the benzodiazepines were not just addictive \u2013 but that they also caused a wide range of damaging and uncomfortable symptoms .\nThere was widespread agreement that patients taking the drugs often suffered from depression , anxiety and sleeplessness \u2013 ironically the three symptoms for which the pills were most commonly prescribed .\nIn 1982 patients started forming Tranx groups to help one another beat their addictions .\n( Later , in 1984 , the BBC \u2019 s \u2018 Thats Life \u2019 television programme commissioned a survey of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . )\nBy now I was regularly getting letters from patients asking for advice and information about the problems produced by the benzodiazepines and wanting to know how they could \u2018 kick \u2019 the drug taking habit .\nIn 1982 I decided that I would write a book telling readers the truth about these drugs \u2013 and explaining the side effects associated with the drugs .\nI thought it was about time I attempted to summarise the information and experience I had collected over the years .\nI wrote a book called Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described the evidence that existed but also provided patients with advice on how best they could \u2018 kick \u2019 the tranquilliser habit .\nTo my surprise it was not easy to get the book published .\nSeveral London publishers insisted that there was no tranquilliser problem in Britain .\nOne mass market paperback editor insisted that the tranquilliser problem was over .\nAnother editor commissioned the book and then changed her mind , insisting that I was quite wrong about the problem .\nEventually the book was published in 1985 .\nThe response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the bestseller lists ( I later learned that the publisher had been so surprised that she had rung the \u2018 Sunday Times \u2019 to find out why the book was in their top ten bestselling books .\n\u2018 Because it \u2019 s selling so many copies \u2019 was their wonderfully simple answer ) .\nThe amount of mail I was getting from tranquilliser victims suddenly started to increase dramatically .\nIn a single month I received well over 6,000 letters from tranquilliser users .\nAnd then in 1988 , the British Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On 1st March , 1988 at the 28th sitting of Standing Committee A on the \u201c Health and Medicines Bill \u201d at the House of Commons , the Minister , Mrs Edwina Currie , replying to questions

important matters , and I sent them on to the appropriate bodies .\nI do not agree with everything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is good plain common sense .\nI always read his column with the greatest

been taking place with cattle ranchers and the globalists \u2019 plan to take over the meat industry as well.\n\u201d Controlled Demolition of the Protein Supply Is Underway As I explained in yesterday \u2019 s weaponized bird flu article , alleged outbreaks of bird flu and COVID-19 in food animals , along with drought and fertilizer shortages , have led to the mass culling of flocks20 and cattle herds21 around the world .\nSo much so , we \u2019 re now told to expect egg,22 poultry and meat shortages.23 Add to that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of animal feed that can be produced this year , and the curious decision to limit U.S. fertilizer shipments on trains , which restricts distribution and raises the cost of what little remains .\nExperts predict it may take up to three years to replenish global grain stocks,24 and in the meantime , farmers won \u2019 t have a readily available supply to feed their livestock .\nCanada-based Nutrien Ltd. , the world \u2019 s largest fertilizer

them a lump sum of \u00a3100,000 \u2014 all while publicly predicting looming food shortages.26 On top of that , the two largest water reservoirs in California have also fallen to \u201c critically low levels \u201d and wildfires are devastating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S.27 Food production is being blatantly attacked and irrationally restricted on so many fronts , it \u2019 s clearly an intentional demolition of primary protein sources28 \u2014 meat , egg and dairy .\nThe Emperor Has No Clothes In a blatantly self-serving gesture , Gates has publicly called for the West to quit eating beef and transition to lab-grown meats , ostensibly to address climate change .\nHe \u2019 s also railed against legislative attempts to make sure fake meats are properly labeled , since labeling would slow

Event , Warning Mass Hunger Looms Following are UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres \u2019 remarks to the Global Food Security Call to Action ministerial meeting , in New York today : Two weeks ago , I visited the Sahel region of Africa , where I met families who do not know where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Severe acute malnutrition \u2014 a wasting disease that can kill if left untreated \u2014 is rising .\nFarm animals are already dying of hunger .\nLeaders told me that , because of the war in Ukraine , on top of the other crises they face , they fear this dangerous situation could tip into catastrophe .\nThey are not alone .\nGlobal hunger levels are at a new high .\nIn just two years , the number of severely food-insecure people has doubled , from 135 million pre-pandemic to 276 million today .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in famine conditions \u2014 an increase of more than 500 per cent since 2016 .\nAs we will discuss in the Security Council tomorrow , these frightening figures are inextricably linked with conflict , as both cause and effect .\nIf we do not feed people , we feed conflict .\nThe climate emergency is another driver of global hunger .\nOver the past decade , 1.7 billion people have been affected by extreme weather and climate\u2011related disasters .\nThe economic shock caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has compounded food insecurity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An uneven recovery from the pandemic has already put many developing countries on the brink of debt default and restricted access to financial markets .\nAnd now the Russian invasion in Ukraine is amplifying and accelerating all these factors \u2014 climate change , COVID-19 and inequality .\nIt threatens to tip tens of millions of people over the edge into food insecurity , followed by malnutrition , mass hunger and famine , in a crisis that could last for years .\nBetween them , Ukraine and Russia produce almost a third of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of its sunflower oil .\nRussia and Belarus are the world \u2019 s number two and three producers of potash , a key ingredient of fertilizer .\nIn the past year , global food prices have risen by nearly one third , fertilizer by more than half , and oil prices by almost two thirds .\nMost developing countries lack the fiscal space to cushion the blow of these huge increases .\nMany can not borrow because markets are closed to them .\nThose that are able to borrow are charged high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of debt distress and default .\nIf high fertilizer prices continue , today \u2019 s crisis in grain and cooking oil could affect many other foods , including rice , impacting billions of people in Asia and the Americas .\nHigh rates of hunger have a devastating impact on individuals , families and societies .\nChildren may suffer the lifetime effects of stunting .\nMillions of women and children will become malnourished ; girls will be pulled from school and forced to work or get married ; and families will embark on dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nEnding hunger is within our reach .\nThere is enough food in our world now for everyone , if we act together .\nBut , unless we solve this problem today , we face the spectre of global food shortages in the coming months .\nI see five urgent steps for Governments , international financial institutions and others , to solve the short-term crisis and prevent long-term catastrophe .\nFirst , we must urgently reduce the pressure on markets by increasing supplies of food and fertilizers .\nThere should be no restrictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made available to those most in need .\nBut , let \u2019 s be clear : there is no effective solution to the food crisis without reintegrating Ukraine \u2019 s food production , as well as the food and fertilizer produced by Russia and Belarus , into world markets \u2014 despite the war .\nRussia must permit the safe and secure export of grain stored in Ukrainian ports .\nAlternative transportation routes can be explored \u2014 even if we know that by itself , they will not be enough to solve the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrestricted access to world markets without indirect impediments .\nI have been in intense contact on this issue with the Russian Federation , Ukraine , Turkey , United States , European Union and several other key countries .\nI am hopeful , but there is still a long way to go .\nThe complex security , economic and financial implications require goodwill on all sides for a package deal to be reached .\nI will not go into details because public statements could undermine the chances of success .\nSecond , social protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the right combinations of food , cash and support for water , sanitation , nutrition , and livelihoods .\nWhich in turn means , third : finance is essential .\nDeveloping countries must have access to liquidity so that they can provide social protection to everyone in need .\nInternational financial institutions need to step in with generous investments to prevent a global debt crisis .\nThere is no answer to the food crisis without an answer to the finance crisis .\nOfficial development assistance ( ODA ) is more necessary than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not an option while the world is on the brink of mass hunger .\nFourth , Governments must bolster agricultural production and invest in resilient food systems that protect smallholder food producers .\nAt today \u2019 s prices , farmers can not afford seeds , fuel and fertilizers .\nGovernments must be able to support them with subsidies and connect them to markets .\nFifth , humanitarian operations must be fully funded to prevent famine and reduce hunger .\nHumanitarian organizations have a proven track record of preventing famine , most recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they need resources .\nAnd those resources must be used for maximum good , by exempting humanitarian food purchases from taxes , sanctions and other restrictions .\nWe are closely monitoring the global food security outlook and using our convening power to push for immediate steps .\nThe Global Crisis Response Group on food , energy and finance is tackling the impact of the crisis on vulnerable people , identifying and pushing for solutions .\nThe food crisis has no respect for borders , and no country can overcome it alone .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ people out of hunger is to act together , urgently and with solidarity .", "author": "NEWS WIRE", "url": "https://21stcenturywire.com/2022/05/19/un-secretary-general-russian-food-fertilizers-must-have-unrestricted-access-to-world-markets/", "published": "Thu,

western governments and media are running with what Bill Gates foreshadowed as \u2018 the next pandemic \u2019 .\nThis latest \u2018 zoonotic \u2019 sensation appears be the obscure and exotic monkeypox virus , which has already grabbed the headlines , as members of the embryonic global government confab , the G7 , are already throwing hundreds of millions in public money at Big Pharma supposedly to \u2018 stop the spread.\n\u2019 D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu , anyone ?\nOver in the UK , Health Secretary Sajid Javid has announced that the government will be stocking up on smallpox vaccines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of monkeypox .\nThis , despite the fact that to date , there \u2019 s still no substantial science which proves or even remotely indicates that such a one-size-fits-all vaccine will do anything to stop the spread of the alleged virus .\nJavid claims that another 11 supposed \u2018 cases \u2019 of monkeypox have now been \u2018 confirmed \u2019 in the UK .\nHowever , no real evidence has been presented which definitively shows that any of these people are infected and sick due to a specific monkeypox virus derived from a patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealing a full virus present in nature .\nTo date , the government has not shown they are in possession of such evidence .\nSo on which basis are these monkeypox diagnoses being made ?\nBy symptoms , and a PCR test ?\nIf so , how long ago was this PCR testing protocol developed , and was it ever peer reviewed ?\nThis is all beside the fact that the PCR test is not a legitimate diagnostic test .\nOf course , there is no way anyone could possibly make such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deadliness \u2019 of this , or any other spontaneous exotic pathogen being touted by \u2018 public health \u2019 officials or mainstream media outlets .\nHere we are witnessing the exact same fraud perpetrated by \u2018 public health \u2019 officials and so-called experts when the Covid pandemic campaign was launched in winter of 2020 when their emergency response and policy prescriptions were driven by fear and hype , and based on guesswork and creative data modeling .\nWe should know by now that such a wild , reactionary approach is a recipe for disaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem ready to repeat their past failures again .\nAnd just like that , with a flip of the \u2018 global pandemic \u2019 switch , large tranches of public money are once again flowing freely into the pockets of the transnational pharmaceutical cartel , along with the various bio surveillance testing , technologies , PPE , and digital app rackets\u2026 The U.S. government has ordered millions of doses of a vaccine that protects against monkeypox .\nThe news follows the first confirmed case in the states\u2014a man in Massachusetts\u2014following an outbreak in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 119 million order for Jynneos vaccines , which are used for the prevention of both smallpox and monkeypox .\nIt was announced by biotechnology company Bavarian Nordic , which makes the vaccine , on Wednesday .\nThe order will convert bulk vaccines , which have already been made and invoiced under previous contracts with the U.S. government , into freeze-dried versions which have an improved shelf-life .\nThe total government contract with Bavarian Nordic amounts to $ 299 million [ share prices have surged following the announcement of a new prospective pandemic @ @

"content": "Acting on an initiative from the Biden Administration , by November 2022 , conveniently at the onset of the next flu season in the northern hemisphere , the World Health Organization , barring a miracle , will impose an unprecedented top-down control over the national health regulations and measures of the entire planet .\nIn what amounts to a stealth coup d \u2019 etat , WHO will get draconian new powers to override national sovereignty in 194 UN member countries , and to dictate their health measures with force of international law .\nIt is sometimes referred to as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more .\nWorse , most of the WHO budget comes from private vaccine-tied foundations like the Gates Foundation or from Big Pharma , a massive conflict of interest .\nDoing something with stealth means doing it in a secretive or concealed manner , to prevent it being widely known and possibly opposed .\nThis applies to the proposal given by the Biden Administration to the Geneva WHO in January 18 , 2022 according to official WHO documents .\nThe WHO hid the details of the US \u201c amendments \u201d for almost three months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month before the relevant body of the WHO meets to approve the radical measures .\nMoreover , rather than the previous 18 month waiting time to become treaty in international law , only 6 months are used this time .\nThis is a bum \u2019 s rush .\nThe US proposal is backed by every EU country and in total 47 countries ensuring almost certain passage .\nThe proposals , officially titled , \u201c Strengthening WHO preparedness for and response to health emergencies : Proposal for amendments to the International Health Regulations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Global Affairs ( OGA ) in the US Department of Health and Human Services , Loyce Pace , as \u201c amendments \u201d to a previously ratified 2005 WHO International Health Regulations treaty .\nThe WHO defines that 2005 treaty thus : \u201c the International Health Regulations ( 2005 ) ( IHR ) provide an overarching legal framework that defines countries \u2019 rights and obligations in handling public health events and emergencies that have the potential to cross borders .\nThe IHR are an instrument of international law that is legally-binding on 196 countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d ( emphasis added ) .\nMs Pace came to the Biden Administration from heading the Global Health Council , whose members include the most corrupt names in Big Pharma including Pfizer , Lilly , Merck , J & J , Abbott , Bill Gates-funded AVAC , to name a few .\nHer proposals for the radical transformation of WHO \u201c pandemic \u201d and epidemic powers , could easily have been written by Gates and Big Pharma .\nBefore we look at what the Loyce Pace \u201c amendments \u201d will do to empower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health dictatorship with unprecedented powers to overrule judgments of any national governments , one stealthy legal issue must be noted .\nBy disguising a complete change in the 2005 WHO treaty powers as mere \u201c amendments \u201d to a ratified treaty , WHO claims , along with the Biden Administration , that the approval of the amendments requires no new ratification debate by member governments .\nThis is stealth .\nWith no national debate by elected representatives , the unelected WHO will become a global superpower over life and death in the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process of public participation to ram this through .\nAs required , the WHO finally published the US \u201c amendments.\n\u201d It shows the deletions and as well the new additions .\nWhat the Biden Administration changes do is to transform a previously advisory role for the WHO to national governments on not only pandemic responses but also everything tied to national \u201c health , \u201d with an entirely new power to override national health agencies if the WHO Director General , now Tedros Adhanom , determines .\nThe US Biden Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely new treaty which will shift all health decisions from a national or local level to Geneva , Switzerland and WHO .\nTypical of the Washington amendments to the existing WHO Treaty is Article 9 .\nThe US change is to insert WHO \u201c shall \u201d and delete \u201c may \u201d : \u201c If the State Party does not accept the offer of collaboration within 48 hours , WHO shall may\u2026 , .\nIn the same article now deleted is \u201c offer of collaboration by WHO , taking into account the views of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or judgment of say , Germany or India , or USA health authorities become irrelevant .\nWHO will be able to override national experts and dictate as international law its mandates for any and all future pandemics as well as even epidemics or even local health issues .\nMoreover in the new proposed Article 12 on \u201c Determination of a public health emergency of international concern , public health emergency of regional concern , or intermediate health alert , \u201d WHO head\u2013now Tedros in his new 5-year term\u2013alone can decide to declare an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member state .\nThe WHO head will then consult his relevant WHO \u201c Emergency Committee \u201d on Polio , Ebola , Bird Flu , COVID or whatever they declare to be a problem .\nIn short this is a global dictatorship over citizen health by one of the most corrupt health bodies in the world .\nThe members of a given WHO Emergency Committee are chosen under opaque procedures and typically , as in the current one on polio , many members are tied to the various Gates Foundation fronts like GAVI or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely opaque and internal to WHO .\nAmong other powers the new Pandemic Treaty will give Tedros and WHO the power to mandate vaccine passports and COVID jabs worldwide .\nThey are working on the creation of a global vaccine passport/digital identity program .\nUnder the new \u201c Pandemic Treaty \u201d , when people are harmed by the WHO \u2019 s health policies , there \u2019 s no accountability .\nThe WHO has diplomatic immunity .\nFormer WHO senior employee and whistleblower , Astrid Stuckelberger , now a scientist at the Institute of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the University of Geneva , noted , \u201c if the new Pandemic Treaty is adopted by member states , \u201c this means that the WHO \u2019 s Constitution ( as per Article 9 ) will take precedence over each country \u2019 s constitution during natural disasters or pandemics .\nIn other words , the WHO will be dictating to other countries , no longer making recommendations.\n\u201d Who is WHO ?\nThe Director General of WHO would have the ultimate power under the new rules , to determine for example if say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impose a Shanghai-style pandemic lockdown or any other measures it decides .\nThis is not good .\nEspecially when the head of WHO , Tedros , from the Tigray region of Ethiopia , is a former member of the Politburo of the designated terrorist ( then by Washington ) Marxist organization , the Tigray People \u2019 s Liberation Front .\nHe holds no medical degree , the first in WHO director-general history without such .\nHe has a PhD in Community Health , definitely a vague field , hardly medical qualification for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific papers are titles such as \u201c The effects of dams on malaria transmission in Tigray Region.\n\u201d He reportedly got his WHO job in 2017 via backing from Bill Gates , the largest private donor to WHO .\nAs Ethiopia Minister of Health in the Tigray-led dictatorship , Tedros was involved in a scandalous coverup of three major cholera outbreaks in the country in 2006 , 2009 and 2011 .\nAn investigative report published by the Society for Disaster Medicine and Public Health found that during one major cholera outbreak , \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause of the acute watery diarrhea ( AWD ) , the Government of Ethiopia ( Tedros ) decided not to declare a \u201c cholera outbreak \u201d for fear of economic repercussions resulting from trade embargos and decreased tourism .\nFurther , the government , in disregard of International Health Regulations ( WHO ) , continually refused to declare a cholera epidemic and largely declined international assistance.\n\u201d As Ethiopian Health and later Foreign Minister Tedros was accused of systematic ethnic cleansing against rival tribes in the country , especially Amharas , denying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid , as well as nepotism , diversion of international funds for hospital construction into political support for his minority party .\nIronically this is the opposite of the new WHO law Tedros backs today .\nOn 22 September 2021 Merkel \u2019 s Germany proposed Tedros for a further term without opposition .\nA hint of what \u2019 s in store under the new rules was given by WHO \u2019 s largest donor ( including his GAVI ) , the self-appointed \u201c Globalist Everything Czar \u201d , Bill Gates .\nOn his April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amusingly with the acronym GERM \u2014 Global Epidemic Response and Mobilization\u2014team .\nIt would have a \u201c permanent organization of experts who are fully paid and prepared to mount a coordinated response to a dangerous outbreak at any time.\n\u201d He says his model is the Hollywood movie , Outbreak .\n\u201c The team \u2019 s disease monitoring experts would look for potential outbreaks .\nOnce it spots one , GERM should have the ability to declare an outbreak\u2026 \u201d It would be coordinated by , of course , Tedros \u2019 WHO : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the WHO , the only group that can give it global credibility.\n\u201d A dystopian notion of what could take place is the ongoing fake \u201c Avian Flu \u201d epidemic , H5N1 , that is causing tens of millions of chickens to be terminated worldwide if even one chick tests positive for the disease .\nThe test is the same fraudulent PCR test used to detect COVID-19 .\nRecently , Dr Robert Redfield , Trump \u2019 s head of CDC , gave an interview where he \u201c predicted \u201d that Bird Flu will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the coming \u201c Great Pandemic , \u201d for which COVID-19 was a mere warm-up .\nRedfield declared in a March 2022 interview , \u201c I think we have to recognize \u2013 I \u2019 ve always said that I think the COVID pandemic was a wakeup call .\nI don \u2019 t believe it \u2019 s the great pandemic .\nI believe the great pandemic is still in the future , and that \u2019 s going to be a bird flu pandemic for man .\nIt \u2019 s gon na have significant mortality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s gon na be trouble.\n\u201d Under the new WHO dictatorial powers , WHO could declare a health emergency on such a fraud regardless of contrary evidence .\nF.

wives and a libel case .\nI wonder how many staff at the BBC have heard of Nero fiddling while Rome burnt .\nSEE ALSO : WHO Pandemic Treaty : \u2018 A Stealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gates , Big Pharma \u2019 The latest threat we have to face comes from the World Health Organisation which , as I reported weeks ago , threatens the sovereignty and democracy of every nation .\nGovernments everywhere are handing over power to the World Health Assembly , which is about to become the proof that the conspirators are planning a World Government .\nOur new ruler will be the secretary general of the WHO ( \u2018 advised \u2019 , no doubt , by Bill Gates ) .\nThe mainstream media has pretty well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important news stories for decades .\nThis story is infinitely more important and more threatening than the Russian invasion of Ukraine .\nBut we have a champion .\nDr Zac Cox BDS , of the World Doctors \u2019 Alliance , has authorised a legal letter asking for a judicial review of the British Government \u2019 s plan to hand over power to the WHO .\nYou can see Dr Cox \u2019 s letter below .\nPlease read it : Prime Minister The Secretary of State for Health and Social Care Care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 102 Petty France London SW1H 9GL Request for an Urgent Review regarding forthcoming WHA agenda item I am writing on behalf of Dr. R. Zac Cox BDS regarding serious concerns arising from the current proposal for an agenda item on the 75th World Health Assembly ( WHA ) namely the proposed amendments to the International Health Regulations 2005 ( IHR ) .\nProposed agenda item 16.2 ( 12th April 2022 ) .\n75th WHA Agenda Item It is understood that at the 75th WHA , due to commence on 22nd May 2022 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by America and these are sponsored by the UK ( along with 19 other Member States ( MSs ) ) .\nIt is further understood that such amendments will be subject to a vote by MS delegates and almost certainly adopted by each MS in accordance with the IHR and World Health Organisation ( WHO ) constitution ( thereafter being adopted into National legislation in accordance with IHR ) .\nConsequences of WHA agenda item A direct consequence of the delegation to the WHA delegate at the 75th WHA is to allow adoption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not absolute , decision-making authority to WHO Director General ( DG ) as to decisions for regional and intermediate lockdown measures ( which currently only relate to advice for international situations ) .\nAs set out below , the harms that can result from such lockdowns are not only far-reaching but substantial in terms of financial damage to the country as well as individuals .\nA large body of experts now consider that lockdown measures are harmful and neither \u201c safe nor effective \u201d all arguments to the contrary notwithstanding .\nConstitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights protected by the ECHR are clearly of relevance .\nFurthermore , issues of constitutional change are clearly of the utmost importance and one must do all to ensure that justice is not just done but is seen to be done and that fundamental natural law rights and freedoms are not breached or curtailed/infringed .\nProportionality and greater justification of reasons for delegation and use of discretion are clearly essential where constitutional and human rights issues are concerned .\nUse of discretion and delegation of powers must be as Parliament intended .\nLack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers of WHO , the DG of WHO , IHR , WHA , delegation of voting powers at WHA , the American proposed amendments to IHR , sponsorship by UK of these proposed amendments and the far-reaching nature of these ( in the context of Human Rights to a WHO delegate ) is negligible if not completely absent .\nPublic awareness and calls for action to oppose the \u201c Pandemic Treaty \u201d due to concerns of loss of sovereignty to WHO have begun ( see for example https : //petition.parliament.uk/petitions/614335 \u2013 The WHO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pandemic prevention , preparedness and response .\nWe believe the public must be furnished with the full ramifications of what and how any pandemic treaty could affect them , and be given a public vote on whether the UK should sign up , before the UK Government signs up to this ) when the commencement date is in fact not until 2024 but the proposed amendments to the IHR are not within general public knowledge despite the imminent WHA this month in May 2022 and the likely adoption of the proposed amendments at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far reaching outcome than the Pandemic Treaty .\nUrgent request for review This letter should be considered as a request for an immediate/urgent review to the decision not to publicise , obtain parliamentary scrutiny and or public consultation of the agenda item before it \u2019 s adoption/discussion at the 75th WHA starting on 22nd May 2022 .\nSuch review to be made with reference to the material and information contained in this letter and/or an indication that knowledge of this government decision to delegate consideration of amendments to IHR is deemed appropriate when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendments if adopted ( without public awareness of the significance , without parliamentary scrutiny and without public consultation ) .\nIn light of the high-profile Brexit decisions and related government claim of maintaining sovereignty , such delegation of powers to DG of WHO ( and delegation of such decision-making for amendments to a WHA delegates ) giving powers with far-reaching consequences by way of amending international regulations seems to be incompatible and potentially inadvertent/unwitting oxymoron .\nThe lawfulness of the proposed amendments to IHR appears to be questionable and the delegation of adopting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far reaching potential constitutional effect and the lack of public awareness and/or parliamentary scrutiny ) .\nBy way of an example of the effect of adoption of the proposed amendments : DG can listen to another Member State ( MS ) to give information ( not requiring evidence ) no matter their motive which could cause harm ( financial ) to UK , DG acts on this information , recommends lockdown in UK causing financial harm in UK and HR issues to UK nationals ( incompatible with \u201c the Convention Rights \u2019 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Article 2 : Right to education ) .\nPlease consider , therefore , a review of UK sponsorship and inclusion as an agenda issue in light of the following : - \u2022 amendments were sponsored without public awareness and without public scrutiny or public consultation \u2022 constitutional amendment regarding delegation of potential sovereign rights to an unelected body in the context of it ( i ) being unknown ( ii ) IHR scope being unknown ( iii ) proposed IHR amendments being unknown ( iv ) UK sponsorship of proposed amendments being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers being unknown ( vi ) delegate voting at WHA on UK behalf unknown .\n\u2022 Whether a failure to now review sponsorship of such a constitutional matter is either ultra vires and or Wednesbury unreasonable especially given the delegation aspect and the complete lack of transparency of the regulations , amendments and delegation of decision-making as well as the resulting delegation of power and therefore sovereignty .\n\u2022 Whether it is an abuse of , or unlawful use of , or improper purpose of use of discretion- i.e .\nimproper delegation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is unknown if relevant considerations have been applied and irrelevant ones discounted and or what the real purpose the discretion was used for ( especially in light of the complete lack of transparency and potential dangerousness of delegation of sovereign powers hidden within wording of discrete secondary legislation ) .\n\u2022 Whether there are concerns of irrationality- namely the decision to sponsor and delegate such a decision to WHA \u2013 namely is it Wednesbury unreasonable given the far-reaching nature .\nThe principle of proportionality being applicable given the human rights and constitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedural impropriety- namely failure to comply with ( i ) constitutional procedures ( ii ) legitimate expectations re constitutional/ sovereignty issues re delegated decision on regional and intermediate lockdowns etc to Director-General ( DG ) of WHO ( iii ) general duty to act fairly \u2013 natural justice and justice being seen to be done .\n\u2022 Whether such amendments with far-reaching consequences should be subject to public consultation and parliamentary scrutiny .\n\u2022 Whether it is appropriate to remove the proposed amendments from being a WHA agenda item at 75th WHA May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be deemed an organisation suitable to be given sovereign powers by virtue of the proposed amendments ( especially in view of the controversial private funded nature of the organisation since 2005 including Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation ( a larger contribution than even the United States government ) and also include donors who profit from lockdown measure such as AstraZeneca , Bayer , Pfizer , Johnson & Johnson , and Merck. )\n.\n\u2022 Name and contact details for the 75th WHA UK delegate .\n\u2022 Date of any Parliamentary debates relating to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any publication with explanations to the general public of UK regarding the proposed amendments \u2022 Any information/ debate details regarding proposed national legislation to incorporate the proposed amendments should they be adopted at 75th WHA .\n\u2022 Date and reasons for sponsorship by UK of the proposed amendments with details of considerations of transparency and public awareness of proposed delegated powers and their effect .\n\u2022 My Client relies on information regarding the 75th WHA that is researchable following the announcement of the proposed \u201c pandemic Treaty \u201d ( Pandemic prevention , @ @ @ @ @

and such like are still arguable \u2022 Information and or advice regarding the effectiveness of the covid-19 vaccines and other lockdown measures in reducing transmission .\nMy Client is informed by the latest available data and analysis on lockdown measures .\n\u2022 In the recent report/review published by John Hopkins Institute for Applied Economics , Global Health , and Study of Business Enterprise , Jonas Herby , Lars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an analysis of each of these three groups support the conclusion that lockdowns have had little to no effect on COVID-19 mortality .\nMore specifically , stringency index studies find that lockdowns in Europe and the United States only reduced COVID-19 mortality by 0.2 % on average .\nIt would be helpful to understand government \u2019 s position so that action can be considered within the tight Judicial Review timescales and given the pending 75th WHA due to start on 22nd May 2022 , and you are therefore asked to provide written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday 13th May 2022 : \u2022 The fact that a review with the above information has been carried out and the outcome and reasons and/or reasons for failure to review ; \u2022 The name and contact details for the UK delegate for the 75th WHA 2022 expected to deal with the proposed amendments to the IHR together with a list of delegates for the other 193 MS ; \u2022 Answers to requests for information ( 1 ) \u2013 ( 6 ) inc. above .\nShould a satisfactory response not be received , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 5pm 13th May 2022 , it is anticipated that one or more of the following actions ( but not limited to the same ) will be taken ( whether by an individual application or proposed group standing action ) in seeking to protect fundamental constitutional rights : \u2022 Pre-action protocol JR letter before claim ( if timing allows ) ; \u2022 Emergency JR application seeking an injunction prohibiting the proposed amendments to remain on the 75th WHA Agenda ; and/or prohibiting UK Sponsorship to continue pre transparency eg parliamentary scrutiny and public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaration : ultra vires and or Wednesbury unreasonable and or procedurally improper ; \u2022 JR request for a mandatory order that such far reaching amendments have to be subject to transparency , public consultation and parliamentary scrutiny/ order prohibiting inclusion of the proposed amendments on the WHA agenda .\nYou will appreciate that time is of the essence in this matter and as such we look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible and within 7 days at the latest ( 5pm 13th May 2022 ) .\nPlease note that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he considers it to be an urgent matter of the utmost public importance .\nDr Cox \u2019 s letter is one of the most important documents since Magna Carta .\nIt is vital for our future that the Government is forced to reply .\nThere have been a good many pointless legal challenges in the last two years .\nBut this one is crucial .\nIf governments have their way we will soon be slaves \u2013 forced , without the option , to follow orders from the dangerous people at the World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last two years , appeared to follow instructions from the

.\nThe Yemini people rose in a popular revolution against a corrupt regime that acted in the interests of regional and international power blocks and not in the interests of its people .\nThe people of Ukraine found themselves the victim of a regime change operation in 2014 resulting in a coup that forced the democratically elected leader Viktor Fedorovych Yanukovych to flee for his life as a

\u2019 s Republic , making my way to an interview in Moscow , when I saw a May 11 CNN story claiming Russia had targeted civilians in the Ukrainian city of Odessa .\nThis was after the bombing of a hotel and shopping center there .\nWhen such structures are bombed , one assumes that they were filled with civilians .\nOdessa was also the location of a massacre that took place after the 2014 coup

anti-fascists .\nMy friend and guide during the Lugansk portion of my trip was Alexey Albu , who was inside that burning building and one of the few who escaped .\nAt the time , Alexey was an elected member of the Odessa Regional Council .\nHe was a former member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine and at that time the local coordinator of Union Borotba ( Struggle ) .\nBurning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2014 ( Source : theguardian.com ) He and others were working on solving the contradictions created in society by the coup in a peaceful way through the still-existing

against any opposition .\nPolitical repression and jailings were on the rise by the coup government , and six days after the massacre , Alexey found out he was to be arrested .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crimea where they felt safe .\nHe later went to Lugansk to continue his political work , but had to separate from his family for four years to do so .\nAs he is from Odessa and still has many connections there , I wanted to ask Alexey about the bombing on May 11 .\nAlexey responded : \u201c Yes , Russia attacked the luxury hotel Grande Pettine , because there were foreign mercenaries operating there .\nAnd the big shopping and entertainment center Riviera was attacked because they turned it into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s also important to know that Russia used high-precision missiles , so as not to cause harm to civilians .\nAnd it is very interesting that CNN did not pay attention when more than 40 civilians were drowned in blood and burned in fire in the Trade Unions Building on the second

in order to be as truthful as possible , since they were still working as advisers .\nThe article challenged the official narrative that Russian President Putin was targeting civilians .\nRegarding a similar earlier accusation by the corporate media about a Russian bombing , said to have targeted \u201c peacekeeping facilities \u201d ( as if belonging to the UN ) , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so-called peacekeeper training ground [ in Yavoriv ] was hit because it was the place where the \u2018 international legion \u2019 [ Ukrainian military unit , training international mercenaries ] was to have

Monkeypox Mythology", "content": "\u201c Monkeypox \u201d \u2013 who could have seen it coming ?\nWell , apparently the organisation founded by Ted Turner in 2001 called the \u2018 Nuclear Threat Initiative \u2019 ( NTI ) saw it coming when they published a report in November 2021 called , \u201c Strengthening Global Systems to Prevent and Respond to High-Consequence Biological Threats.\n\u201d The report states that in March 2021 , they partnered with the Munich Security Conference to run an exercise scenario involving a \u201c deadly , global pandemic involving an unusual strain of monkeypox virus that emerged in the fictional nation of Brinia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pandemic resulted in more than three billion cases and 270 million fatalities worldwide.\n\u201d IMAGE : The Nuclear Threat Initiative introduces Plandemic 2.0 ?\nThis time it is even bigger and monkeypox takes centre stage .\nAmazingly , the scenario had the monkeypox outbreak emerging as a result of an act of bioterrorism in May 2022 , right where we are now .\nWe have dealt with gain of function garbage involving non-existent viruses in several other videos , while Dr Stefan Lanka has also dismantled such fallacies .\nRegardless , the NTI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required in a fantasy outbreak is , \u201c aggressive measures to slow virus transmission by shutting down mass gatherings , imposing social-distancing measures , and implementing mask mandates \u201d .\nThe winning countries , in their hallucination implemented , \u201c large-scale testing and contact-tracing operations and scaled-up their health care systems.\n\u201d Their charts , which seem to be produced by Neil Ferguson \u2019 s calculator , show that countries that don \u2019 t comply with their restrictions and medical interventions will be far worse off .\nThe report goes on to state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the COVID-19 response demonstrate that early actions by national governments have significant , positive impacts in managing the impact of the disease \u201d .\nWhen they say \u201c positive impacts \u201d it is not quite clear who is on the receiving end , although they note that \u201c the COVID vaccine market will exceed $ 150 billion in 2021.\n\u201d All in all the NTI \u2019 s report reads like Event 201 on Ritalin ( Event 201 took place on 18 October , 2019 .\nIt was an exercise involving a \u201c coronavirus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c pandemic \u201d was declared ) .\nAs with COVID-19 it appears that other parties have also been eagerly awaiting a market such a \u201c pandemic \u201d would present .\nLikewise , these fortune-tellers were preparing vaccines to go where no vaccine had gone before .\nIn this case the biotech company Bavarian Nordic gained approval from the FDA in 2019 to market JYNNEOS , a smallpox and monkeypox vaccine .\nOther health authorities were also primed to react to a previously rare condition that has been of no concern for their nations\u2026until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May 20 , 2022 , the UK Health Security Agency published a document titled , \u201c Recommendations for the use of pre and post exposure vaccination during a monkeypox incident \u201d .\nLike COVID-19 , it \u2019 s starting to feel like all roads lead to vaccines again\u2026 APPROVED : Just a matter of time before the \u201c rare \u201d monkeypox vaccine comes to your neighbourhood .\nSo now that the scene has been set we can get into the \u201c science \u201d of monkeypox starting with an official description of the alleged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201c Monkeypox was first discovered in 1958 when two outbreaks of a pox-like disease occurred in colonies of monkeys kept for research , hence the name \u2018 monkeypox.\n\u2019 The first human case of monkeypox was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\u201d They go on to state that , \u201c in humans , the symptoms of monkeypox are similar to but milder than the symptoms of smallpox.\n\u201d The illness is said to be flu-like with the addition of lymph node swelling and then development of a rash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ macules to vesicles to scabs .\nIn terms of the lethality of monkeypox , the CDC state that , \u201c in Africa , monkeypox has been shown to cause death in as many as 1 in 10 persons who contract the disease.\n\u201d This 10 % fatality rate has already stoked the fear narrative and was also used as the case fatality rate in the NTI \u2019 s monkeypox pipe dream .\nIt should be noted that historically monkeypox has been virtually unheard of in first world countries and the rare cases are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Africa .\nIndeed , one of the only recorded \u201c outbreaks \u201d of monkeypox in the first world was in the United States in April 2003 .\nCases were declared in 6 states and said to be caused by rodents that were imported to Texas from Ghana .\nThis was the first time monkeypox had been reported outside of Africa and the CDC published a paper in 2006 analysing the incident .\nThe paper states that , \u201c person-to-person spread of the virus is thought to occur principally via infectious oropharyngeal exudates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has never been scientifically established .\nThey continue to say that , \u201c the virus is thought to have been transmitted from African animals \u201d \u2013 in other words , it \u2019 s another species-jumping pathogen tale .\nAFRICAN MONKEYS : Do these poor little fellas really deserve to be scapegoated ?\n( Source : Wikicommons ) They reported that , \u201c individuals who had illness onset within 21 days after exposure to MPXV [ Monkeypox virus ] who experienced fever ( defined as a body temperature greater 37.4\u00b0C ) and vesicular pustular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus orthopox IgM antibodies were classified as having probable cases of infection.\n\u201d Now 37.4\u00b0C is not a fever in our book , it is a normal body temperature and we would suggest 37.6\u00b0C and above qualifies as a fever .\nWe noted in their chart that they were using the classification \u226539.4\u00b0C , but this appears to be an error as in another paper , we \u2019 ll get to soon , it was once again 37.4\u00b0C .\nThe second paper even said the \u201c fever \u201d could be subjective , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criteria and pathologising a normal state .\nAdditionally , the CDC \u2019 s weekly report from the 11th of July 2003 , stated that from a total of 71 cases , only \u201c two patients , both children , had serious clinical illness ; both of these patients have recovered.\n\u201d The remainder had a variety of respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms .\nThe CDC \u2019 s cases were confirmed on the basis of specimens that showed : \u201c monkeypox virus isolation , detection of monkeypox-specific nucleic acid signatures , positive electron-microscopy findings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a look at the electron micrographs presented by the CDC including the image shown below of a skin sample from one of the patients .\nThe caption informs us that the round particles on the right are immature monkeypox virions , while the oval particles on the left are mature viruses .\nHowever , all they have is a static image of dead tissue and no conclusions can be made about the biological role of the imaged particles .\nNone of them have been shown to be replication-competent disease-causing intracellular parasites and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 .\nThe oldest trick in the book : Image some vesicles and call them \u201c viruses \u201d .\nTo see why this is insufficient watch Electron Microscopy and Unidentified \u201c Viral \u201d Objects .\nLooking at the CDC \u2019 s weekly report from 2003 again , it appears that the 35 \u201c laboratory-confirmed cases \u201d all involved polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) \u201c tests \u201d , so we investigated the scientific evidence behind this claim .\nOne of the citations for the development of PCR detection of monkeypox is a 2004 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detection of Orthopoxviruses and Simultaneous Identification of Smallpox Virus \u201d .\nNow a PCR protocol requires them to know the genetic sequences of the alleged monkeypox virus , which takes us to this 2001 paper titled , \u201c Human monkeypox and smallpox viruses : genomic comparison \u201d .\nThe paper claimed to have \u201c isolated \u201d the monkeypox virus in a rhesus monkey kidney cell culture from a scab of a monkeypox patient .\nHere the virologists are up to their old tricks again by asserting that : ( a ) the patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ( b ) it is now in their culture brew .\nThey claimed to have sequenced the \u201c viral genome \u201d by referring to a process described for sequencing an alleged variola virus in 1993 .\nBut when we look at this paper there is no virus demonstrated either , simply an assertion that it was \u201c isolated \u201d from , \u201c the material from a patient from India \u201d in 1967 .\nThey go on to make the claim that , \u201c the virions were purified by differential centrifugation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is no demonstration of what they purified or how they were determined to be virions .\nIn none of these experiments did they perform any controls by seeing what sequences can be detected from other human-derived scabs or similar specimens from unwell individuals .\nThis is where we need to remind the virologists of what a virus is supposed to be \u2013 that is a replication-competent intracellular parasite that infects and causes disease in a host .\nIt is not detecting genetic sequences contained within scabs and claiming that it belongs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CDC \u2019 s paper describing the 2003 \u201c outbreak \u201d , it is unclear how they established they could be diagnosing anyone with monkeypox by using the PCR .\nTheir PCR can only have been calibrated to sequences of unproven provenance .\nAdditionally , it doesn \u2019 t matter what kind of analytical specificity their PCR protocol had , there was no established diagnostic specificity \u2013 in other words it was not a clinically-validated test , an issue that goes beyond whether the \u201c virus \u201d exists or not .\n( From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the qPCR assay detecting the appropriate target sequence rather than other , nonspecific targets also present in a sample .\nDiagnostic specificity is the percentage of individuals without a given condition whom the assay identifies as negative for that condition . )\nThe 47 US cases they ended up describing were all in some sort of contact with imported African prairie dogs and the CDC \u2019 s paper concludes that , \u201c individuals contracted MPXV infections from infected prairie dogs ; no human-to-human transmission was documented , but there were many different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muco-cutaneous exposures , percutaneous and/or inoculation exposures \u201d .\nNow there were some problems with the study design which they admitted to including that , \u201c the analyses were limited by incomplete reporting or recall of information by patients .\nAnd , because of the retrospective nature of the study , we were unable to obtain highly detailed data \u201d .\nHowever , even allowing some wriggle room for them here , the inconsistencies go further still .\nFirstly , no one in the US incident died from the disease which is said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Africa .\nNo doubt , the inconsistent lethality rates will be attributed to different \u201c variants \u201d , but there can \u2019 t be variants of something that doesn \u2019 t exist .\nThere were few images available of the skin lesions that were reported in the 2003 incident but two of the US cases are depicted below and an image from a monkeypox case in Africa is shown for comparison .\nThe reader can make up their own mind , but those skin reactions do not look remotely comparable to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201c the natural reservoir of monkeypox remains unknown .\nHowever , African rodents and non-human primates ( like monkeys ) may harbor the virus and infect people \u201d \u2013 in other words it \u2019 s all rather vague and remains an unproven hypothesis .\nNow , obviously some people became unwell in the US in 2003 but with the viral theory we are supposed to believe that it jumped from some prairie dogs to some humans and the latter became infected with the alleged virus\u2026but then no human could pass it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat \u2013 a virus needs to spread , if it can \u2019 t spread , it \u2019 s dead , and thus it \u2019 s not a virus .\nAnd the historical patterns of alleged monkeypox virus outbreaks make no sense \u2013 why did it pass to these people so easily and yet it can go a decade between alleged \u201c outbreaks \u201d ?\nUnfortunately , the 2003 incident was investigated as though the viral contagion theory had already been established and other explanations were ignored .\nIf people were allegedly getting sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t it be a good idea to check the animals for other toxicities , particularly in their faeces and also for any ticks or parasites ?\nWe did note another reference state that with regards to the US cases , \u201c many of the people had initial and satellite lesions on palms , soles , and extremities \u201d .\nHowever , according to the CDC , monkeypox usually starts on the face so the clinical picture in the US cases was not consistent with cases that are typically described in Africa .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific evidence revealed that with regards to monkeypox : ( a ) there is no evidence of a physical particle that meets the definition of a virus , ( b ) there is no evidence of anything transmitting between humans , and ( c ) there is no way to confirm a diagnosis of monkeypox unless you believe in clinically-unvalidated tests such as the PCR kits that have been produced .\nIn other words , if we see a monkeypox \u201c pandemic \u201d that is used as an excuse to role out more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of another PCR pandemic , not one that has any basis in nature .\nFor those of you wanting to explore more problems with the various monkeypox claims , Mike Stone of ViroLIEgy has written a couple of interesting commentaries .\nThe first article is , \u201c Was Smallpox Really Eradicated ?\n\u201d , which among other things deals with the convenient emergence of monkeypox while smallpox was apparently being eradicated .\nThe second article is , \u201c Did William Heberden Distinguish Chickenpox From Smallpox in 1767 ?\n\u201d This outlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as readily distinguishable from each other as the text books suggest and appear to relate more to the severity of a similar disease process .\nYou can also watch our video , \u201c Chickenpox Parties and Varicella Zoster Virus ?\n\u201d to see why there is no evidence of a virus in that related condition either .\nFrom the perspective of terrain theory it is a fundamental mistake to attribute a person \u2019 s illness to a supposed virus , as the subsequent \u201c treatments \u201d don \u2019 t address the underlying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then they are usually deficient in nutrients and need to restore balance , or they have been exposed to environmental toxins and need to help the body detoxify .\nWars against alleged pathogens that involve treating everyone the same way with civil rights restrictions and vaccines are certainly not about health .\nIt is good to see more people waking up to the COVID-19 fraud so there is hope that a monkeypox scamdemic , if attempted , will bring even more light to the situation .\nAs always , your best health is @ @ @ @ @ @

to be legion .\nA mixture of physical comedy and wit , Killing Granny could only have been created by Phil Zimmerman , who has sharpened his innate zaniness into a sword of truth .\nPhil @ @ @ @ @ @ @

ridiculous and terrifying , but as with the actual Prime Minister , he unleashes all the bluster and guffawing with very little substance .\nVery much in Phil \u2019 s favour is that he is a naturally funny man .\nHis asides to the audience bring some of the biggest laughs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he is human after all .\nNot only does he have the confidence and experience to hold the audience \u2019

over indulgence and general foppery .\nFast-forward 200 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been replaced by an airborne virus \u2013 or so we are told \u2013 and the hedonist Prince by an equally vain and vainglorious national figurehead in Boris Johnson .\nNot that Zimmerman wastes time on the ephemera of \u201c Partygate \u201d , rather he attacks the whole Covid farrago at its weakest points , which are revealed to be legion .\nA mixture of physical comedy and wit , Killing Granny could only have been created by Phil Zimmerman , who has sharpened his innate zaniness into a sword of truth .\nPhil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobile face and has a Harpoesque ability to contort it into all manner of hideous masks ; something he does with alacrity over the course of the show , using exaggeration both for comic effect and to drive home his point .\nHence , his impersonations are caricatures ; modern day versions of the etchings that hang on the Pavilion walls , grotesques in the best seaside tradition .\nThey recall the hideous effigies in the now defunct Louis Tussaud \u2019 s Waxworks on the seafront , but Zimmerman captures the essence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any inanimate statue could ever possibly achieve .\nHis Bill Gates is genuinely disturbing , the nerdiness unveiled as a creepiness which makes it impossible to watch the billionaire drug pusher with the same eyes again .\nBoris Johnson is simultaneously ridiculous and terrifying , but as with the actual Prime Minister , he unleashes all the bluster and guffawing with very little substance .\nVery much in Phil \u2019 s favour is that he is a naturally funny man .\nHis asides to the audience bring some of the biggest laughs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he is human after all .\nNot only does he have the confidence and experience to hold the audience \u2019 s attention for the full hour , but also to take them with him on a journey through the nonsense of the last two years \u2013 before we all forget .\nThe audience is very much part of Phil \u2019 s show , and a willingness to join in the fun helps .\nPhil \u2019 s enthusiasm is infectious , and his message is on point ; nowhere more in evidence than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see Killing Granny advertised anywhere go and see it .\nIt \u2019 ll definitely make you laugh , and you might well learn something too .\nHighly recommended .\nSee Phil Zimmerman in Killing Granny at this year

meaning of jubilee \u2013 a settling of debts ?\nThe United Kingdom is currently subject to a reigning monarch : Elizabeth .\nWe enter her 70th year on the throne this weekend .\nShe has , unlike her forebears , managed to avoid the dagger of the usurper , dodged disease , and has not yet been dissolved by the people .\nAs such , she has become the longest reigning monarch in Britain , and is not far off the world record .\nThis is known as a platinum jubilee .\nAny British person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one \u2019 s head firmly buried in Camber Sands .\nGarlands of Union Jack bunting are dusted off from village hall store cupboards to bedeck villages and hamlets across Britain .\nNaturally , corporations have jumped on board with their opportunist squawking : \u2018 Buy discounted wine this jubilee \u2019 remarks Stephen Fry on the radio , followed by BP the oil giant , proudly declaring its support for the Queen on her triumphant day .\nWhilst in the supermarket , you can buy Royal Jubilee branded Thai Sweet Chilli crisps .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems that we have lost sight of what jubilee actually means .\nThe word Jubilee comes from the ancient Hebrew : \u2018 joh-bel \u2019 meaning a ram \u2019 s horn .\nHowever , the Septuagint , the oldest known translation of the ancient Hebrew Old Testament puts it as \u201c A trumpet blast of liberty \u201d .\nA jubilee was a triumphal celebration because it entailed the cancellation of all debts and often a release of indentured slaves .\nIt was codified in the Old Testament by Hebrew lawmakers .\nWe find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall make the fiftieth year holy , and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants .\nIt shall be a jubilee to you ; and each of you shall return to his own property , and each of you shall return to his family.\n\u201d Every 50 years all debts were to be settled and cancelled .\nPeople who had lost their land to debtors could return to their land .\nIn fact , this was an incredibly vital aspect of feudal society .\nPeasants would often have a smallholding for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetables and food for their family , as well as to sell at the market .\nIf there was a bad crop , some would take out loans against the land , or even give up the land .\nThey could then fall into a debt loop with no ability to grow crops , and get back their land .\nAncient monarchs would often declare a jubilee when there was a threat of a peasants revolt , or when they took the throne to curry favour with their subjects .\nRather than be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hebrew lawmakers codified the jubilee , the debt cancellation , to be every 50 years .\nThis would be a Sabbath year , where even the land was not to be farmed \u2013 think of it as a Jewish Sabbath day but for an entire year .\nIt is decried by some Hebrew scholars that Nebuchadnezzer \u2019 s destruction of Jerusalem and subsequent 70 year imprisonment of the Israelites was handed down by God for failing to keep this Jubilee .\nThe concept of a \u2018 jubilee \u2019 though goes back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only formalised an ancient practice .\nMichael Hudson PhD has dug into the concept in his work , \u2018 The Lost Tradition of Biblical Debt Cancellations \u2019 .\nHe traces debt cancellation as far back as 2400BC when king Enmetena of Sumer \u201c proclaims amargi upon winning region wide suzerainty \u201d .\nHe became king and as a gesture of goodwill perhaps , he declared a jubilee and cancelled the debt as well as declaring \u201c freedom \u201d for many slaves in the nation .\nThis type of act is commonly referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it gives something of a new beginning for people of the society .\nIt would especially be of benefit to the widows , children and poorest amongst society where a small debt could make life difficult and there is no other clear way to escape the debt cycle .\nLet us consider this in modern day terms .\nTaking figures for the UK , which mirror those of many Western nations , we see that the average personal debt is over \u00a333,000 ( US $ 41,000 ) per person .\nThat is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UK owes more than an average annual salary to various creditors , and will accrue interest fees on such debts .\nNot only that but over 10 % of that debt , \u00a33,700 , is held as unsecured debt \u2013 the payday loans and credit cards who ask for no advance deposit and in return charge exorbitant interest rates .\nWe can see from this a picture where the average Brit is actually waist deep in a miasma of debts .\nYes , some can tend these debts with their wages but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle .\nNHS statistics show us that over 100,000 people attempt suicide in the UK each year giving debt as a main reason for doing so .\nMorbid reading I know , but it illustrates the bleeding edge of what may seem like a numbers game to economists on high .\nIt takes only seconds for a debt to be created on a bank \u2019 s computer .\nThey don \u2019 t have to source gold or an asset to back up the debt , not since the 1970 \u2019 s .\nThrough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create a corresponding \u2018 reserve \u2019 .\nThese are generated within central bank computers to the tune of trillions every year .\nIn fact , the system would collapse if they did not continue to do so .\nBut whilst the proverbial fat cat presses enter on a keyboard , the cold statistics of inflation , costs and interest rates belie the human costs to happiness , liberty and of life itself .\nFor most , there is simply no clear route out of these debts .\nCould a debt jubilee be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have taken personal debt as our topic of discussion .\nPersonal debt is more parallel to those debts of yore which the ancients forgave .\nIn ancient Israel , during a Jubilee year , the state would not forgive debts to foreigners , nor would it renege on state debt obligations .\nThis could be applied to the level of modern international finance .\nThe World Economic Forum ( WEF ) , a talking shop for ne \u2019 erdowells , banksters and Malthusians alike , gives us the total for world debt as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 303 with twelve zeroes after it ) .\nThis debt is made up of international debt agreements from one arm of the global banking cartel , the International Monetary Fund , hand in hand with World Bank reserves ; and completing the triumvirate of financial overlords is the Bank of International Settlements , sitting atop the debt pyramid .\nThese trillions are largely comprised of sovereign debts , 10 year bonds , and bond buybacks \u2013 and they are the plaything of technocrats .\nNone of these debts are for farmers buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for mothers buying food for their children , nor even small business owners seeking to expand their shop .\nPersonal debt makes up a minuscule slice of the ever expanding debt pie .\nNow none of us really voted or consented to the creation of these debts , nor were the contracts ratified by swathes of the global population .\nThey were simply drafted , signed and , we imagine , guffawed over whilst sipping brandy , behind closed doors .\nWho owes these trillions and to whom is unclear , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for personal debt to reside within .\nIf we are talking about a jubilee there should be a clear definition between \u2018 real \u2019 debt , those created and paid off by real people \u2013 from the imaginary debt which props up global institutions without true authority .\nThere have been calls for a modern jubilee , and it has not been from one particular ideology .\nBernie Sanders , viewed as economically left-wing in the United States , made a central pillar of his presidential campaign the cancellation of student debts .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young who are pincered by rising costs without the rising wages that their parents \u2019 generation enjoyed .\nAnd on the proverbial right we have the UK publication , MoneyWeek , a financial publication from the belly of the beast in London .\nThey published an article at the announcement of totalitarian lockdown of the citizenry in March 2020 , advocating a debt jubilee in response to the impending economic damage .\nThough aspects of jubilee are brought up in the media , it is variously under-reported and misunderstood .\nAnd as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave a magic wand to eradicate the debt burden , there are some critical counter-points to consider .\nOne is the so-called \u2018 moral hazard \u2019 of deleting debt .\nIt could be the case , and likely would be the case that there would be winners and losers in a jubilee .\nTake on the one hand , the hard-working family who have lived with a tight belt buckle , worked hard at multiple jobs and budgeted : forgoing the extra holidays and luxury purchases and have paid off their personal debts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injustice if a jubilee paid off the debts accrued by a reckless spender who took out many loans , in full knowledge that they could not pay them back .\nWhy should they be treated one and the same ?\nAnd moreover , it would remove the incentive for anybody to pay back debts in the future \u2013 if one now knows they could be cancelled at a later date .\nIt \u2019 s hard to imagine one jubilee without there being calls for Jubilee 2.0 .\nFurthermore , I question the ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , given that the levers of financial power are in the claws of provably malfeasant characters .\nCentral banks who deliberately rob value from the poor through inflation , commercial banks who profit from bleeding out the savers and borrowers below them , and politicians who we know seek self-interest over the interests of their electorate .\nThese all make up the class of people who would be in charge of a jubilee .\nAnd just as in the 2008-2009 financial crisis , it would be they who benefit .\nThey took huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay off their reckless and amoral policies .\nNone of which have been repaid in any meaningful way .\nOver and over again financial institutions ransack poor countries , and leverage the assets of wealthy countries in their charade with nonetheless real world consequences .\nAnd if you think I am speaking too strongly on the financial class I welcome you to show me a high-calibre banker who does not serve their own interest above others , or show me a forward-thinking economist of influence who advocated the elite class losing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Furthermore , if a Great Reset were perpetrated by these known criminals , I believe it would fall into the Central Bank Digital Currency ( CBDC ) schema .\nThat being they could offer the option of debt cancellation , but only at the cost of moving into their purely digital currency model \u2013 you will have no cash outside of their control .\nBeware the banker \u2019 s jubilee .\nThus , as we roll into the Queen \u2019 s Platinum Jubilee weekend , estimated to cost over \u00a31 billion , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning of jubilee : freedom and forgiveness .\nI \u2019 m not asking for you to start an argument over your pint of Pimms .\nNor to alienate that fair weather monarchist in the family who suddenly remembers their love for Queen Lizzie every few years when the newspaper tells them to .\nThe intent is to introduce a potential slip road off the debt motorway to avoid speeding into that smouldering heap of destruction that is on the horizon .\nWe know deep down that the current economic system is unsustainable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is then time to explore heterodox theories to take the place of failed models .\nPerhaps a jubilee of personal debt could help us avoid the alternative : violent revolution , only if we are brave and can shake free the shackles of orthodox , status-quo economics .\nSEE MORE UKRAINE NEWS AT : 21st Century Wire Finance Files

violence and wished painful death upon anyone who didn \u2019 t want to be part of the medical experiment that is the COVID jabs .\nIn an eloquent Medium post , journalist Susan Dunham summarizes the lessons ( hopefully ) learned from hating and attacking the unvaccinated:1 \u201c The mandates have let up , and both sides stumble back into something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except that there is a fresh and present injury done to the people we tried to break .\nAnd no one wants to talk about it .\nOnly weeks ago , it was the admitted goal of our own leaders to make life unlivable for the unvaccinated .\nAnd as a deputized collective , we force-multiplied that pain , taking the fight into our families , friendships , and workplaces .\nToday , we face the hard truth that none of it was justified \u2014 and , in doing that , uncover a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slide from righteousness to cruelty , and however much we might blame our leaders for the push , we \u2019 re accountable for stepping into the trap despite better judgement .\nWe knew that waning immunity put vast numbers of the fully vaccinated on par with the shrinking minority of unvaccinated , yet we marked them for special persecution .\nWe said they hadn \u2019 t \u2018 done the right thing \u2019 by turning their bodies over to state care \u2014 even though we knew that principled opposition to such a thing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was by the willful ignorance of science , civics , and politics that we squeezed the unvaccinated to the degree that we did \u2026 [ W ] e can not hold our heads high , as if believing we had logic , love , or truth on our side while we viciously wished death upon the unvaccinated .\nThe best we can do is sit in the awareness of our rabid inhumanity for having cast so many aside \u2026 [ B ] etting against them has been a scathing embarrassment for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the mandates only had the power we gave them .\nIt was not through quiet compliance that we avoided endless domination by pharmaceutical companies and medical checkpoints at every doorway .\nIt was thanks to the people we tried to tear down \u2026 We took the bait by hating them , but their perseverance bought us the time to see we were wrong .\nIt seems right now like the mandates will return , but this time there \u2019 s hope that more of us will see them for what they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern for our wellbeing.\n\u201d Dunham addresses the situation from the point of those who fell for the hypnotic command to despise anyone \u2014 friends and family included \u2014 who refused to buy the official narrative about the COVID shots .\nMost of you , however , have likely been on the receiving end of those attacks .\nHow are you choosing to address it ?\nWhat have you learned ?\nI suspect many of you are indeed willing to forgive , but few will ever forget those betrayals .\nBut as noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk about what was done .\nEveryone \u2019 s just going along as if it never happened .\nAs if our leaders didn \u2019 t actually call for our deaths .\nAs if our president didn \u2019 t warn us his patience with us was \u201c wearing thin \u201d 2 \u2014 a threat that implied bad things would happen once patience ran dry .\nAs if news anchors like Don Lemon didn \u2019 t actually say we deserved to starve and shouldn \u2019 t be allowed to enter a grocery store.3,4 But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family and friends did reject us as a result .\nRemarkably , even now , with everything we know for sure about the jabs , the war against the unvaccinated continues in many areas , and while compassion is slowly making a comeback , ignorance of the basics still abounds .\nAs noted in a January 21 , 2022 , MSN article:5 \u201c There seems to be a war on the unvaccinated individuals because of the recent spike in COVID-19 cases due to the more transmissible Omicron variant \u2026 Starting last year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country \u2019 s unvaccinated population , as many people wondered why those who got vaccinated should also face the same restrictions as those who opted against it \u2026 I am all for encouraging people to get vaccinated ; I had my jabs and my booster immediately when they became available in my community \u2026 But I wonder : Just how necessary is this war on the unvaccinated ?\nWhat if a person decided to opt-out against the vaccine because they had preexisting medical conditions , simply feared for their life , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government was too busy forcing and scaring people instead of genuinely informing them ?\n\u201d Sadly , the author of that MSN piece seems convinced that if only the reluctant were to be given the science , the data , they would understand why the shots are so necessary , when the reality is that the science and the data have been the basis for our refusal from the start .\nUntil or unless the experimental jab pushers acknowledge reality , we will never be able to see eye to eye .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial incentive is behind some of the vaccine hesitancy:6 This naivet\u00e9 ignores the reality that countless individuals have sacrificed their careers by refusing the jab .\nFor most of us , it was never about a lack of financial incentives .\nIt was about the very real dangers the jabs pose \u2014 dangers that \u201c the powers that be \u201d have yet to fully acknowledge .\nFirst , They Came for the Unvaxxed .\nThey \u2019 ll Come for You Next From the start , I and many others warned that the demonization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war tactic .\nIn an August 2021 Townhall article , Wayne Allyn Root wrote:7 \u201c It \u2019 s time for alarm bells .\nIt \u2019 s time for me to play the part of Paul Revere : \u2018 The communist tyrants and dictators are coming !\n\u2019 \u2026 They \u2019 re coming first for unvaccinated Americans .\nThis is 1938 .\nI \u2019 m a Jew .\nI now understand just a little of what it felt like to be a Jew in 1938 \u2026 the pre-Holocaust \u2026 This is only the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFirst , \u2018 the papers.\n\u2019 Vaccine mandates and vaccine passports are just like 1938 , when the Gestapo demanded papers from every German .\nRepublicans asked for \u2018 papers \u2019 from migrants who had broken into our country \u2026 Republicans asked for \u2018 papers \u2019 once every two years for federal elections , to prove you have a right to vote .\nDemocrats said , \u2018 No , that \u2019 s racism.\n\u2019 Now Democrats want American citizens , not illegal aliens , not criminals , but patriots born in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weren \u2019 t Jews injected with experimental drugs by the depraved Nazi government ?\nWasn \u2019 t that a key part of the Nuremberg trials ?\nThat no government could ever again inject experimental shots into the bodies of unwilling citizens ?\nIsn \u2019 t that a basic human right ?\n\u2026 [ F ] orcibly injecting Americans who don \u2019 t want it .\nThat \u2019 s 1938.\n\u201d Root goes on to detail the fate of Jews during those pre-Holocaust years .\nThey were locked in their homes .\nThey were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deemed \u201c nonessential.\n\u201d They couldn \u2019 t travel .\nThey had to wear a conspicuous yellow star on their clothing so they could be easily identified and targeted for public displays of hatred .\nJewish books were burned \u2014 that was the 1938 version of online censorship and deplatforming .\n\u201c First , they came for the unvaccinated .\nTrust me : Next , they \u2019 re coming for you , \u201d Root said .\nAnd , indeed , in recent weeks , we \u2019 ve seen the stage being set for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gay community is the designated enemy and target .\nSame-sex relations has been identified as the primary source of a global monkeypox outbreak .\nAlmost every article discussing the outbreaks mentions it .\nThat \u2019 s how it begins .\nI \u2019 ll be very surprised if the gay community won \u2019 t be targeted for exclusion , derision and attack in coming weeks and months .\nWill enough people have learned the lesson of humility that Dunham highlights ?\nHave enough cognitively recognized the error of their ways , or will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nOnly time will tell .\nAt the end of February 2021 , Nick Cohen with The Guardian warned that \u201c It is only a matter of time before we turn on the unvaccinated.\n\u201d 8 By the end of April 2021 , USA Today columnist Michael J. Stern was calling for the public shunning of the vaccine hesitant , calling them \u201c petri dishes \u201d of lethal disease,9 and by July of that year , CNN anchor Don Lemon was calling for brutal anything-goes restrictions against the unvaccinated to force them into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indistinguishable from a death sentence .\nWith COVID , it took barely two months for society to go from \u201c we \u2019 re all in this together , \u201d to declaring half the population subhuman .\nLet \u2019 s see how long it takes before the media start calling for the forced segregation of gays to protect us from monkeypox .\nI hope it doesn \u2019 t happen , but judging by the effectiveness of the brainwashing , causing people buying into clearly absurd narratives , the risk is certainly there .\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ columnist Michael Hiltzik \u201c doubled down on the notion , people should mock the unvaccinated who have died from the coronavirus , \u201d Fox News reported.11 Hiltzik told CNN : \u201c So many of them have actually promoted reckless , dangerous policies and\u2026 they took innocent people along with them .\nEvery one of these deaths is a teachable moment and , unfortunately , we haven \u2019 t been learning from the lesson that we should be hearing from them.\n\u201d Clearly , Hiltzik has not yet experienced the moment of clarity described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that \u201c Mocking anti-vaxxers is ghoulish \u2026 but necessary.\n\u201d His LA Times column12 bearing the same headline displays a picture of a smiling Kelly Ernby , wearing a cross around her neck .\nErnby , an Orange County GOP member , died of COVID complications in January 2022 after opposing COVID jab mandates .\n\u201c How should we react to the deaths of the unvaccinated ?\n\u201d Hiltzik wrote.13 \u201c On the one hand , a hallmark of civilized thought is the sense that every life is precious .\nOn the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical advice by refusing a vaccine known to reduce the risk of serious disease from the virus , including the risk to others , and end up in the hospital or the grave can be viewed as receiving their just deserts.\n\u201d His targeting of Ernby , a Republican , and clearly a Christian to boot , smacks of political vengeance as much as it does misplaced moral superiority .\nAccording to Hiltzik , being civil toward the unvaccinated who die erases the harm done to others , and that harm should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the end , he \u2019 s really condemning himself to the fate he wishes on others because , eventually , the truth will become common knowledge and everyone will recognize the fatal harm inflicted by pushing the use of this experimental gene transfer technology .\nMockery probably won \u2019 t be the extent to the punishment dished out once that critical mass awakening happens .\nIn Some , the Hypnotic Trance Is Still Deep Some , like Dunham , recognize the fallacy in their thinking and call for change .\nOthers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply brainwashed by the fearporn , they really can not connect the dots and see that a \u201c vaccine \u201d that doesn \u2019 t prevent infection or spread can never protect others .\nHence , those who get the jab are no more considerate to others than those who don \u2019 t .\nBoth pose the same risk to others .\nAnd , if both pose the same risk , why target one for derision and not the other ?\nIt \u2019 s beyond irrational , but such is the mind of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThey \u2019 re incapacitated in the worst of ways , unable to see reality .\nScottish journalist Andrew Neil is another one seemingly caught in the myopic focus of mass formation .\nIn December 2021 , he riled against Britain \u2019 s \u201c five million vaccine refuseniks , \u201d saying \u201c They put us all at risk of more restrictions.\n\u201d 14 He went on to describe how quick and easy it was to pull out his vaccine passport at a restaurant .\nSeconds , really .\n\u201c A very minor inconvenience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a sense of safety in knowing that all the other diners had proved themselves to be fully vaccinated , or had very recently tested negative , or had contracted the virus and recovered.\n\u201d He felt safe , having undergone this completely useless ritual , despite recognizing that the shot is \u201c not foolproof , \u201d and that \u201c People who have been vaccinated can still contract and pass on the virus.\n\u201d That \u2019 s the power of hypnosis .\nEven when seeing the dots , he couldn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe propaganda and false information we \u2019 ve been bombarded with over the past two and a half years is truly unprecedented .\nNow , barely a day goes by that isn \u2019 t near-identical to the storyline in Orwell \u2019 s dystopian novel , \u201c 1984.\n\u201d One of the latest examples of the media \u2019 s hypocrisy and false narratives is The Associated Press \u2019 \u201c Conspiracy Theorists Flock to Bird Flu , Hatch Lies \u201d article,15 published May 17 , 2022 .\nThe AP specifically targets me , stating:16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conspiracy theories about avian flu all speak to a distrust of authority and institutions , and a suspicion that millions of doctors , scientists , veterinarians , journalists and elected officials around the world can no longer be trusted .\n\u2018 Americans clearly understand that the federal government and major media have lied to them repeatedly , and are completely corrupted by the pharmaceutical companies , \u2019 said Dr. Joseph Mercola , an osteopath whose discredited claims about vaccines , masks and the coronavirus made him a prominent source of COVID-19 misinformation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird flu dates back years A 2009 book for sale on his website , which Mercola uses to sell unproven natural health remedies , is titled \u2018 The Great Bird Flu Hoax.\n\u2019 \u201d The hyperlinked \u201c fact check \u201d provided to prove I \u2019 ve published \u201c discredited claims about vaccines \u201d is a rebuttal to my statement that \u201c People may be more susceptible to serious COVID-19 illness after they have been vaccinated.\n\u201d The fact check claims that \u201c Research has shown that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preventing COVID-19 illness , \u201d and that \u201c Experts say there is \u2018 abundant \u2019 evidence that people who get shots will not become more sick should they later get the virus.\n\u201d First of all , no expert sources are actually referenced , so what \u201c abundant evidence \u201d proves you won \u2019 t be more susceptible to severe infection post-jab is anyone \u2019 s guess .\nSecondly , and more importantly , everyone now knows the shots are nowhere near 95 % effective .\nEven mainstream media and the U.S. Centers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effectiveness was exaggerated and rapidly dwindles .\nTruth May Be Slow , but It Will Win At best , Moderna \u2019 s shot was 94.5 % effective against symptomatic Delta infection FOR TWO WEEKS , before dropping off.17 Pfizer \u2019 s effectiveness against Delta was lower to start and fell more precipitously .\nAgainst Omicron , the Pfizer jab is 65.5 % protective between weeks 2 and 4 after the second dose , and only 8.8 % effective at week 25 .\nModerna \u2019 s shot starts out at 75.1 % at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls off to 14.9 % at week 25 .\nYet the AP has no qualms about referring back to what is now well-recognized misinformation to \u201c prove \u201d that I \u2019 ve been discredited and that they are \u201c correct.\n\u201d In reality , the fact check they link to only proves they \u2019 re using misinformation to combat truth .\nThat \u2019 s bad enough , but these fabrications are then used to brainwash the public into hating the truth-tellers and anyone who so much as points out discrepancies in the narrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we \u2019 re still on it .\nSimilarly , when the facts finally overwhelm authorities who have been spreading unscientific propaganda , the canned response is that \u201c science is evolving and we \u2019 re following the science.\n\u201d In reality , however , they were proven wrong , but they refuse to admit it .\nSo , they \u201c blame \u201d it on \u201c evolving science , \u201d without ever explaining how \u201c misinformation spreaders \u201d had these supposedly brand-new data months \u2014 or years \u2014 ago .\nWhile the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information instead of conventional munitions , lives are still at stake .\nPeople are losing their lives because lies about health are often lethal .\nIn the end , I believe the truth will win , because the lies currently told are simply too destructive .\n1 Susan Dunham Medium April 27 , 2022 2 Daily Mail September 9 , 2021 3 , 10 Fox

\u2013 Globalist Path to a One World Order", "content": "I would like to think that many would agree when I say the world we once knew seems to have taken a very strange path , to say the least .\nAs global elites sit comfortably on board of their proverbial public-private partnership super yacht , whilst sipping vintage French XO with their philanthropists cohort and pondering evermore creative ways to keep control of an ever sinking ship , we can only wonder what might be their next diabolical plan .\nWe saw them parading once more at the World Economic Forum \u2019 s annual confab in Davos , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful technocrats gather to discuss the \u2018 big ideas \u2019 , and how they plan to tackle new challenges , and fine tune their elaborate master plans , not least of all warding off another new and sneaky threat , like the latest \u201c disease X \u201d , or as William Henry Gates III likes to call it , \u2018 the next pandemic.\n\u2019 Clearly , a hypothetical disease due to some unknown exotic virus , said to be likely ( or rather unlikely ) to cause a serious pandemic .\nIn 2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health Organization ( WHO ) followed by the World Economic Forum ( WEF ) , added this \u201c disease X \u201d to the list of pathogens that could pose a danger to humanity .\nA truly disturbing prophecy , when just two years later , the world \u2019 s greatest-ever respiratory plague , \u201c Covid-19 \u201d , suddenly emerged to take the world by storm .\nIronically , this pandemic was a perfect model of \u201c disease X \u201d ( how timely ) .\nA true game changer , Covid-19 was presented to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infectious disease that is transmitted between species from animals to humans , or from humans to animals .\nAlready in their starting blocks , the world \u2019 s mainstream media began orchestrating a perfectly harmonised symphony , presenting us with around-the-clock news programs and bulletins , featuring an endless carousel of self-proclaimed science experts , public health mavens , and grandstanding politicians and reiterating the identical script : the introduction of a novel coronavirus allegedly from \u201c an animal reservoir \u201d .\nStill , the origins of the SARSCoV-2 have managed to escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bevy of assumptions and exotic theories , all of which are making it exceedingly difficult for anyone to wrap their heads around where this show-stopper of a virus came from , or if it even exists in nature , much less what actual threat it ever posed to the human race .\nInstead of looking for straight forward evidence of a truly purified and isolated version of the SARSCoV-2 virus , many have instead entertained supernatural \u2018 gain of function \u2019 theories .\nAnd with all that speculation , we are , collectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth what supposedly caused this global upheaval of the last two years .\nThis leads us to the story of \u201c One Health \u201d .\nIn this article , we will chart its origins , from inception to adoption , in the hopes of better understand how this concept has strangely become the handbook for the contagion business , but also possibly the most powerful instrument of control which globalist oligarchs have devised to date .\nIt is also the underlying concept , and virtual cornerstone of a yet to be realised working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ super bureaucratic architecture of this framework is complex and multilayers , but to understand it function and purpose , you only need to remember one thing : whoever controls the \u201c One Health Economies \u201d controls the people , the governments , and by extension , the future of humanity .\nWhat is One Health ?\nThe One Health concept has been in the making for over a decade , but it is now moving into BETA mode .\nAccording to the plans outlined by the WHO and its meticulously assembled One Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One Health is an integrated , unifying approach which aims to sustainably balance and optimize the health of people , animals and ecosystems across the planet .\nIt is the new global society framework upon which all new sustainable development initiatives and transitional systems will be built , and is the basis for the implementation of a new global world order .\nOne Health claims to recognize the health of humans , domestic and wild animals , plants , and the wider environmental ecosystem , as closely linked and \u2018 interdependent \u2019 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and communities at varying levels of society , all meant to work together to foster well-being and tackle emerging threats to health and ecosystems , while addressing the collective need for clean water , energy and air , safe and nutritious food , taking action on climate change , and contributing to the ongoing objective of sustainable development .\nIndeed , it seems they do care very much for our well-being .\nThe importance of establishing a One Health Definition was first raised by the OHHLEP , and later agreed by the four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Nations Quadripartite , tasked with developing a common language and understanding around the new concept of One Health .\nThe WHO , along with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) , the World Organisation for Animal Health ( OIE ) , and more recently the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) , all welcomed the newly formed operational definition of One Health ( my humble experience tells me that rarely people disagree when potentially billions of dollars in public money is about to be thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start by reviewing this Quadripartite ( WHO , FAO , OIE , UNEP ) , the four organizations now working together to mainstream One Health , supposedly conceived in order to help humanity prepare for and prevent , predict , detect , and respond to \u2018 global health \u2019 threats , and promote sustainable development .\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) provides us with a great clue , stated on their website : You may have noticed that One Health has been getting a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantifying diseases \u2019 impact on the economy , a burden can be calculated , even if the methodologies and results remain heavily debated .\nFor example , in a 2011 paper , Making Sense of One Health , we can read comment made by Jean Kamanzi , a Senior Officer at the World Bank and currently with UN FAO Regional Food Safety officer for Africa , estimating that SARS-1 would have cost $ 50 billion , foot and mouth ( FMD ) in the UK $ 30 billion , FMD in Taiwan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( BSE ) in the UK $ 10-13 billion , and Nipah virus in Malaysia $ 350-400 million .\nIn another estimation , economists consider that the emergence of BSE , SARS , Avian flu ( H5N1 ) , and swine flu ( H1N1 ) have caused over $ 20 billion in direct economic losses over the last decade , and in excess of $ 200 billion in indirect losses .\nOne Health claims to solve these problems .\nOnce the importance of infectious diseases was ascertained , the question became , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ?\n\u201c The One Health Approach \u201d was deemed by the Quadripartite to be a valid solution and potential response to address these challenges , but without giving a clear explanation as to why suddenly , as the old global economic model is being collapsed , that all of these exotic viruses are suddenly taking the center stage , and creating what appears to be orchestrated chaos .\nJudging by what we have all witnessed over the last two years in terms of the \u2018 global response \u2019 to COVID-19 , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deal with viruses and epidemics before .\nFollow the money \u2013 One Health and the World Bank For its part , the World Bank has outlined its version of the One Health mission , and has positioned itself as the central player to be added to UN Tripartite ( that was before UNEP came on board ) , as it was difficult to fully exclude them from the formal alliance .\nThe World Bank really pushed hard to implement , One Health , that is , to transform it into a workable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt is also the organization that invested the most heavily in shaping One Health into a coherent and more developed globalist discourse ( since when a bank is a charity ) .\nHowever , at an earlier stage , the World Bank was regarded with caution by the FAO , WHO , OIE , as some were fearing that the World Bank was interpreting One Health as a tool to redefine the role of animals in public health , as the World Bank was said to be aiming to fuse public health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this regard , they have clearly advanced this agenda a long way .\nSuch a fear was certainly justified and transpired in a statement made by Bernard Vallat in 2009 , then the Director General of the OIE , and this is what he said : Here it is important to acknowledge that there are , in fact , pockets of dissent within different globalist institutions .\nThe issue of the merging of public health and animal services was a tense one then , which certainly damaged the architectural efforts by World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of raising funds , and with its will to remain involved in One Health , the World Bank proved to be difficult to set aside , and remains to this day an important partner in managing the governance of One Health .\nNew arrivals to the One Health party There are other organisations which have been at the margins of the One Health for some time , but have since been integrated to the global alliance .\nThese are the United Nations International Children \u2019 s Emergency Fund ( UNICEF ) , United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) .\nAll have embraced the One Health doctrine which emphasizes the need to view human health and well-being as a subset of environmental health .\nThis is a key concept , and one of the foundational principles of One Health , which folds everything into an environmental envelope , along with all the various eco imperatives , including climate change .\nIt seems the global order has a plan , and somehow One Health is at the very heart of it .\nIn November 2020 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these four organisations met to further enhance their cross-sectoral collaboration by creating a multidisciplinary One Health High-Level Expert Panel ( OHHLEP ) , launched by none other than Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , the Director-General of the World Health Organisation , and with the support of the governments of France and Germany .\n.\nThe history of One Health According to their website , the One Health Initiative began as a movement in the United States to forge \u2018 co-equal , all-inclusive collaborations \u2019 between the range of actors and stakeholders in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physicians , nurses , veterinarians , dentists , and other scientific and environmentally related disciplines .\nOther key stakeholder organisations include the American Medical Association , American Veterinary Medical Association , American Academy of Pediatrics , American Nurses Association , American Association of Public Health Physicians , the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) , and the U.S. National Environmental Health Association ( NEHA ) .\nAdditionally , more than 950 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had endorsed the initiative .\nAccording to its description and statement on the US FDA \u2019 s own website , One Health ( formerly called One Medicine ) says it was set-up \u201c to improve the lives of all species , human & animal through the integration of human medicine , veterinary medicine , and environmental science.\n\u201d The CDC , who rapidly became a believer and eventually an umbrella organization for the initiative , provides here a good historical background of One Health and its precursors .\nAlthough it is a globalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2007 , in the United States .\nThe modern , globalized concept of \u201c One World , One Health \u201d was put forward by the Wildlife Conservation Society at a symposium in New York in 2004 hosted by Rockefeller University .\nTo sell the concept , they used case studies on Ebola , Avian Influenza , and Chronic Wasting Disease , as examples of threats to global public health .\nThe assembled expert panelists delineated priorities for an international , interdisciplinary approach for combating threats to \u2018 the health of life on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its surface , it raises a few key questions as to the true motivation of this unprecedented global enterprise .\nWhy won \u2019 t they focus on the world \u2019 s biggest killers , such as Ischaemic heart disease , which is responsible for 16 % of the world \u2019 s total deaths , and rising by more than 2 million to 8.9 million deaths in 2019 according to the WHO ?\nIt is not also worth noting that stroke and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are the second and third leading causes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 6 % ( respectively ) of total deaths worldwide ?\nHow about lower respiratory infections that remained the world \u2019 s most deadly communicable disease , ranked as the fourth leading cause of death .\nSo why are all of these tropical and other diseases suddenly considered \u2018 major threats \u2019 , thus forcing the scientific world to revisit the way there were looking at global public health ?\nAccording to their literature , \u201c One World , One Health \u201d is based on a set of principles referred to as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the One World , One Health event who presented their list of 12 recommendations ( see here ) for establishing \u2018 a more holistic approach \u2019 to preventing supposed epizootic diseases , and also \u201c for maintaining ecosystem integrity \u2019 for the benefit of humans , their domesticated animals , and also \u2018 for the foundational biodiversity that supports us all.\n\u201d It is also worth noting also the Berlin Principles on One Health , which were formatted at the 2019 One World , One Health , One Future Conference sponsored by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) in partnership with the Wildlife Conservation Society ( WCS ) .\nWe can now see how this ambitious framework seeks to combine human and animal health into one singularity , and to pool the risk of alleged \u2018 outbreaks \u2019 under the same umbrella of \u2018 global public health.\n\u2019 The implications of this are immense , and should not be understated .\nIn 2020 , a \u201c One World , One Health , One Future \u201d virtual event was held under the same patronage .\nThe concept was developed by six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Framework entitled , \u201c Contributing to One World , One Health : A Strategic Framework for Reducing Risks of Infectious Diseases at the Animal-Human-Ecosystems Interface \u201d at the International Ministerial Conference on Avian and Pandemic Influenza , held in Sharm el-Sheikh , Egypt , October 2008 .\nRepresentatives included specialists from the WHO , the UN Food and Agriculture Organization ( FOA ) , CDC , the United States Geological Survey National Wildlife Health Center ( USGS ) , the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) , the Canadian Cooperative Wildlife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laboratoire Nationale de Sante Publique of Brazzaville in the Republic of Congo ( LNSP-CG ) , the IUCN Commission on Environmental Law , and the Wildlife Conservation Society ( WCS ) , among other stakeholders .\nSince there was insufficient time to discuss the Framework at the meeting in Egypt , Canada agreed to host an addendum international expert consultation .\nThis was held from March 16-19 , 2009 , in Winnipeg .\nIt was done under the auspices of the Public Health Agency of Canada \u2019 s Centre for Food-borne , Environmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who also hosted the One World One Health Expert Consultation in Manitoba .\nBeside the usual suspects , one must note the participation of UNICEF , as well as the World Bank , and the bio surveillance agency , the United Nations System Influenza Coordination ( UNSIC ) .\nSubsequently , The One Health Commission was formed to facilitate the coordination of these organizations , and in November 2009 a One Health Summit was held in partnership with the National Academies of Science in Washington , D.C .\nThe event \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ USDA , CDC , FDA , NIEHS , USAID , members of academia , state governments , and the Kansas Bioscience Organization also participated .\n.\nAlso at the event , Rear Admiral Ali Khan , Acting Director of The National Center for Zoonotic , Vector-Borne , and Enteric Diseases at the CDC , spoke on the topic of \u201c One Health in Action.\n\u201d I am not sure if he knew how far this initiative would go , but he clearly had a specific vision and plan , as one would expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is very likely that the eventual blueprint for One Health was born that day .\nIt \u2019 s crucial to note that this event was taking place in the midst of the 2009 H1N1 Swine Flu pseudo pandemic , which was later exposed by a number of researchers and journalists as an over-hyped global event , but one which helped the WHO and other actors consolidate more bureaucratic power and authority in terms of declaring pandemics , and helping to spearhead the global distribution of pharmaceutical \u2018 solutions \u2019 such as Tamiflu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , Rear Admiral Khan did not miss the chance to remind the audience that as of November 8 , 2009 , the World Health Organization reported over 503,000 alleged confirmed \u2018 cases \u2019 of H1N1 , and at least 6,260 deaths from the influenza .\nHe identified key factors in the influenza \u2019 s emergence , including \u201c microbial adaptation , changing ecosystems , international travel and commerce , and human susceptibility to infection.\n\u201d Again , the animal and \u2018 zoonosis \u2019 angle is centre stage here .\nDr. Khan underscored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease emergence at the interface of animals , humans and environmental health.\n\u201d He also called for \u201c looking beyond humans to expand opportunities for disease detection , control and prevention.\n\u201d Dr. Khan outlined five key steps for success in this endeavor , all of which are designed to solidify the centralization of power and authority around new alleged pandemics : \u2022 None Integration : develop diagnostic platforms for use in humans , animals and the environment \u2022 None Research : create new tools to identify pathogens and approaches for integrating information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partnerships across sectors in the U.S. and abroad At this point , it is difficult to deny that 13 years ago this globalist confab had already figured out a blueprint for an agenda which was fully activated in 2020. .\nThe One Health Initiative Task Force Members who were part of the One Health Commission , have since been integrated the CDC , and have now become the US Center for Disease Control ( CDC ) One Health Office .\nCDC \u2019 s One Health Office has become the agency \u2019 s lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and globally .\nEstablished in 2009 , it was the first formal office dedicated to One Health in an established US federal agency .\nToday , their office is located within the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases ( NCEZID ) at CDC in Atlanta .\nAs a functioning public relations arm , One Health Office is also tasked with promoting the \u201c One Health approach , \u201d and to increase awareness of CDC \u2019 s role in One Health in the United States and around the world .\nA few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when looking at the US partners involved in this initiative ( USDA , CDC , FDA ,

financial support to companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are detailed in my previous article , Pentagon-Ukraine Bio Labs : The Hunter Biden Connections .\nAs mentioned above , the 2004 One World , One Health Symposium which was held in New York was put forward by the Field Wildlife Conservation Society , where Dr. William B.

interface and wildlife health .\nDr. Karesh was also the Emerging Pandemic Threats ( EPT ) , as well as Partner Liaison for the USAID PREDICT-2 bio surveillance program .\nTo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious skepticism about many of the widely held assumptions regarding Gain of Function ( GOF ) claims and its theoretical basis , which has been conveniently pushed by numerous media outlets and politicians as the answer to all of our unanswered questions regarding the supposed \u201c origins of Covid.\n\u201d However , I do support a continued open debate on this issue .\nWhile One Health has over the past 15 years established itself in the life sciences , veterinary medicine , and biomedical sciences , it still remains obscured from public view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research contained in this article .\nOne thing for is for sure : the One health Commission seems to be following very closely the development of the COVID-19 pandemic , and is now urgently recommending the need to implement the One Health approach globally .\nIf you take the time to follow the links featured one the One Health Commission \u2019 s webpage , you will find a plethora of information explaining the role which One Health played in the COVID-19 response , and much more .\nYou will also learn how in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembled to help parameterise complex mathematical and resource models , and how in New South Wales , Australia , state authorities \u201c engaged collaboratively with animal health veterinarians and epidemiologists to leverage disease outbreak knowledge , expertise and technical and support structures for application to the COVID-19 emergency.\n\u201d You will also discover how the African One Health University Network linked members from various health institutions and universities from eight countries to provide a virtual platform for knowledge exchange on COVID-19 in order to support the global response .\nAs you would expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these knowledge sharing platforms , the same sort of modeling sold to governments by the likes of Imperial College epidemiologist Neil Ferguson , who wildly exaggerated the projected death toll from COVID back in the spring of 2020 .\nIt was these overinflated imaginary models which were used to justify lockdowns and other harmful virus mitigation policies .\nAs you will read in the 2015 One Health Commission history PDF document , the One health Commission was invited to participate in the International One Health Platform Foundation .\nOf course , the billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the One Health Platform Foundation , and who is behind it ?\nThe One-Health Platform ( also seen here at www.onehealthplatform.com ) was founded in 2015 , and describes itself as a \u201c scientific resource center and a hub for stakeholders in One Health.\n\u201d It claims to be an autonomous , non-profit organization , and is accompanied by the World One Health Congress as the largest \u201c One Health \u201d event of the year for experts and researchers from around the world , serialised in its One Health Outlook , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promote the collaboration , connection and rapid sharing of information within all fields of research relevant to One Health through open access publishing.\n\u201d The management board on the One Health Platform is made up of Professor Ab Osterhaus , known throughout the world for his work on SARS1 and H5N1 , the pathogen alleged to have causes avian influenza , Professor John Mackenzie , and Professor Chris Vanlangendonck .\nDuring the course of my research , some key clues emerged which reinforced my belief that the One Health Platform and its One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the right direction as to who else is driving this globalised operation .\nFinding people such as Christian Drosten ( author of the problematic RT-PCR \u2018 gold standard \u2019 assay for the WHO ) , Peter Daszak ( CEO EcoHealth Alliance ) , William Karesh ( DVM , EcoHealth Alliance ) as part of the One Health Outlook Editorial Board certainly motivated me to dig further .\nThe One Health Outlook is headed by Editor-in-Chief , Ab Osterhaus PhD , Research Center of Emerging Infections and Zoonoses , Germany at the University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TiHo who is a member of the German Center for Infection Research ( DZIF ) , under whose umbrella about 150 scientists from 27 institutions at seven locations cooperate .\nHere is a video of Ab Osterhaus known also as \u2018 Dr Flu \u2019 in his capacity of scientific advisor for the Artemis One Health Foundation in the Netherlands .\nAlbert Osterhaus is no small fish , and his name keeps on appearing in many corruption scandals such as the notorious \u201c Mexican Flu \u201d scandal .\nOsterhaus is amongst the leading One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contentious \u201c spillover theory \u201d which advances the narrative that wherever humans further encroach on the natural world , pushing into the territories of animals , it brings them into contact with new and exotic microbes that live there , and which sometimes jump across species boundaries in \u201c zoonotic \u201d fashion , where they allegedly mutate and cause diseases .\nIs it true ?\nWhile it currently serves are the basis for all the entire global apparatus we have shown already , and is widely regarded as the consensus in mainstream virology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debatable , and may not be the global threat it is touted as .\nI was surprised ( or perhaps not ) to find out that One Health Platform was also registered in 2015 as a company headed by Ab Osterhaus , registered at 35 22nd St East , Saskatoon , Saskatchewan , S7K 0C8 , Canada , and at No1 Zevensterstraat , Laarne , Flanders , 9270 in Belgium , the country where the European Council is headquartered , and we will see later why this may be important .\nOne Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is impossible to describe the One Health Platform without including the International One Health Coalition ( IOHC ) , a collaborative partnership between the One Health Platform and existing international governmental and non-governmental organizations and institutions .\nThe IOHC claims to reinforce the One Health concept where the coalition partners can set up a framework for information-sharing , cooperation and awareness raising activities .\nThrough the International One Health Coalition , the foundation builds a global community of One Health stakeholders including with the Pentagon \u2019 s Defense Threat Reduction Agency ( DTRA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foundation , the CDC , and many more .\nDuring the 75th World Health Assembly held in Geneva , Switzerland , held on 22-28 May 2022 , French President Emmanuel Macron inserted a brief remark regarding One Health , and knowing this president , this was not a coincidence .\nIt was for surely a coded message addressed to the global health policymakers , confirming that One Health was on track and should be fully integrated in the new Global Health Security Policy structure .\nThis represents a big step , especially at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pandemic prevention , preparedness and response is being negotiated between the European Council and the WHO .\nSee the full video here .\nEmmanuel Macron pushing the One health agenda at the 75th World Health Assembly : On January 1 , 2021 , a former French government agency known as the ANRS ( Emerging Infectious Diseases ) was restructured into an autonomous body under the roof of another French public agency , Inserm .\nThis new independent body was created with the mission of funding , coordinating and leading research on various infectious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STIs and tuberculosis , and also the bevy of emerging respiratory infections including Covid-19 , viral hemorrhagic fevers , arboviruses and many more .\nThe French government was now relying on the ANRS and on the scientific consortium known as REACTing and its expertise , in responding to crises related to emerging diseases .\nBoth organisation ended up merging in December 2020 , but kept the acronym ANRS .\nAmongst the ANRS international partners you will find the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , Anthony Fauci \u2019 s NIH/NIAID ( National Institute of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WHO , and the DZIF ( German Center for Infection Research ) , just to name a few ( see a full list here ) .\nIt \u2019 s important to note that all these organizations were deeply involved in pushing the global COVID-19 vaccination program .\nThe ANRS is also the sponsor of numerous therapeutic trials .\nThese are mainly aimed at evaluating new therapeutic strategies like vaccines .\nAs a result , the ANRS engages in collaborations with the biggest transnational pharmaceutical companies .\nWhilst the ANRS was building international partnerships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focusing on human and animal health and the impact of humans on the environment , the agency prepared the response to the scientific challenges posed by emerging diseases , and was was placed under the supervision of the Ministry of Higher Education , Research and Innovation and the Ministry of Solidarity and Health .\nThe ANRS is headed by none other than Dr Yazdan Yazdanpanah , a key figure and influencer in the COVID 19 narrative in France as well as in the WHO .\nIn France , the drug Chloroquine was banned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider any other treatment , under penalty of state sanction and prosecution by the Medical Council , or the courts .\nThis was attributed to the intense lobbying of the ANRS by Inserm and its Aviesan partners ( partners in Africa , Asia and Polynesia ) , including the Pasteur Institute , as active stakeholders , and working on the following : H5N1 and H1N1 influenza , SARS , Mers\u2010Co , Chikungunya , Ebola and Zika vaccines .\nSuch obvious conflicts of interest is a big problem in France , and the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its AVESIAN partners are believed to have taken part in France \u2019 s Public Health Defence Council , which is responsible for coordinating the country \u2019 s COVID-19 national crisis policy and associated meetings under a strict veil of secrecy afforded by the Defence and National Security Council responsible for crisis public health decisions .\nThis is what the US national security apparatus refers to as a \u2018 Need to Know Basis.\n\u2019 Furthermore , Prof. Yazdan Yazdanpanah is also the member of the French Covid\u201019 scientific committee , with the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is occupying an executive role in the pandemic preparedness and response in France and internationally .\nIt is somewhat concerning to see all the movers and shakers of the COVID-19 \u2018 global pandemic \u2019 response \u2013 all promoting One Health , especially knowing they have been financed by the pharmaceutical giants such as Gilead Sciences , Pfizer , Johnson & Johnson , MSD , and with the active participation of J\u00e9r\u00f4me SALOMON , France Director General of Health ( DGS ) .\nIn this 2020 Session of the Veterinary Academy of France , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d we can see Dr St\u00e9phane de la Roque , Team Leader of the One Health Team \u2019 s Country Emergency Preparedness and IHR at the Word health Organisation ( WHO ) , together with ANRS Director General , Prof. Yazdan Yazdanpanah , discussing the need for a global \u201c One Health \u201d system .\nI therefore submit the idea that One Health has played and will keep on playing a strategic role in the context of the WHO \u2019 s International Health Regulations ( IHR ) , and therefore in the handling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course in all future pandemics .\nAll this points inevitably in the direction of the proposed WHO Pandemic Treaty and the IHR reforms currently under negotiation at the European Council and at the WHO , where One Health will provide the working framework for a new layer of global governance .\nWe recall a special session of the World Health Assembly ( WHA ) , which was convened in late 2021 to consider developing a WHO convention , agreement or other international instrument , on pandemic preparedness and response , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was given to this treaty as well as to reform of the International Health Regulations ( IHR ) as the principal governing instrument empowering the WHO even further in supposedly preventing and mitigating future pandemics .\nThis is just another \u201c Carte Blanche \u201d power for the WHO and its well known sponsors such a Bill Gates and others , to abuse nations \u2019 sovereignty and bypass their democratic processes in order to impose a centralised , top-down global \u2018 public health \u2019 regime .\nIn the following document ( the first page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the declaration by Prof. Yazdan Yazdanpanah about the potential conflict of interest with pharmaceutical companies .\nThe original document is available here but can also be fund on the Website of the French Ministry of Health here .\nIn the picture below , the GloPID-R chair Prof. Yazdan Yazdanpanah and WHO DG Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus can be seen together at the opening of the Global research & innovation forum .\nProf Yazdanpanah is also an expert at the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) , the guy is everywhere .\nSince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an international network of major research funding organizations created to facilitate a rapid and effective response to infectious disease outbreaks , has steadily increased its membership .\nToday , it consists of 32 members worldwide .\nGates-funded organisations like the World Health Organization , the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations ( CEPI ) , along with the European & Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership ( EDCTP ) , are also actively engaged in the network .\nIn 2021 , the African Union ( AU ) through the African Centres for Disease Control and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership ( EDCTP ) , all signed a Memorandum of Understanding ( MoU ) aimed at establishing a framework to serve as a firm basis for cooperation in their shared goals to promote a new paradigm to drive new trends in \u2018 global health.\n\u2019 The MoU covers implementation and public health research , the One Health approach , and data management .\nI will leave you with one more clue , as I could probably go on for few more pages talking about Prof. Yazdan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health Global Network and the Big Pharma industrial complex .\nHere we can see him summarising the achievements of three years and a half of the EU-JAMRAI , the European Union Joint Action on Antimicrobial Resistance ( AMR ) , and its role of developing and implementing the One Health policies as a partner of the European One Health Programme ( OHEJP ) .\nThe ANSES , the French Agency for Food , Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety , also leads the One Health concept efforts .\nThis is illustrated in particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two collaborative projects on this theme .\nThe first , the One Health major area of interest ( DIM ) project , funded by the Ile-de-France region from 2017 to 2021 , brings together numerous animal and human health research teams in the region .\nThe Agency plays a center role in coordinating the One Health European Joint Programme ( EJP ) from 2018-2023 , where ANSES is coordinating the project while working closely with the Belgian partner Sciensano on coordination of the programme \u2019 s scientific activities .\nThe ANSES laboratories \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 23 research projects selected within the framework of the EJP .\nThe National Research Institute for Agriculture , Food and Environment ( INRAE ) is another leading research organization in France with a very clear focus on One Health .\nThe INRAE claims it is the first research institute in the world specialized in the interdependent fields of agriculture , food and the environment , hence the reason why this French government agency conducts research and carries out projects with a \u201c One Health approach , \u201d while developing interdisciplinary research at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAlso , CIRAD is a French agricultural research and cooperation organization working for the sustainable development of tropical and Mediterranean regions .\nAnother French agency involved deeply in the promotion of One Health , you can read on their website , \u201c The \u201c One Health \u201d concept must be institutionalized to prevent new epidemics on a global scale.\n\u201d Now it \u2019 s really starting to look more like a cult , with all of its well rehearsed mantras .\nLiving in France , I have had the chance to observe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French Government during the COVID-19 pandemic , and I must say it was very confusing with recommendations often far removed from any scientific facts , to say the least .\nThey eventually issued their opinion on One Health ( see document below ) which was later sent to the national authorities on February 8 , 2022 and made available to the public .\n.\nTill today , a substantial part of the French population remains very skeptic of the COVID-19 pandemic and the origins of SARS-CoV-2 , not to mention the liberticide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis .\nI guess we just want to know why our government is so focused on One Health and Zoonotic matters , especially with the announcement of upcoming new measure for the \u201c new virus on the block \u201d know as the Monkeypox .\nIn a public press release , the new head of the French Ministry of Health Brigitte Bourguignon , highlighted the efforts made to put in place preventive measures and plans to fight against the \u201c Monkeypox \u201d in accordance with the WHO International Health Regulations .\nHere we go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virus , literally out of nowhere , doesn \u2019 t sit well with many who feel that they are once more taken for a ride .\nThe One Health Economy : Global Command and Control From the evidence in my research , we can clearly see how One Health is a platform concept is being used by the globalists \u2019 various Public-Private Partnerships and stakeholder entities \u2013 in order to maintain and manage a constant threat of virus outbreaks and \u2018 possible pandemics , \u2019 and its acceptance via a multidisciplinary set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Global Heath Security Policy agenda .\nWhile One Health may have been also used as a lobbying tool for industry , it is has without question been completely hijacked by the globalists to justify any number of emergency measures , as well as future global vaccination roll-outs , and more importantly to force populations around the world to surrender , little by little , their liberties and freedoms .\nBut there is more to it\u2026 They feel they want us to feel scared , but also guilty too .\nThis is where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play , and the role populations may have played in breaking down the equilibrium of the biodiversity and its ecosystems , creating endless \u201c spillover \u201d theories , which naturally gives birth over time , to the wider goal in all of this \u2013 which is a very lucrative One Health Economy .\nOn could say that the One Health Agenda is certainly instrumental in influencing people to accept an entirely new global paradigm , one that forces society to live under a new set of rigid rules of control \u2013 like one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your new digital ID .\nThis is where One Health integrates into the new cashless digital economy described by World Economic Forum ( WEF ) luminary Klaus Schwab and fellow technocrats .\nConsider how the One Health imperative which they have carefully assembled \u2013 now provides the moral and ethical imperative needed to glue the new digital money and health passport system into place internationally .\nIf you thought the globalists had enough control already , you might be wrong , as they seem to want to control everything including our spending habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health , our ability to transact , and even what even we eat .\nThis short list is unfortunately far from complete .\nOne Health and the environment We still will need a much better understand how the One Health Agenda plugs itself into the all-important \u2018 biodiversity threat \u2019 and climate change narratives that has been pushed for quite some time now .\nStill , we must pose the initial question : is there any validity to these threats , or is it another tool designed to engineer guilt , fear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this article from the New York Times published on June 17 , 2020 , comes across as an extraordinary piece of propaganda which encapsulates a set of ideas that is being strongly pushed onto the public , especially during the COVID-19 pandemic ( or plandemic , as some might describe it ) , where humans have supposedly unleashed a flood of diseases after they started destroying habitats and ruining ecosystems .\nNot surprisingly , their article cites people in the like of Jonathan Epstein , Vice President for science and outreach at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the media \u2019 s One Health echo chamber .\nBut the overriding message is clear : we must now merge public health and the environment , and do it globally .\nThe United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) published on their website the transcript of a speech given on 17 March 2022 by Inger Andersen , Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations and Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme , during the 28th United Nations Environment Assembly ( UNEA ) Tripartite Annual Executive Meeting , and this is what he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removing population from natural environments such as coastal regions and forests and green pastures seems to be maturing , if not already part of the UN Agenda 2030 and its long term vision to \u2018 re-wild \u2019 farms and greenbelt lands , and herd world populations into increasingly crowded smart cities , and other centres in preparation for the Fourth Industrial Revolution .\nThat would be one way to gain control ( way to go WEF ! )\n.\nChristian Westbrook from Ice Age Farmer did an excellent job at breaking it down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe United Nation Development ( UNEP ) is also adding its weight by reminding us that our civilization \u2018 faces a global biodiversity emergency , a climate emergency , and a public health emergency , all stemming from the destruction of nature.\n\u2019 That \u2019 s right , they want to transform the biodiversity alleged crisis into an opportunity , of course they do !\nRead more\u2026 Does this not sound like fearmongering to you ?\nBack to the One Health Platform , which aims also at supporting attendance of the International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of One Health from low and middle income countries and to promote the health and productivity of livestock in developing countries by reducing the impact of \u2018 neglected zoonotic diseases.\n\u2019 This is where environmental and climate agenda and the alleged \u2018 zoonotic \u2019 pandemic trigger come together to allow for a comprehensive approach to implementing their new technocracy .\nOrganizations such as the International Centre for Well-Being ( ICWB ) supported by the Gates Foundation are amongst the grantees of the One Health Platform .\nMany of you will have heard on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopting a decision to authorise the opening of negotiations with the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) for an international agreement ( treaty ) on pandemic prevention , preparedness and response .\nNow take a look at the European Council promotional video for the Pandemic Treaty , where they sell it to you like if it was for the safety of future generations , when in fact it is only about taking away EU countries right to self-determine their health policies , regulations and laws .\nIt is simply scandalous .\nWatch : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for pushing for such international treaty ; a legally binding under international law agreement on pandemic prevention , preparedness and response to be adopted under the World Health Organization ( WHO ) ?\nThe European Council claims this would enable countries around the globe to strengthen national , regional and global capacities and resilience to future pandemics , but is this truly their goal or just another step to World Governance ?\nYou decide\u2026 \u201c The proposed WHO agreement is unnecessary , and is a threat to sovereignty and inalienable rights \u2019 said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases the WHO \u2019 s suffocating power to declare unjustified pandemics , impose dehumanizing lock-downs , and enforce expensive , unsafe , and ineffective treatments against the will of the people.\n\u201d Many who favor a treaty believe it offers the best way to increase political commitment from states to reform global health governance , however the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that this ws a hollow proposition .\nIn fact , government responses to COVID-19 have purportedly violated or manipulated many conventions and treaties , including the WHO Constitution , International Health Regulations ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nGovernment responses to COVID-19 have purportedly violated or manipulated many treaties , but was \u2018 ONE Health \u2019 included in the preparation of this proposed international treaty who was referred to in 2021 as a framework convention ?\nThe answer is YES .\nNote that on page 8 of the following WHO International Treaty Framework Convention for pandemic preparedness and response document , you can see \u2018 One Health \u2019 is included in the legal considerations which demonstrates that One Health was part of the plan all along , confirming that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knowing that Charles Michel , a Belgian politician serving as President of the European Council since 2019 , will be a key signatory for the proposed Pandemic Treaty together with WHO head Dr Tedros Adanson Ghebreyesus , and the fact that the Gates Foundation is the second-largest contributor to the WHO and a partner of the One Health International Coalition , it is fair to assume that the One Health platform , which is now fully endorsed by the Quadripartite WHO-OIE\u2013FAO\u2013UNEP , without mentioning Gates-funded Big Pharma vehicles GAVI and COVAX , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if not engineering this controversial Pandemic Treaty in order to influence and gain some form of control over the decision-making process and mechanism associated with the Global Health Security Agenda ( GHSA ) by utlilising a systematised One Health Approach in everything they do .\nThink of it as their own customised bureaucratic framework for maximizing their own interests , whatever that may be .\nThere are certainly some very suspicious synergies between this treaty and what Bill Gates describes in his latest book How to Prevent the Next Pandemic , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required to be prepared for \u201c the next pandemic.\n\u201d In the following video , Gates breaks down his three recommended steps , with the second step being the creation of a permanent organization of experts \u2013 who are fully paid and prepared to mount a coordinated response to a dangerous outbreak at any time .\nIn his book , he proposes to call this group the GERM a Global Epidemic Response & Mobilization team based out of WHO \u2019 s regional offices and likely in its headquarters in Geneva .\nWatch : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts would look for potential outbreaks and once it spots one , GERM should have the ability to declare an outbreak and work with national governments and the World Bank to raise money for the response very quickly .\nProduct development experts would then advise governments and companies on the highest-priority drugs and vaccines .\nPeople who understand computer modeling would coordinate the work of modelers around the world in order to calculate the spread of the alleged virus .\nAnd the team would help create and coordinate responses , such as how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lockdowns , social distancing , and impose the use of masks .\nNaturally , Bill wants to be in charge of front running this project .\nAccording to Gates , GERM \u2019 s response to an active outbreak would only one part of their work .\nThe team \u2019 s most important job is helping to run outbreak response exercises that \u2018 test whether the world is ready \u2019 for the next major outbreak .\nMilitaries regularly run war games to evaluate their readiness , and so Bill goes on by saying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any potential virus and disease threats .\nIn most countries , these exercises would be run by local public health and military leaders , where GERM would act as an advisor and reviewer of their operations .\nYou might want to take the time to listen to Bill Gates TED Talk where he talks about GERM in great length .\nWe can establish that Bill Gates and Charles Michel ( President of the European Council ) actually know each other , and enjoy a working relationship , if not a friendship .\nFunny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a story better than words\u2026 It has now become quite clear that in the context of the Global Health Security Agenda ( GHSA ) , part of the United Nations 2030 Agenda , there is a concentrated effort to push a narrative , associated with the COVID-19 pandemic , to establish a new biosecurity and biothreat landscape , creating the illusion of gaps in biosafety and biosecurity surveillance and response capabilities .\nIn other words , we are not safe , and so we need an entirely new and global layer of regulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place .\nWhy is that ?\nAnd what is the ultimate goal ?\nWe will go back to this in a moment .\nIf you haven \u2019 t already seen it , I invite you to take the time to watch the following video called \u201c The Plan \u201d which provides background , but also a glimpse on future potential events to come ( full video ) .\nWatch : .\nCould this help explaining why so much Biosafety-Biosecurity government programs have flourished around the world over the last past 8 year ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ all avidly embracing the One Health Approach and the massive budgets and support that comes with its adoption .\nRead my recent article on Germany \u2019 s Biosecurity Program and the The Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology ( IMB ) a military research facility of the German Armed Forces involved in Ukraine .\nNow , going back to the newly formed Quadripartite WHO\u2013FAO\u2013OIE\u2013UNEP , it is important to take the time to describe The One Health High-Level Expert Panel ( OHHLEP ) who is going to take on an important advisory role for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 proposed Global Epidemic Response & Mobilization Team ( GERM ) .\nThis high level panel claims to contribute to advancing the One Health Agenda , by helping to better understand the root causes of disease emergence and spread , and informing decision-makers to prevent long-term public health risks .\nIt all sounds altruistic enough .\nThe OHHLEP is made up of 26 independent experts selected by the big four international organizations ( FAO , OIE , UNEP , WHO ) .\nOne French expert is a member of the panel : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research supervisor at the French National Centre for Scientific Research ( CNRS ) and a researcher at the French Agricultural Research Centre for International Development ( CIRAD ) .\nHowever , the high level panel is chaired by the German national Thomas Mettenleiter , President of the Institute Council of the Friedrich Loeffler Institute ( FLI ) and Wanda Markotter , Director of the University of Pretoria \u2019 s Centre for Viral Zoonoses in South Africa ( who is also known as the African Bat Lady ) , will go back to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ High-Level Expert Panel first meeting was held in Paris 17-18 May 2021 .\nA press conference was organized by WHO on Thursday , 20 May 2021 in the presence of Jean-Yves Le Drian , former French Minister of Defense and current French Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs , who presented this new body responsible for prevention of diseases of animal origin .\nFollowing my recent article on The German Military Biological Program in Ukraine , I was not surprised at all to see Thomas Mettenleiter , the President of the German Institute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FLI ) spearheading this outfit .\nThe Friedrich Loeffler Institute ( FLI ) is strongly invested in Ukraine with their own string of biolabs projects accompanied by the Institute for Microbiology of the German Armed Forces .\nThey were working on a Biosecurity project \u201c Ukrainian-German biosecurity initiative for zoonoses risk management near the EU external border \u201d ( they could have said the Russian border ) part of Germany Biosecurity Programme funded by the German Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs .\n.\nLet \u2019 s go back briefly to South Africa where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UPOH ) network was initiated in 2020 to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic , and in partnership with UNICEF \u2019 s Humanitarian Programme through its flagship Programme known as \u201c Generation Unlimited \u201d .\nThis initiative is part of Future Africa and specifically the \u201c One Health \u201d cluster which activities and focus area spearheaded by Prof. Markotter who happens to be the research chair at UNICEF Future Africa and the number two at the One Health High-Level Expert Panel .\nWas it a coincidence that Omicron was first detected in South Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of you will also remember Dr. Angelique Coetzee , the South African Doctor who supposedly discovered the Omicron strain , and who later revealed how she was \u2018 pressured \u2019 into describing the variant as much more dangerous than it really was .\nDr Coetzee was a chairperson of the South African Medical Association ( SAMA ) and was quickly asked to step down .\nShe clearly wasn \u2019 t in the know , but the South Africa Medical Association ( SAMA ) certainly was .\nIn 2018 , it was SAMA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done , separately and jointly , to actualise the collaborative implementation of One Health in South Africa .\nDr. Angelique Coetzee was one of the first to report the new variant in November 2021 , confirming it was causing only \u2018 mild \u2019 symptoms for those in her country .\nI believe Dr Coetzee was intimidated , which could indicate she was interfering with a big plan which she was not privy to .\nTelling the truth does have a cost in the \u201c Need to Know \u201d business .\nTake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pandemic Prevention and Response , where One Health is sponsored by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development ( BMZ ) since 2021 , and until at least 2024 .\nIt is worth noting that GIZ who describes itself as a service provider in the field of international cooperation for sustainable development and international education work , is a joint stock company with the legal form of a limited liability company , it is recognised as a public-benefit organisation who happens to make billions in revenue each year .\nNo surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German Epidemic Preparedness Team ( SEEG ) .\nThe SEEG Team support Germany , but also partner countries in their efforts to prepare and respond to disease outbreaks at short notice , flexibly , professionally , and globally .\nTo capitalize on synergies and profit from existing expertise , the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut ( FLI ) , Robert Koch Institute ( RKI ) , the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine ( BNITM ) , the Charit\u00e9 Universit\u00e4tsmediz in Berlin are cooperating in this project .\nFor those interested in digging deeper into Germany and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the COVID pandemic , I invite you to take a look at Charit\u00e9 Berlin Institute of Health ( BIH ) .\nThe BIH is funded 90 percent by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research ( BMBF ) and 10 percent by the State of Berlin .\nThe two founding institutions , Charit\u00e9 \u2013 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin and Max Delbr\u00fcck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association ( The Helmholtz Association is Germany \u2019 s largest scientific research organization with 40,000 staff working in its 18 scientific technical and bio-medical research centres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget amounts to more than \u20ac4.7 billion ( just follow the money ) .\nThe Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research ( FIZ ) launched in 26 April 2022 the Helmholtz Institute for One Health ( HIOH ) in Greifswald \u2013 Germany .\nCoincidence ?\nAs it turns out , the Helmholtz Institute for One Health ceremony enjoyed the presence of Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu , Assistant Director General at the World Health Organization ( WHO ) and leading the WHO Hub for Pandemic and Epidemic Intelligence .\nThe architect of this WHO Hub for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else than Jens Georg Spahn the former German Federal Minister of Health under the leadership of Chancellor Dr Angela Merkel .\nSpahn was also the architect of Germany \u2019 s Digital Wallet/Vaccine Passport program .\nWhat a small World\u2026 Video : Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu , Assistant Director General at WHO addressing the HIOH : On the occasion of the World Health Summit in October 2020 , Germany \u2019 s Development Minister Gerd Mueller announced the creation of a new One Health area within his Ministry .\nThis is one of the many statements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Summit : \u201c In view of the COVID-19 pandemic , we will massively expand the priority area of One Health and pandemic prevention , \u201d Mueller said .\n\u201c Parliamentary State Secretary Maria Flachsbarth is to coordinate our international cooperation as the BMZ \u2019 s Commissioner for global health and One Health.\n\u201d Maria Flachsbarth is an ex-Officio Member of the Board of Governors of the African Development Bank ( AfDB ) from 2018\u20132021 ) .\nMueller further explained that the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation & Development ( BMZ ) was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Global Emergency COVID-19 Support Programme into the One Health program .\nThis funding would be used to set up a first One Health pandemic centre in Kenya to promote knowledge sharing on human and animal health .\n\u201c We are strengthening food safety and early detection of zoonoses in food production together with the World Bank , \u201d Mueller added .\nOn that day , One Health was officially institutionalised in Germany .\nLet \u2019 s move on and take a look at the One Health European Joint Programme ( OHEJP ) \u2026 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( OHEJP ) was launched on 1st January 2018 in which more than , the Friedrich Loeffler Institute ( was launched on 1st January 2018 in which more than 40 partners from 19 European countries are participating .\n\u201c Antimicrobial resistance and threats through new pathogens are controversial examples of the extent to which the health and illness of humans , animals and the environment are linked together , \u201d said Professor Dr. Andreas Hensel , President of the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment ( BfR ) .\n\u201c A joint European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health can help to counter microbial risks effectively.\n\u201d The German partners of the European Joint Programme on One Health are the BfR the Friedrich Loeffler Institute ( FLI ) and the Robert Koch Institute ( RKI ) .\nThe One Health European Joint Programme ( OHEJP ) was created on the back of the MedVetNet network of excellence and the MedVetNet Association , One Health EJP was started with mainly reference laboratories for infectious disease in humans and animals aiming to integrate and align work processes of joint priority and through joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the consortium members of OHEJP .\nThe project will run until the end of 2022. .\nAccording to their Website , the goal of the European Joint Programme ( EJP ) is to build up a European platform for One Health which satisfies the needs of European and national political decision makers and interest groups ( stakeholders ) .\nTo this end , European institutions from the fields of medicine , veterinary medicine and consumer health protection in the food sector are to expand their cooperation in order to achieve progress in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( infections transferred between humans and animals ) , antimicrobial resistance , and new infection hazards ( emerging threats ) .\nThe examination of infectious pathogens which can be transferred from animals to humans seems to be an important focal point of the European One Health Programme .\nThe programme fits within the EU framework programme for research and innovation \u201c Horizon 2020 \u201d succeeded by \u201c Horizon Europe \u201c , and sponsored by the European Commission .\nThe One Health EJP ( Grant Agreement 773830 ) was headed by the French Agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Safety ( ANSES ) .\nCurrently , ANSES is working on Programme Parc the European Partnership for the Assessment of Risks from Chemicals funded by Horizon Europe , a project seeking to develop next-generation chemical risk assessment , incorporating both human health and the environment in a \u201c One Health \u201d approach .\nThe One Health EJP aim is to generate scientific data , methods and software programs which can be used by national and European institutions to assess health risks and possible preventive measures .\nAn exchange with other large-scale projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guaranteed at the same time .\nOne of the tasks will be the efficient and regular transfer of knowledge between the research community and national authorities , as well as international and European stakeholders .\nEveryone working together in a vacuum \u2013 which is very similar to how military intelligence tends to operate .\nAt the OHEJP , the One Health concept recognises that human health is tightly connected to the health of animals and the environment , for example that animal feed , human food , animal and human health , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line with the \u201c Prevent-Detect-Respond \u201d concept , the main focus of the new OHEJP is to reinforce collaboration between institutes by enhancing transdisciplinary cooperation and integration of activities by means of dedicated Joint Research Projects , Joint Integrative Project and through education and training in the fields of Foodborne Zoonoses ( FBZ ) , Antimicrobial Resistance ( AMR ) and Emerging Threats ( ET ) .\nEarlier above we saw French President Emmanuel Macron pushing the One Health Agenda during his speech at the 75th World Health Assembly ( WHA ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same event , we can also hear Sajid Javid , UK Secretary of State for Health and Social Care , confirming his endorsement of the One Health Agenda discussing Antimicrobial Resistance and Emerging threats , two pillars of the One Health Approach .\nThis can not be a coincidence .\nVideo : Sajid Javid , UK Secretary of State for Health and Social Care on One Health : If you have time do take a moment to check out the stakeholders of the One Health European Join Programme ( OHEJP ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big this Public Private Partnership structure is and what their priorities are .\nThere is no doubt that we are looking at the making of transdisciplinary web of European scientific outfits working with governments who are all too willing to take control of the narrative and associated scientific data and provide more \u2018 recommendations \u2019 for the Global Health Security policymakers .\nThat is the very definition of control .\nThe OHHLEP \u2019 s work is drawing on that of the initiated by French research bodies including , the French National Research Institute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Institut Pasteur the French Agricultural Research Centre for International Development CIRAD , the national research institute for agriculture , food and the environment INRAE ) with various international partners .\nPerhaps that could explain why Macron is so close to Charles Michel the president of the European Council .\nWe can see them below , joining together in a selfie with the French President together with the Arnold \u201c The Terminator \u201d Schwarzenegger .\nThis could easily be interpreted as an insignificant detail , but alas , everything as a meaning .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart of One Health , and more than likely in the planning of \u2018 Pandemic 1\u2032 and certainly the \u2018 Pandemic 2\u2032 ( endearingly referred to by Bill Gates ) which is being touted already by various and sundry experts as some variety of \u2018 pox \u2019 ( perhaps monkeypox or smallpox ) .\nFor it \u2019 s part , will implement the OHHLEP \u2019 s recommendations , combining research and operational activities to mitigate the risk of infectious diseases of animal origin emerging , through reduced pressure on biodiversity .\nOnce more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( transmission of pathogens from wild animals to humans ) is pushed onto the public , forcing us to accept the idea that we are at constant risk from the animal world ( and of course from the environment ) , and that we should be grateful to have Big Pharma and generous philanthropists like Bill Gates coming to the rescue ( it is truly a wonder how humanity has made it this far without them ) .\nThe Prezode Project was announced by World Economic Forum Young leader , French President Emmanuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 January 2021 .\nIt is fascinating to see how this entire puzzle is starting to shape up , even perhaps more interesting to see the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) partnering with PREZODE ( Preventing Zoonotic Disease Emergence ) initiative to build further collaborations to prevent the risk of zoonotic diseases emerging .\n.\nAt this stage , we must ask if the One Health Agenda was included in the blueprint of the World Economic Forum \u2019 s and Klaus Schwab \u2019 s Great Reset master plan .\nLet \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said recently during the 2022 WEF Davos Summit .\nThis short video demonstrates perfectly the level of obedience from the Medical R & D field that has completely assimilated the One Health Approach in their business development strategy .\nYou may have noticed how she avoids mentioning the term One Health , but she does describe it almost to perfection .\nWatch : Is there a reason for that ?\nAbsolutely , scientists receive substantial funding from the US federal government , and the European Union , and major foundations advocating the One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melinda Gates Foundation or the Welcome Trust , just to name a few .\nThis could explain why many of these doctors kept silent during the vaccination roll out in Europe , but also in the US and in the UK .\nOne thing is for sure is that this roster of high-profile doctors are pushing the Globalist One Health Agenda at the many WEF confabs in 2022 .\nI don \u2019 t know about you , but this looks very scripted to me\u2026 \u2018 Threat Based Economy \u2019 \u2013 One Health and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an alliance of 70 countries as well as international and non-government organizations , and private sector companies , working to secure global health security .\nIt includes WHO , OIE , FAO , and also the World Bank and Interpol .\nAccording to GHS , the objectives of the Global Health Security will require not only a \u201c One Health \u201d approach to counter natural disease threats against humans , animals , and the environment , but also a security focus to counter deliberate threats to human , animal , agricultural health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what I call a \u201c Threat Based Economy.\n\u201d Here is an extract of a 2017 interview with Dr Simo Nikkari , GHSA/JEE expert at the Centre for Military Medicine , Finland talking in 2017 about the One Health Concept being at the centre of the Global Health Security Policies .\nThe Joint External Evaluations ( JEE ) is an alliance , but also a tool used by the WHO to obtain independent assessment of countries capacity to comply with the WHO International Health Regulations known as IHR .\nWhat Dr. Nikkari @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is extremely important , as it clearly demonstrates how already , in 2017 , One Health was considered as the foundation for a new framework for public action including animal and human health , but also in agriculture , defense , economic development , food safety planning , public safety planning , tourism , trade and transport .\nWe can now see how it has been designed to cover all aspects of the global economy and society .\nThe One Health Agenda provides the necessary dataset for Global Security Policymakers and the Quadripartite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all sovereign countries right to self-determination .\nIt is crystal clear that unelected body ( private public partnership ) will make the rules for us , if we let them .\nWHO proposed pandemic treaty will strengthen the International Health Regulations ( IHR ) through a One Health Approach as confirmed by the WHO here .\nHere we can see how the global Pandemic Treaty slides perfectly into the One Health framework .\nIt provides the organizational structure and bureaucracy for the Pandemic Treaty , and could form the required cornerstone needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government .\nThis explains why EU policymakers and the European Council are all in favour of a pandemic treaty with the WHO , which could give rise to unimaginable abuse of power and the destruction of democracy as we know it .\nThe United Nations is clearly where the New World Order has encored itself .\nRest assured that this treaty is nothing short but a stepping stone that will empower the new global order and its public private partnership partners in ways and magnitude that has never been seen before .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also \u201c The Primer \u201d for the Great Reset and the structural blueprint for a new economic model , which I will call the \u201c One Economy \u201d .\nThe One Health Approach is fully integrated into a burgeoning \u201c global health security \u201d policy framework \u2013 including global food security policies , global agriculture policies , global environment policies , global transport policies , global defense policies ( etc ) , all encapsulated in the One Health Agenda .\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control ( ECDC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union , the most prominent disease threats related to the One Health concept includes emerging disease vectors ( zoonotic and human origin ) , AMR ( anti-microbial resistance ) , and bioterrorism .\nThe ECDC webpage has already announced an outbreak of monkeypox since early May , currently promoting contact tracing and isolation , but also asking EU countries to review their diagnosis capacity , like PCR Tests , and their Monkeypox vaccine \u2019 s stock .\nNote that bioterrorism , a term often touted by Bill Gates , effectively pulls the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national security and global security .\nAs with the Global War on Terror ( 2001-present ) , any decrees issued under the One Health banner will be classed as \u2018 security measures \u2019 and therefore supersede all normal expectations of civil liberties and rights .\nThis also means that whatever \u2018 The Science \u2019 consensus is at the WHO level , will also be folded into this new global health security matrix .\nAdd to this the prospective WHO Pandemic Treaty , and you then have a situation where there can be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 , becomes a de facto global mandate , and one step close to global government .\nECDC spokesperson Dr. Andrea Ammon on potential monkeypox outbreak in the EU/EEA : Alleged zoonoses pathogens , such as Ebola , Zika , and Avian Influenza , Leishmaniasis , West Nile virus , brucellosis , tularaemia , monkey pox , regular influenza , rabies , hantavirus \u2013 were all identified and highlighted by One Health experts who identified the sectors and/or disciplines that should be prioritised for intensified collaboration with public health .\nThese included : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research , particularly in relation to modeling research involving big data and potentially artificial intelligence for compiling and analysing disparate datasets and historical research .\nThe year 2017 was a pivotal year for the One Health Agenda , with a sudden noticeable acceleration in the project , and we can now observe the results from such efforts in their call for public action to institutionalise One Health , as described in this 2017 expert consultation report entitled , ECDC \u2013 Towards One Health Preparedness .\nRead more\u2026 .\nThe \u201c One Economy \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular call for public action to ensure these economies \u2019 polices and regulations are place under the Quadripartite of WHO-FAO-OIE-UNEP .\nThis will each time result in a \u201c legally binding treaty \u201d which will compel European and other signatory countries to surrender their right of self-determination and the future of their economies ?\nI have already identified few of these calls to action , and here is one of them : \u201c The One Ocean \u201d \u2013 The French President Emmanuel Macron and Ursula Von der Leyen , President of the European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of states and governments respectively , initiated and participated in the launch of the \u201c One Ocean Agenda \u201d at the One Planet Summit for the Ocean , and this is what Ursula had to say : \u201c The Coalition is calling for the adoption of an ambitious treaty for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction .\nWe need an international agreement , a legally binding instrument that would sustainably govern the high seas .\nWe are so close , but we need to push \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the context of global governance , the European Union and the French Presidency of the Council launched the High Ambition Coalition on the High Seas .\nHere the heads of state stressed the urgency of finding an operational agreement by the end of the year .\nWith this in mind , the 27 member states of the European Union and 16 non-EU countries launched the High Ambition Coalition for a \u201c legally binding High Seas Treaty \u201d with the ultimate end goal of the One Ocean Agenda which will likely be placed under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Programme who organised two workshops during the summit , one focusing on the new Blue Economy , and the second on Marine Protected Areas ( MPA ) .\nWe must stay vigilant and examine the contents of these treaties and reject them when the democratic process is undermined .\nOn 7 September 2021 , Rome , the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) part of its Global Action plan on Green Development of Special Agricultural Products launched the One Country One Priority Product ( OCOP ) agenda , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chains of special agricultural products to ensure food security , improve nutrition , increase incomes and preserve the environment .\nThis is what FAO Director-General , QU Dongyu , at the launch event had to say : \u201c The transformation of agri-food systems starts by identifying one product or a specific crop\u2026.This one product then becomes an entry-point for new , concrete actions to achieve tangible results for better production , better nutrition , a better environment and a better life for all , leaving no one behind.\n\u201d On 11th March 2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) launched the new \u2018 One Country One Priority Product \u2019 initiative in Africa , \u201c The transformation of agri-food systems starts by identifying one product or a specific crop , \u201d highlighted the Director-General QU Dongyu .\nThe One Country One Priority Product ( OCOP ) is part of the FAO One Health global action plan to achieve Global Food & Nutrition Security and this plan falls under the FAO one health integrated approach agenda .\nCould Kissinger \u2019 s famous quote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Country One Priority Product ?\n\u201c Control oil , and you control nations ; control food , and you control people \u201d \u2013 Henry Kissinger As you can appreciate , everything tends to link back to the One Health Primer and I believe a global treaty for food & nutrition security is to be expected in a near future where the FAO ( Quadripartite member ) will be the world undisputed authorities for its policies .\nNow tell me this is not about controlling population\u2026 Around the year 2017 , many world leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use and integrate One Health into their Corporate Social Responsibility ( CSR ) strategies and their business development models , many adopting the One Health Concept and embracing the vision that \u2018 our health and that of the planet are totally interdependent.\n\u2019 A great example of such engagement is Danone , one of the world \u2019 s leading food companies , going so far as to revamp their corporate logo by adding a \u201c One Planet One Health \u201d strap line .\nAccording to Danone , this initiative is symbolizing a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Food Revolution .\nIt encourages all consumers and food stakeholders to join the One Planet One Health movement ( read more here ) .\nOther companies such as Veolia , a world leader in ecological transformation , is using its Veolia Foundation to promote the \u201c One Sustainable Health \u201d ( OSH ) approach with the objective to put forward influential recommendations and innovative actions by using the OSHA Forum .\nAccording to the Veolia Foundation , this process will lead to recommendations for public policies and the implementation of operational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c One Health for All \u201d ( back to the primer ) .\nThe recommendations will be at the heart of an OSH Forum statement , which can be adopted at the World Health Summit 2022 ( October 16-18 Berlin , Germany ) .\nAccording to the Partners Foundations of the One Sustainable Health for All ( OSHA ) , such recommendations \u2018 will help guide the public policies and operational programme of states , international agencies , companies , NGOs and foundations.\n\u2019 It is quite clear that global corporations and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and government agencies , have used the COVID-19 pandemic as this new global launch platform \u2013 carving out a window of opportunity for their new initiatives with an integrated One Health Approach .\nOne could say that some of these entities may have benefited from an early warning , but that is for you to decide .\nTo survive in the New Economy , one would need to pledge allegiance to One Health The globalists favoured Public Private Partnership model has created many privileged channels , special forums and lobbying groups \u2013 all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders of yesterday will secure their legacies \u2013 and remain the captains of industry tomorrow .\nStep by step , they will continue to become more and more influential in forming consensus , and will be able to orientate the public policies in ways that benefit them and their privileged cohort .\nThis level of corporate feudalism will eventually plunge the small and medium size enterprises into a disadvantaged position , unable to keep up and afford the rafts of regulations and endless \u2018 compliance \u2019 \u2013 a very unfair competition which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as these already gigantic corporate consortiums continue to own everything ( while you and I will own nothing , and be happy ) .\nIs it a coincidence companies like Mercedez call their new AMG hybrid Project One ?\nIs it a coincidence that global insurance company like Allianz call their new travel insurance OneTrip Emergency Medical ?\nAnd is it a coincidence that Bayer AG , a German multinational pharmaceutical company , is also promoting the One Health Agenda ?\nOur governments around the world were prepared for this COVID 19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UK \u2019 s Jeremy Hunt , Secretary of State for Health and Social Care , launching with prime minister David Cameron in 2015 the UK Vaccine Network , chaired by the infamous Chris Whitty , to ensure that the UK was at the forefront of the global fight against future disease outbreaks .\nThe UK Vaccine Network had already identified that many pathogens of epidemic potential were zoonotic in origin and therefore a One Health Approach was essential to tackle these diseases .\nThe Department of Health and Social Care collaborated then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( BBSRC ) a non-departmental public body principally funded through the Science Budget by the Department of Business , Energy and Industrial Strategy ( BEIS ) , to run a research competition to support One Health Approaches to accelerate vaccine development .\nOne Health is not new for them , it was only kept under the radar until a window of opportunity came knocking at their door .\nThe UK Vaccine network tells you that One Health Research promotes \u2018 antigen discovery , enhance understanding of disease pathogenesis , and accelerate vaccine development.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ is key , how can we forget these supersonic clinical trial and vaccine development , from 10 years to 6 month . )\nI could probably go on for few more pages listing all the corporations , NGO \u2019 s and foundations , as well as governments that have pledged their allegiance to the new One Health world religion , but I would like to think at this stage you \u2019 ve already got the picture .\nIf you are a \u2018 One Health \u2019 true believer , you will no doubt be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more experimental gene therapies , and of course you are prepared to adopt a vegan/vegetarian diet , eschew air travel , not to mention having a wonderful life in your new solar and wind-powered lightly air conditioning smart apartment in your dedicated Smart City , with its beautiful art deco vertical farms .\nHopefully , you will have a view to remind you what you gladly gave up to feel safe .\nIt is absolutely unequivocal that One Health is a pillar of our \u2018 Keepers \u2019 master plan , created to feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scary bulletproof data that will justify any and all new emergency measures , new norms , and new liberticide laws that are vital for stealing what \u2019 s left of our inalienable rights , liberties and freedoms .\nOne Health was not always popular , but slowly it has made its way up to the top of the globalist agenda , and will now play an important role in the new economic model ( Great Reset ) , cleverly crafted by the World Economic Forum and McKinsey & Co. ( one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to innundate the public with the latest \u201c zoonotic spillover \u201d narrative , with the help of the credulous WEF Young Leaders who we have naively elected and of course with the unconditional support of our beloved mainstream media .\nThe globalists are building a virtual economy invoking the following : defense threat emergency , and at any given opportunity , leaving some of us to wonder if the One Health agenda could actually be the operational corner stone , if not the building blocks , of not only the Great Reset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMeanwhile , they are gently collapsing the old economic model with all its dirty secrets , whilst \u2018 Building Back Better \u2019 for themselves , of course .\nWe can now see a controlled demolition exercise in progress , where it \u2019 s better to go along to get along if you don \u2019 t want to be censured , left behind , or simply buried under this new technocratic avalanche .\nThe plan seems to be simple and visibly designed to keep you in a constant state of fear , whilst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilt trips ( similar to the religious concept of original sin ) .\nAre we going to surrender our freedom and human rights for one last dose of their biosafety cocktail ?\nI can not stop thinking that humans might have just become a new commodity , another resource to trade on the market .\nNo more need for quantitative easing , our body will generate billions if not trillions for the banks , the drug and food manufacturer cartels , and the generous philanthropist that have now taken over our countries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy funding has perverted too many of our academics and some in the scientific community , many of who have struggled way too long , waiting for budget that never came , and simply saw a commercial or political opportunity to fulfill their personal ambitions .\nAs for our elected representatives , they are chosen for their ability to not rock boat and for their lack of political courage , so unfortunately there \u2019 s little to no hope there , at least for the immediate present .\nThe new system will make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more predictable consumer with the use of AI , geolocation , facial recognition technologies and machine learning apps .\nThere is a strong case for our bodies to become addicted and dependent from their drugs and vaccines , creating more side effects until our last breath , our last song ( probably Otis Redding , These Arms Of Mine ) .\nThe One Health Coalition end goal is to have vaccines manufacturing facilities in all the countries that are active members of the WHO , and with the looming international agreement ( treaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response , they are getting one step closer to achieving it ( and not without help from Bill Gates ) .\nI am worried that if we keep on entertaining this New World Order lunacy we will end up owning nothing and being very unhappy , and leaving our kids and their kids , to be pricked and manipulated for a very long time to come .\nHowever , I will end this article on a bright note .\nI see undeniable courage every day , as whistle-blowers continue to come forward every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inside .\nThere are still many good and valuable people working for these corrupted institutions and organisations , and in time , more will come forward to confirm what we already know , or at least by then some would have realised what they are actually part of .\nGood work is done everyday in institutes and labs around the world , but we need more transparency and to expose those who see \u2018 dual use \u2019 of science as a limitless commercial concern , or a power-grabbing opportunity .\nRemember your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and remember who you serve when you are a politician , and if you consider yourself to be a citizen of the world , do not take true democracy for granted .\nAlways be reminded that it is an everyday fight just to keep it alive , and therefore it is our duty to actively participate in its preservation .\nIn my next article we will investigate the Monkeypox Mythology and other misconstrued ideas about viruses and associated vaccines in the context of One Health .",

preventing the Russian Foreign Minister from using their airspace \u2013 preventing an important diplomatic trip to Serbia .\nIn reaction , the head of Montenegro \u2019 s parliamentary committee on

Nazis Burned 50,000 Tons of Grain in Mariupol", "content": "MARIUPOL : NATO-backed Nazi militants set fire to grain stores in an attempt to blame Russia for global food shortages .\nAccording to the western establishment narrative being pushed by the mainstream media , United Nations and others , the Ukraine war has stoked a global food crisis , and Russia is to blame .\nHowever , upon closer examination , these claims appear to be false .\nIn the end analysis , the current crisis is most certainly a direct result of a series of deliberate policy decisions made by leading western powers \u2013 most notably , sanctions against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one in the West , or Kiev , is willing to take responsibility for their own role in fomenting the current debacle .\nMeanwhile , in Ukraine , the Zelensky regime and its desperate Nazi foot soldiers have been busy doing their part to exacerbate the crisis , in the hopes that the western media and politicians continue blaming recent events on Moscow .\nThe Russian Defense Ministry has accused Ukrainian \u201c militants of the nationalist battalions \u201d of deliberately setting fire to a large granary in Mariupol \u2019 s sea port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a statement , issued on Wednesday , the alleged act of arson was down to the unwillingness of the \u201c militants \u201d to leave grain supplies to Mariupol \u2019 s residents .\nAs a result , according to the military , more than 50 thousand tons of grain were destroyed .\n\u201c This inhuman crime demonstrates to the entire world community the \u2018 true face \u2019 of the Kiev regime , which , in fact , uses the methods of food terrorism against its own people , \u201d it claimed .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the \u201c so-called civilized West \u201d continues to support Kiev while accusing Russia of stoking a global food crisis .\nThe Defense Ministry stressed that Russian forces during their \u201c special military operation \u201d support the civilian population , treat it humanely and \u201c do not strike at the social infrastructure of the country , unlike the Ukrainian armed formations.\n\u201d Since the launch of the Russian military operation in Ukraine , Moscow

to track where you travel , how you travel , what you eat and any other resources you might use in your day-to-day life .\nThis technology isn \u2019 t commercially available yet , but we \u2019 re

\u2019 t have viable alternatives to diesel-driven machinery used in construction and farming , but they \u2019 re not going to let that stop them from implementing their \u201c green \u201d agenda .\nThey also stressed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it.\n\u201d Worth it for whom ?\nThemselves , of course , because the average person who can \u2019 t afford to drive to work and whose children cry from hunger is hardly going to agree that premature implementation of the green agenda is worth that kind of suffering .\nIt \u2019 s tone-deaf in the extreme , really .\nWatters asks Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul for comment on what \u2019 s happening in Davos , and as noted by Paul , one of the greatest dangers of a One World Government is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Just look at how bad government performs when you \u2019 re allowed to vote for the representatives you actually want , he says .\nThis Davos crowd , which wants and fully intends to form their own global government , doesn \u2019 t represent anyone but themselves .\nYou can \u2019 t vote them in .\nYou can \u2019 t vote them out .\nAnd they \u2019 re accountable to no one .\nLiving in an insulated bubble is also , apparently , hazardous to your intellect .\nAs noted by Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greed , which is dangerously ignorant , and proves they \u2019 re really not qualified to manage anything , let alone a global economy .\nOf course , global economies are not the only thing being destroyed by these billionaire parasites .\nThey also want to be in charge of global health care , and to that end , the World Health Organization is now trying to get member states to agree to a Pandemic Treaty that will give the WHO complete authority over pandemic planning and response , even if its decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It \u2019 s fitting then , that China was recently elected to the WHO \u2019 s executive board.2 Not a single member nation objected to the appointment .\nAs noted by Spectator columnist Ross Clark,3 the election of China is further evidence WHO has \u201c lost all credibility.\n\u201d What \u2019 s more , Clark points out that the only European country on the WHO \u2019 s executive board is Slovakia , which also had one of the highest COVID-19 death rates .\n\u2018 Sustainable Financing \u2019 of the WHO May Be Pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive , as you might imagine , so the World Health Assembly , the governing body for the WHO , has approved a draft decision , A75/9 , which lays out the plan for \u201c sustainable financing \u201d of the WHO .\nAccording to a supporting document titled \u201c A Healthy Return \u2014 Investment Case for a Sustainably Financed WHO , \u201d 4 investing in the WHO \u201c provides a return of at least U.S. $ 35 for every U.S. $ 1 invested.\n\u201d As noted by a Twitter user called Critical Sway,5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on \u201c complex economic calculations \u201d involving \u201c enormous sums of money , projects running worldwide over the next decade , \u201d and factors in \u201c an incalculable number of unknown and unknowable variables.\n\u201d The models for these calculations were done by staff at the Victoria University in Melbourne , Australia , and were funded by the WHO itself .\nIn other words , the return on investment claim could be completely fictitious , especially when you consider that \u201c This lot couldn \u2019 t accurately model one virus over the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 ll use these fantasy calculations to milk governments for more money , and government can then tell the people that their money ( because all government money comes from your tax dollars ) is being \u201c securely invested \u201d and \u201c well spent.\n\u201d In addition to the WHO \u2019 s pandemic treaty , the World Health Assembly recently voted on a set of amendments7 to the International Health Regulations proposed by the Biden administration .\nThese amendments would have stripped member nations of their sovereignty and given the WHO unprecedented power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberties in the name of biosecurity.8 The WHO , however , temporarily withdrew 12 of the 13 proposed amendments , May 25 , 2022 .\nThat doesn \u2019 t mean they \u2019 re off the table , though .\nAnother hearing on these amendments has been scheduled for June 16 and 17 , 2022 .\nAccording to the Liberty Counsel,9 a number of African nations , Iran , Malaysia and Brazil objected to the amendments , for a variety of reasons .\nThe African nations reportedly want the proposed IHR amendments to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being done piecemeal separately .\nSo , we \u2019 re not out of the woods yet .\nWe must continue to pressure the U.S. delegation to the World Health Assembly to oppose these amendments .\nSome nations have expressed support for giving the WHO the power to mandate global universal health care as well , and this is yet another reason to push for national sovereignty and oppose the WHO \u2019 s Pandemic Treaty .\nTake Action Today to Preserve Freedom for Tomorrow !\nAs reported by the Organic Consumers Association:10 \u201c Lockdowns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re imposed by local officials .\nAt least , they can \u2019 t hide from our protests .\nWe can show up where they work and live , and we can vote them out in the next election .\nThings would be much worse if lockdowns and mandates were imposed from Geneva , Switzerland , by an unelected , corporate-controlled bureaucracy \u2026 and that \u2019 s exactly what the pharmaceutical companies are working on now .\nTAKE ACTION !\nTell the U.S. delegation to the World Health Assembly that you oppose their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to the World Council for Health , these amendments would give control over the declaration of a public health emergency in any member state to the WHO Director-General \u2014 even over the objection of the member state \u2026 Under the amendments they \u2019 ve proposed , the U.S. would have just 48-hours to respond to a WHO risk assessment and accept or reject on-site assistance , forcing it to comply or face condemnation from the WHO and , potentially , sanctions from unfriendly nations .\nEven worse than that , under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public health emergency based on secret information from anonymous sources \u2026 Corruption at the WHO was already the \u2018 biggest threat to the world \u2019 s public health of our time \u2019 according to a 2015 investigation.11 We don \u2019 t need U.S. amendments to the International Health Regulations making it any easier for the pharmaceutical companies to wield their influence .\n\u2018 Put simply , the proposed IHR amendments are directed towards establishing a globalist architecture of worldwide health surveillance , reporting , and management , \u2019 says the World Council for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of governance , the public will not have opportunities to provide input or criticism concerning the amendments .\nThis , of course , is a direct violation of the basic tenets of democracy.\n\u2019 The anti-corporate-globalization movement killed the World Trade Organization \u2019 s attempt to establish a global dictatorship where a bureaucracy run by the world \u2019 s largest corporations could override local democracy .\nNow , like the regional trade agreements that replaced the WTO , the World Health Organization is trying to become a mini WTO just for the pharmaceutical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety-testing and regulation of drugs and vaccines\u2013via pandemic Emergency Use Authorizations .\nWe must act now !\n\u201d The World Council for Health has facilitated this process by creating a form letter that you can easily modify if you want .\nYou can find the form letter here .\nOnce you \u2019 ve filled in the blanks and modified it to your liking , the letter will automatically be emailed to the U.S. Health and Human Services of Global Affairs with the push of a button .\nHow to Become Ungovernable While the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear invincible and too powerful to knock down , we should not give in to such mental traps .\nAlways remember that there are literally many millions of us for each and every one of them .\nThey can \u2019 t impose their ambitions on us unless we let them .\nThey need our permission and cooperation to rule over us .\nSo , part of the answer is to become ungovernable .\nI \u2019 m not talking about anarchy , violence or acting \u201c out of control.\n\u201d I mean forming parallel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control grid .\nFor example , a society that primarily relies on physical cash is ungovernable by technocrats because they can \u2019 t track everyone \u2019 s earning and spending .\nA society that refuses to carry geolocation trackers is ungovernable by technocrats because they don \u2019 t know where you are or what you \u2019 re doing .\nThey need all those data points in order to profile you , to create a digital identity of you .\nAnd without that digital identity , artificial intelligence can not predict what you \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respond to a given stimuli .\nThe less data they have on us , the less governable we become .\nIn a May 2 , 2022 , article , Michael Driver highlighted some of the global cabal \u2019 s apparent weaknesses , noting we actually have a lot to be optimistic about .\nHere \u2019 s a longer than usual excerpt from this worthwhile read:13 \u201c I don \u2019 t worry about the World Economic Forum achieving their stated goals for 2030 \u2026 If history rhymes , it positively sings with the failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books are littered with the corpses of centralized top-down ideas .\nThe reason why we are not talking enough about the impossibility of Klaus Schwab \u2019 s Great Leap Forward is because the opposition are guilty of the same failure of basic understanding .\nThe opposition is making the flawed assumption that this project is doable .\nIn fact , the future is resistant to shaping .\nWhat we should all be preparing for is the failure of the WEF \u2019 s program .\nThis should be a cause of profound optimism .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ top-down systemization .\n\u2018 They \u2019 re swimming against the teleological tide of creation \u2014 an impenetrable future

Switzerland busily stitching together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Psalm 59:8 , \u2018 But you , O Lord , shall laugh at them : You shall have all the nations in derision.\n\u2019 Derision and ridicule are the correct responses here , not abject panic .\nThey are not going to succeed ; Iron Mike got it right when he said \u2018 Everyone has a plan till they get punched in the face \u2019 \u2026 Schwab and his collection of command and control technocrats have taken the ideas of Stalin , Chairman Mao , Pol Pot and whoever wrote WeWork \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new clothes .\nThese threadbare robes are camouflaged with words such as \u2018 stewardship , \u2019 which actually means the absence of democracy ; \u2018 sustainability , \u2019 roughly translated as \u2018 you eat bugs while we flamb\u00e9 the wagyu \u2019 ; \u2018 inclusivity , \u2019 which is a big club and you ain \u2019 t in it , and \u2018 equity \u2019 which redistributes assets to billionaires and associated parasites \u2026 Every plan falls apart when you pull on its assumptions .\nThe Great Reset sits on the implicit assumption that everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and controlled via technology .\nSome twisted fantasy they call artificial intelligence .\nA general theory that they claim applies to everyone and everything everywhere .\nGlobalism from above is just another in a long line of narrative fantasies stretching all

traveling long-distance by car .\nWelcome to the nightmare of electric vehicles .\nOne of the explicit goals of the globalists \u2019 Great Reset planetary overhaul is to disincentive individuals and families from traveling long distances by road in the way which combustion engines and affordable hydrocarbon fuels currently allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality and independence for the lives of countless working and middle class people , as well as allowing many regions and countries to develop in ways never before imagined prior to the industrial revolution .\nHowever , elites are now openly stating their desire to end this key aspect of life enjoyed by so many regular working people \u2013 in order to foster a technocratic \u2018 green \u2019 transition , and to supposedly to \u2018 fight

attempts road trip in electric car , ends up spending more time charging than sleeping .\n\u2018 Fumes never smelled so sweet , \u2019 she says upon returning to gas fuel .\nWall Street Journal

infrastructure .\nBy the end of her exhausting trip , she said the fumes of gasoline \u2014 though particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smelled so sweet.\n\u201d Never again .\nWell , at least not for a while , Wolfe would likely say if someone asked her to make a lengthy EV road trip another time .\nIn a column for the newspaper published this month , the reporter chronicled the difficult journey with all of its pitfalls .\nIt included a shorter range than expected , finicky charging cords , loads of slower-than-advertised charging stations , and large swaths of the country without any \u201c fast \u201d charging stations at all , among other hardships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she and her road trip companion , Mack , spent more hours waiting to charge than they did sleeping \u2014 which is not exactly a recipe for a successful and enjoyable trip .\nFrequently , they were forced to make changes to their charted course and pre-planned schedule due to unexpected battery drains along the highway .\n\u201c Factors such as average highway speed , altitude changes , and total cargo weight can all impact range , whether derived from a tank of gasoline or a fully charged battery , \u201d a Kia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missed several reservations thanks to not-so-fast charging stations along their route .\n\u201c It turns out not all \u2018 fast chargers \u2019 live up to the name , \u201d Wolfe remarked in the column .\n\u201c The biggest variable , according to State of Charge , is how many kilowatts a unit can churn out in an hour , \u201d she wrote .\n\u201c To be considered \u2018 fast , \u2019 a charger must be capable of about 24 kW .\nThe fastest chargers can pump out up to 350.\n\u201d Unfortunately for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meridian , Mississippi , only claimed to meet that standard , but in reality had trouble cracking 20kW .\nIt was one of many along the way that took hours more time than anticipated .\nWorse , during lengthy charging waits , EV drivers are often forced to kill time at nearby convenience stores or fast-food restaurants .\nFor Wolfe and Mack , this meant consuming considerably more junk food than advisable .\nPressed for time near the end of their return trip to New Orleans , the duo decided to sleep just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , waking up at 4 a.m. to give themselves plenty of margin should anything go wrong during the last leg .\nGood thing they did .\nThey ended up pulling into their destination with just 30 minutes to spare .\nOn a positive note , the pair spent just $ 175 on charging in comparison to the $ 275 they estimated they would have paid in a similarly-sized gas-fueled vehicle .\nHowever , \u201c That $ 100 savings cost us many hours in waiting time , \u201d Wolfe clarified , adding , \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d It appears that despite the aims of the Biden administration and others , for now , EVs are still best used for saving some money on around-the-town travel \u2014 not cross-country journeys .", "author": "NEWS WIRE", "url":

.\nWhile a few people I saw were suffering from self-created problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or exaggerating their disability for money ( which is the typical lens disability claimants are seen through ) , I

since it removes their motivation to address their illness .\nThis is important because in almost all cases , being disabled and receiving disability is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and having employment .\nI always kept this in mind when I evaluated these claimants , and ultimately recommended disability for many of them .\nI found the majority of claimants I saw did not want to be disabled , had tried

first doctors they met who treated them as a human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a consequence of my working in a socioeconomically impoverished rural area where these patients only had access to the inferior quality of medical care afforded by state medical insurance .\nFrom this job , I came to view the disability process as the last stop on the train for individuals who had been failed by the system .\nDue to the legal requirements of providing an impartial medical evaluation , I was not allowed to provide any type of medical advice to these individuals and I eventually quit the job because it @

is Up to His Old Tricks", "content": "Facing an uncertain presidential election in what was once touted as the pinnacle event of his legacy as uncontested leader of the Turkish republic , Recep Tayyip Erdogan \u2019 s path to reelection is fraught with obstacles .\nThe economic miracle of the first 20 years of his tenure is now a fading memory .\nInflation has soared to 73 % while the Turkish Lira has significantly depreciated in a context which has seen him directly getting involved in replacing economic experts who have challenged Erdogan \u2019 s economic policy choices relating to interest rates .\nIn other words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation in Turkey .\nHaving relinquished control of major cities to the opposition in recent years , Erdogan hopes to stem the tide of discontent by registering wins in foreign policy .\nOne of his latest moves is the culmination of a series of forays in northern Syria by Turkish armed forces \u2013 2016 \u2019 s Euphrates Shield , 2018 \u2019 s Olive Branch , 2019 \u2019 s Peace Spring , and 2020 \u2019 s Spring Shield .\nThe first three allowed Turkey to establish outposts and seize significant control of many key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nearly 900 km border it shares with Syria in the North .\nThe last operation was viewed as a setback which saw Turkey having to cede control of the crucial M4 highway to the Syrian Arab Army as a result of a memorable diplomatic dressing down in Moscow in 2020 .\nThe M4 arterial road connects the industrial centre of Syria in Aleppo City to Damascus .\nQuick to take a leaf out of Washington \u2019 s playbook , Ankara justified his military interventions ( and violations of Syrian sovereignty ) in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( PKK ) .\nErdogan \u2019 s long-standing beef with the Kurds to be sure never stopped him from entering into a somewhat cozy relationship with the notorious Barzani clan in charge of Iraqi Kurdistan .\nThis rapprochement has been very beneficial to both parties .\nWashington has long been siphoning Syrian oil in the northeast of the country into Iraq where it undergoes refining allegedly carried out by a prominent member of the Barzani clan before being shipped into Turkey , seemingly under the watchful eye of Erdogan \u2019 s son-in-law .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oil , Shadowproof \u2019 s Dan Wright noted that Daesh seems \u201c embarrassed \u201d by the reports of oil sales to Israel .\nAl-Araby reported that \u201c someone close to [ Daesh ] \u201d reported via Skype : In Syria , Erdogan has essentially endeavored to forcibly remove all Kurdish presence from areas under Turkish control .\nThis has led to constant clashes with the US-branded Syrian Democratic Forces ( de facto US-managed Kurdish Separatist Contras ) and affiliates while the \u201c international community \u201d has remained silent in the face of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone knows is a war crime .\nA war crime that has also been committed by the Kurdish Contras who have ethnically cleansed much of the North-East they control with the military support of their US handlers .\nLast week , Erdogan made his final move when he gave a speech to his AKP party during which he proclaimed that operations would be under way to secure the return of 1.5 million Syrian refugees into the areas in and around Idlib .\nThe Sultan has long had to face increasing complaints at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is associated with tending to the most basic needs of the estimated 5 million Syrian refugees living in Turkey .\nThis financial burden , while by no means the central cause of Ankara \u2019 s economic woes , is seen by the Sultan as a pivotal issue in the coming Presidential campaign , one that he intends to instrumentalize to secure reelection .\nErdogan calculates that he could come out on top if the 2023 centennial anniversary of the Young Turks Revolution sees him succeed in expanding Turkey \u2019 s sphere of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Syrian territories through the resettlement of refugees who would in turn depend on Ankara for the financing of social services there .\nTo date , it has been announced that Turkey has financed the construction of nearly 150,000 prefabricated housing units in the areas it controls in northern Syria .\nThis project is however likely to meet its own demise before it is even implemented .\nDamascus has perfectly understood the ramifications of Ankara \u2019 s power play and has massed troops to confront the Turkish army in Manbij and Tel Rifaat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strategic M4 highway .\nMoscow for its part is aware that in the event the resettlement project is carried out , its own positions on the Syrian coast will be suddenly very vulnerable .\nLatakia and Tartous are a stone \u2019 s throw away from Al Qaeda-controlled Idlib \u2019 s missile-systems and the perspective of seeing this governorate become a reservoir of recruitment for NATO-member Turkey proxy forces has not escaped Moscow \u2019 s attention .\nIn order to send an extremely clear and unambiguous message to Ankara , the Russian Air-Force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign using the coordinates of Turkish troops in the area under scrutiny .\nIn any future negotiation , Erdogan will presumably want to use Turkey \u2019 s veto power over the admission of Sweden and Finland into NATO in order to extract concessions from Moscow in Syria .\nIt works in Moscow \u2019 s favour that Turkey is blocking the accession to NATO membership for both nations .\nHowever , Moscow increasingly sees the two geopolitical spheres of Ukraine and Syria as components of the same equation .\nAs Russian Foreign Minister , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West has declared total war on us.\n\u201d *** Arnaud Devaley , Center for Geopolitical Studies expert and human rights lawyer currently based in Damascus .",

Verge of Systemic Financial Collapse", "content": "This week , in its bid to stem the tide of inflation , the US Federal Reserve Bank announced its biggest interest rate hike in 25 years , raising the rate three quarters of a percent .\nRelatively speaking , this is like throwing a glass of water on a forest fire , but in the short term it will certainly tighten-up the economy which will trigger

the upper end of the BOJ \u2019 s YCC corridor .\nAs Deutsche Bank \u2019 s George Saravelos shockingly calculates in a post this morning titled \u201c The printer is on overdrive \u201c , and available to professional ZH subscribers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persists , the bank will have bought approximately 10 trillion yen in June .\nTo put that number in context , it is roughly equivalent to the Fed

.\nMore broadly , Saravelos echoes what we said in our preview of the end of MMT , writing that he worries that \u201c the currency and Japanese financial markets are in the process of losing any sort

Julian Assange Has No Prayer Against the \u2018Empire of Lies\u2019", "content": "The Wikileaks co-founder is bound for a show trial by politicians desperate for votes After years on the run from various governments , Wikileaks editor Julian Assange now appears to be heading to the United States , where he can expect to face an election-year show trial built upon a mountain of media-supported lies .\nThis week , the UK Home Office announced , with no small degree of irony , that extraditing Assange to the United States , where he is wanted for his role in leaking thousands of sensitive government documents , would not impinge upon his \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom of expression.\n\u201d That is fresh , considering that it is precisely the question of \u2018 freedom of expression \u2019 that made the Australian-born editor and activist the world \u2019 s most wanted man in the first place .\nIt is hard to calculate what effect Assange \u2019 s extradition , should it occur , will have on press freedoms around the world .\nThe word \u2018 chilling \u2019 comes to mind .\nJulian Assange \u2019 s grand foray onto the world stage occurred in 2010 , when WikiLeaks published close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by US Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning .\nArguably the most devastating batch was The Iraqi War Logs , which represents the biggest military leak in the history of the United States .\nThe records provided irrefutable evidence that American and British officials had deceived the world when they claimed there was no official tallying of civilian deaths in the Iraq war .\nIn a user-friendly dashboard , Wikileaks allowed millions of people to locate 66,081 civilian deaths out of a total of 109,000 fatalities for the period from January 1 , 2004 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the sort of transparency few militaries relish .\nWhile revelations of Iraqi civilian deaths were shocking , they were not necessarily surprising .\nAfter all , by this time the American public had already been introduced to lurid places like Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib , humanitarian no-go zones where the torture and abuse of inmates pulled back the curtain on a sick and twisted side to the military mind few could have imagined .\nMoreover , there was no way for the United States to sweet talk its way out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all to see in black and white .\nWhat is it , then , that has really made Julian Assange America \u2019 s most wanted man , who faces up to 175 years in prison merely for playing messenger ?\nLet \u2019 s not forget that other news media , including The Guardian , New York Times , and Der Spiegel , among many others , also published the damning information , yet it is Assange who faces espionage charges in the United States .\nWhat is the real reason that Julian Assange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2012 at the Ecuadorian embassy in London after Sweden issued a warrant for his arrest over allegations of sexual misconduct that have since been dropped ?\nPerhaps it has more to do with his uncovering of illegitimate activity inside the Democratic Party than any excessive deaths and atrocities on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan ?\nIn the run up to the 2016 presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump , WikiLeaks released a devastating trove of emails either hacked or leaked from Clinton \u2019 s campaign email account .\nThe Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceal the damage by promoting the tale that \u2018 Russian hackers \u2019 had infiltrated the organization \u2019 s computers .\nMeanwhile , the more \u2018 conspiratorial \u2019 explanation is that they were delivered to WikiLeaks via a staff member inside the DNC .\nMore on that later .\nOne consequence of the leaky plumbing , aside from severely damaging Clinton \u2019 s presidential bid , was that it forced DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz to resign .\nIn an embarrassing self-own , the emails showed Democrats working to undermine the campaign of Bernie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an effort to boost Clinton .\nBut the story , at least for the Democrats , gets worse .\nLess than a week before the elections , WikiLeaks released another batch of DNC emails , this time showing that interim DNC Chairwoman Donna Brazile ( a CNN contributor who took over for the disgraced Wasserman Schultz ) had fed questions to the Clinton camp that would be asked during a CNN town hall debate against Trump .\nAs far as \u2018 endangering US democracy \u2019 goes , the Russians had nothing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furious voters were demanding that Clinton forfeit the presidency to Trump before any elections were even held .\nA heavy footnote to this story is how Julian Assange and WikiLeaks got the DNC emails in the first place .\nOn the one side is the story that \u2018 Russian hackers \u2019 had cracked the DNC computers ; on the other side , that an internal source within the DNC passed off the material .\nRegarding the second possibility , just days before the DNC email scandal broke , a DNC manager by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the streets of Washington , DC .\nThis led conspiracy theorists to speculate that the young man might have been the source of the leak .\nRich was murdered on July 10 , while WikiLeaks issued the first of its DNC material on July 22 .\nWhile Assange refused to name the source of the DNC emails , it did not go unnoticed that WikiLeaks posted a $ 20,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the murderer or murderers of Mr. Rich .\nFinally , it is certainly the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in chains along Pennsylvania Avenue in the midst of a tense election year , and at a time when the Democrats desperately need a good distraction from the accumulating bad news , mostly on the economic front .\nAnd as everyone knows , and no one better than Donald J. Trump , nobody is more enthusiastic about hosting show trials than the Democratic Party .\nShould Assange \u2019 s appeal process fail and he be extradited to the US , nobody should be surprised when the mainstream media , loyal to the Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them is a fellow journalist with a duty to call out government malfeasance , seeing him rather as the individual who may have cost Hillary Clinton the throne in 2016 against the loathsome Orange Man .\nJulian Assange can expect no justice in the US , nor even any sympathy , which is why London should never have agreed to extradite him to the Empire of Lies in the first place .\nRobert Bridge is an American writer and journalist .\nHe is the author of \u2018 Midnight in the American Empire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are Destroying the American Dream .\nThis article was originally published at RT.com .", "author": "Wire HQ", "url": "https://21stcenturywire.com/2022/06/20/bridge-julian-assange-has-no-prayer-against-the-empire-of-lies/", "published": "Mon, 20 Jun 2022 16:45:46 +0000", "published_utc": 1655757946, "collection_utc": 1655762408}, {"id": "21stcenturywire--2022-06-22--INTERVIEW: George Eliason talks to Patrick Henningsen about Ukraine, Poland and NATO", "date": "2022-06-22", "source": "21stcenturywire", "title": "INTERVIEW: George Eliason talks to Patrick Henningsen about Ukraine, Poland and NATO", "content": "In this episode of the George Eliason Show which aired on TNT Radio on June 13 , 2022 , guest @ @ @ @ @ 21st Century Wire , discusses the dismal prospects for Ukraine and the western-backed Zelensky regime @ @ @ @ @ NATO and the West may have overplayed their hand on sanctions and by using Ukraine @ @ @ @ @ against Russia .\nListen : \u25b6\ufe0f TUNE-IN LIVE with Patrick Henningsen every TUES & THURS @ @ @ @ @ ) | 1PM-4PM ( LONDON ) | 10PM-1AM ( BRISBANE ) \u2013 LIVE @ TNT @ @ @ @", "author": "NEWS WIRE", "url": "https://21stcenturywire.com/2022/06/22/interview-george-eliason-talks-to-patrick-henningsen-about-ukraine-poland-and-nato/", "published": "Wed, 22 Jun 2022 16:02:47 +0000", "published_utc": 1655928167, "collection_utc": 1655935208}, {"id": "21stcenturywire--2022-06-23--INTERVIEW: Nick Hudson on Economic Shock, Russian Sanctions and COVID Policies", "date": "2022-06-23", "source": "21stcenturywire", "title": "INTERVIEW: Nick Hudson on Economic Shock, Russian Sanctions and COVID Policies", "content": "In Episode #

the States .\nIn 1973 , the Supreme Court legalized abortion under the auspices of the \u201c right of privacy , \u201d which it held to \u201c encompass a woman \u2019 s decision whether or not to

June 28 , 2022 , so there is still time to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by using the Children \u2019 s Health Defense action page , where you can quickly and easily send emails to the FDA , VRBPAC committee , CDC officials and elected representative .\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration amended its EUA for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 shot to allow a booster dose for children ages 5 to 11.23 The FDA \u2019 s \u201c evaluation of safety \u201d for the booster dose in young children was based on a study of only about 400 children , and although that number is exceedingly low , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children in the test for children 6 months to 5 years.24 In a press release , Pfizer announced the EUA they were seeking from the FDA for children 6 months to under 5 years is \u201c based on 10 symptomatic COVID-19 cases identified from seven days after the third dose and accrued as of April 29 , 2022.\n\u201d 25 The study included 1,678 children who received three doses of the formulation .\nHowever , the 80.3 % efficacy that Pfizer announced is based on just 10 cases .\nThe number is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Offit expressed dismay , saying:26 The trial reportedly evaluated \u201c the safety , tolerability and immunogenicity of three doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.\n\u201d 27 This claim of 80.3 % effectiveness in children came on the heels of data released by the New York state Department of Health study28 that showed efficacy in children ages 5 to 11 years fell to 12 % in two months after vaccination .\nThese data are consistent with a report29 from Britain that showed effectiveness against symptomatic infection dropped 22.6 % after two months in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the press release , Pfizer wrote the shot was \u201c well-tolerated among 1,678 children under 5 years of age with a safety profile similar to placebo.\n\u201d 30 However , according to the American Academy of Pediatrics,31 as of June 8 , 2022 , 36 % of 5- to 11-year-olds had received at least one dose and 29 % had received two doses and , according to VAERS , there were 11,773 total reports of adverse events in children 5 to 11 years through June 3 , 2022 .\nIf you extrapolate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pediatric population that received at least one dose , there would be 32,702 adverse events reported in children aged 5 to 11 if 100 % were given the shot .\nIt seems highly unlikely , based on the number of adverse events in children reported to VAERS after at least one injection , that shots in children aged 6 months to under 5 years would have resulted in only \u201c mild or moderate \u201d 32 events , or that the shot could have \u201c a safety profile similar to placebo.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving the push behind getting children vaccinated when there appears to be no scientific reason to do it .\nIn this interview with Alix Mayer , we discuss the nefarious reasons why children are being aggressively targeted .\nEven though VAERS33 has shown many vaccines have a questionable safety profile , data collected from 2021 and 2022 demonstrate the COVID jab presents a more serious risk than all the previous vaccines combined .\nLack of transparency has been a chronic issue within the industry , but the current challenges with the COVID shots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were released under EUA to give the pharmaceutical companies legal immunity against liability for vaccine injury.34 As Mayer points out in the interview , what you may not realize is that although the FDA appeared to approve and license BioNTech \u2019 s Comirnaty,35 the shot is still administered under the EUA .\nOne significant reason is that once the product is fully licensed , the company is liable for injuries.36 For a vaccine and the manufacturer to have immunity that is not administered under an EUA , it must be placed on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mandate the shot ( the federal government only makes recommendations ; states issue the mandates ) .\nMayer notes:39 Will Pediatricians Refuse Care if Parents Refuse the Jab ?\nParental concerns over vaccinations are not a new issue .\nA study40 published in 2005 found \u201c many \u201d pediatricians said they would discontinue care if a family refused vaccination .\nAnother study41,42 published in 2020 surveyed U.S. pediatricians and found 51 % said they would dismiss a family if they refused vaccinations .\nMedical trade associations and several states have also stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under families who want to exercise informed consent on behalf of their children .\nIn 2020,43,44 the District of Columbia passed a allowing minors as young as 11 to consent to a federally-recommendation vaccination without their parents \u2019 consent or knowledge .\nSince then,45 Alabama , Oregon , South Carolina , North Carolina and Rhode Island have passed legislation specifically for the COVID shots .\nThe laws allow doctors to persuade children from 14 to 16 years to take the jab without telling their parents .\nIn May 2022 , California , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young as 12 to get an HPV or hepatitis B vaccination without their parents \u2019 knowledge consent , filed a bill adding the COVID shot to it.46 In his interview with podcaster Joe Rogan,47 Dr. Robert Malone gives a historical perspective on the credentials that make him uniquely qualified to understand and speak about the mRNA technology used in the current COVID-19 genetic jabs .\nRogan \u2019 s podcast is hosted exclusively on Spotify48 but you can see this particular one and read the transcript on the website of Texas Congressman Troy Nehls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spotify app.49 Malone is the primary inventor of the mRNA gene transfer technology that underpins the jab .\nThe very nature of the technology used to create the jab transfers genetic material from the shot into your cells , creating genetic therapy .\nThe information Malone shared during the three-hour interview was so damaging to the COVID narrative that Google manipulated the search results50 and just days before the interview Twitter banned Malone.51", "author": "NEWS WIRE", "url":

their children vaccinated against polio .\n( Like most people , I no longer trust anything that comes from any quango , government advisor , minister or government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things are worth mentioning .\nFirst , polio was officially eradicated in the UK in 2003 .\nSo , why are the authorities still vaccinating children against a disease that was eradicated 19 years ago ?\n( Actually , the last case was in 1984 \u2013 nearly 40 years ago . )\nSecond , the UK HSA suspects that a person vaccinated abroad with the oral polio vaccine ( which contains a live virus ) entered the UK and spread the infection .\nThird , it has been well known for some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result of the Gates \u2019 polio vaccination programme .\nI revealed this nearly two years ago .\nEven .\nThe vaccine used there contains an attenuated or weakened virus .\nThis weak virus is still alive and can cause disease .\n( I suspect that the mainstream media such as the BBC won \u2019 t allow

supplies from our sewage systems .\nWaste sewage ( sometimes treated , sometimes not ) is discharged into rivers .\nActually , it doesn \u2019 t matter whether or not the sewage is treated because the purification programmes can not remove these tiny particles .\nAnd fresh drinking water supplies are then taken out of the rivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n( For more about this take a look at my book Superbody . )\nAnd that , I suspect , is how Bill Gates \u2019 polio has got back into Britain .\nNow that it \u2019 s here , it could be very difficult to get rid of it .\nWas all this accidental

to the top of the charts , as an issue of \u201c deep concern , \u201d I \u2019 m reposting my piece about Al Gore from several years ago : Freeman Dyson , physicist and mathematician , professor emeritus at Princeton \u2019 s Institute for Advanced Study , Fellow of the Royal Society , winner of the Lorentz Medal , the Max Planck Medal , the Fermi Award : \u201c What has happened in the past 10 years is that the discrepancies [ in climate change models ] between what \u2019 s observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much stronger .\nIt \u2019 s clear now the models are wrong , but it wasn \u2019 t so clear 10 years ago\u2026 I \u2019 m 100 per cent Democrat myself , and I like Obama .\nBut he took the wrong side on this [ climate change ] issue , and the Republicans took the right side\u2026 \u201d ( The Register , October 11 , 2015 ) Dr. Ivar Giaever , Nobel-prize winner in Physics ( 1973 ) , reported by Climate Depot , July 8 , 2015 : \u201c Global warming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Excuse me , Mr. President , but you \u2019 re wrong .\nDead wrong.\n\u201d Green Guru James Lovelock , who once predicted imminent destruction of the planet via global warming : \u201c The computer models just weren \u2019 t reliable .\nIn fact , I \u2019 m not sure the whole thing isn \u2019 t crazy , this climate change.\n\u201d ( The Guardian , September 30 , 2016 ) And these are but a tiny fraction of the statements made by dissident scientists who reject manmade global warming .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where leaders have climbed on board the Globalist plan to undermine economies all over the world by grossly lowering energy production , as a way to \u201c reduce warming.\n\u201d One of the major warming hustlers is , of course , Al Gore .\nConsider facts laid out in an uncritical Washington Post story ( October 10 , 2012 , \u201c Al Gore has thrived as a green-tech investor \u201d ) : In 2001 , Al was worth less than $ 2 million .\nBy 2012 , it was estimated he \u2019 d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million .\nHow did he do it ?\nWell , he invested in 14 green companies , who inhaled \u2014 via loans , grants and tax relief \u2014 somewhere in the neighborhood of $ 2.5 billion from the Federal government to go greener .\nTherefore , Gore \u2019 s investments paid off , because the Federal government was providing massive cash backup to those companies .\nIt \u2019 s nice to have Federal friends in high places .\nFor example , Gore \u2019 s investment firm at one point held 4.2 million shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was building 20 wind farms across the United States .\nIberdrola was blessed with $ 1.5 billion from the Federal government for the work which , by its own admission , saved its corporate financial bacon .\nEvery little bit helps .\nThen there was a company called Johnson Controls .\nIt made batteries , including those for electric cars .\nGore \u2019 s investment company , Generation Investment Management ( GIM ) , doubled its holdings in Johnson Controls in 2008 , when shares cost as little $ 9 a share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 to $ 26 .\nNote : Johnson Controls had been bolstered by $ 299 million dropped at its doorstep by the administration of President Barack Obama .\nOn the side , Gore had been giving speeches on the end of life as we know it on planet Earth , for as much as $ 175,000 a pop .\n( It wasn \u2019 t really on the side .\nGore was constantly on the move from conference to conference , spewing jet fumes in his wake . )\nThose lecture fees can add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2012 , had $ 100 million .\nThe man has worked every angle to parlay fear of global-warming catastrophes into a humdinger of a personal fortune .\nAnd he didn \u2019 t achieve his new status in the free market .\nThe Federal government has been helping out with major , major bucks .\nThis wasn \u2019 t an entrepreneur relying exclusively on his own smarts and hard work.Far from it .\n\u2014 How many scientists and other PhDs have been just saying no to the theory of manmade global warming ?\nA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 16 scientists just said no .\nAmong the luminaries : William Happer , professor of physics at Princeton University ; Richard Lindzen , professor of atmospheric sciences at Massachusetts Institute of Technology ; William Kininmonth , former head of climate research at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology .\nAnd then there was the Global Warming Petition Project , or the Oregon Petition , that just said no .\nAccording to Petitionproject.org , the petition has the signatures of \u201c 31,487 American scientists , \u201d of which 9,029 stated they had Ph.D.s .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Globalists \u2019 chief issues .\nManipulating it entails convincing populations that a massive intervention is necessary to stave off the imminent collapse of all life on Earth .\nTherefore , sovereign nations must be eradicated .\nPolitical power and decision-making must flow from above , from \u201c those who are wiser.\n\u201d Al Gore is one of their front men .\nHe jets here and he jets there , carrying their messages .\nHe \u2019 s their delivery kid .\nAnd for his work , he is paid $ 100 million \u2014 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all national governments on the planet to commit to lowering energy production by a significant and destructive percentage in the next 15 years \u2013 \u201c to save us from a horrible fate.\n\u201d Their real agenda is clear : The only solution to climate change is a global energy-management network .\nGlobalist leaders are in the best position to manage such a system .\nThey \u2019 ll mandate FAR LOWER energy-use levels throughout planet Earth

psychologists , etc .\n\u2014 about the value and the importance of gender-affirming care , \u2019 Levine said.\n\u201d \u201c According to the American College of Pediatricians , no single long-term study demonstrates the safety or efficacy of puberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for transgender-believing youth.\n\u201d \u201c Puberty blockers may cause depression and other emotional disturbances related to suicide .\nThe package insert for Lupron , the number one prescribed puberty blocker in America , lists \u2018 emotional instability \u2019 as a side effect and warns prescribers to \u2018 Monitor for development or worsening of psychiatric symptoms during treatment \u2019 .\n\u201d OK .\nThe big takeaway from these statements is : we \u2019 re supposed to believe we \u2019 re talking about a MEDICAL condition and MEDICAL TREATMENT .\nOnce that bell is rung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , the doctor says Jimmy has gender dysphoria , a medical/psychiatric condition , and his desire to transition to a

look from a doctor or a medical bureaucrat , the war is over .\nIt \u2019 s lost .\nThe war against children will be scorched earth and scorched lives .\nI can hear that college educated parent I

around the globe with their poorly conceived and implemented Russian energy sanctions which have backfired spectacularly , allowing Moscow to reap record energy export profits and China and India to buy oil far below spot prices while leaving US motorists paying record prices at the pump , on Sunday the Biden admin alongside the G-7 announced that they will ban Russian gold imports to \u201c further impose financial costs on Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine.\n\u201d The import ban will apply to gold leaving Russia for G-7 countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be codified by the US Treasury Department on Tuesday .\n\u201c The United States has imposed unprecedented costs on Putin to deny him the revenue he needs to fund his war against Ukraine , \u201d Biden tweeted on Sunday , the first day of a G7 meeting in Germany ; a formal announcement is expected later on during the summit .\n\u201c Together , the G7 will announce that we will ban the import of Russian gold , a major export that rakes in tens of billions of dollars for Russia \u201d he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia have largely closed European and US markets to gold from the world \u2019 s second-biggest bullion miner , the G-7 pledge would mark a total severance between Russia and the world \u2019 s top two trading centers , London and New York , largely a purely symbolic escalation .\n\u201c What this does is formalize what the gold industry has already done anyway , \u201d said Adrian Ash , head of research at brokerage BullionVault .\nAs a reminder , back in March the LBMA , or London Bullion Market Association , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list .\nAs a result , shipments between Russia and London have collapsed to almost zero since the invasion of Ukraine .\nFurthermore , an executive order signed by Biden on April 15 explicitly prohibits U.S. persons from engaging in gold-related transactions involving Russia \u2019 s central bank , the country \u2019 s National Wealth Fund or its finance ministry .\nWhile refineries in theory could still import Russian gold directly , most of have sworn off doing so .\nThe association for Swiss refiners , which dominate the industry , denied that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade data indicated the nation \u2019 s bullion had entered the country .\nThe official talking point here , encapsulated by the pro-Biden outlet , The Hill , is that \u201c while it does not bring in as much money as energy , gold is a major source of revenue for the Russian economy .\nRestricting exports to G7 economies will cause more financial strain to Russia as it wages the war in.\n\u201d That , of course , is incorrect : the biggest buyers of gold in recent years have not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Canada , Germany , Japan , the United Kingdom and Italy ) , many of whom naively sold much if not all their gold in the recent past and have refused or simply don \u2019 t have the funds to restock ; instead purchases have all been by developing nation central banks ( like India and Turkey , and of course China which however has a habit of only revealing its true gold inventory every decade or so ) who have been quietly preparing to do what Russia is doing by dedollarizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asset .\nAs for Russia , its central bank has been an aggressive buyer of gold , not seller , and if anything Biden \u2019 s decision will only make the gold market the latest to follow the example of oil and bifurcate : cheaper for Russian-friends and much more expensive for Russian enemies .\nStill , the Hill is right in that the U.S. and its allies have been searching for more and creative ways to punish Russia for the Ukraine war that recently entered its fifth month .\nAnd whereas Biden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allies that range from sanctions on Russian officials and oligarchs to export controls to sanctions on major Russian banks , so far the Russian ruble , which Biden gladly mocked back in February as \u201c rubble \u201d , has since risen to a seven-year high against the euro .\nMeanwhile , Europeans are also limited in what they can do because of their dependence on Russian energy imports .\nEuropean countries have vowed to phase out Russian oil but have not taken steps like the U.S. to do so immediately because they simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think is that while European should be buying more gold to protect the purchasing power of their currencies ahead of the mass printing tsunami that is coming when the next recession begins , they are now voluntarily barring themselves from doing so .\nAs for \u201c punishing \u201d Russia , here is a chart of the US vs Russian current account balance : guess who is at a record surplus and who is at a record deficit .\nBiden administration officials also teased new announcements to squeeze Russia ahead of Biden \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s possible there will be more announcements beyond the plan to ban Russian gold imports .\nWe expect all of them to backfire , especially if Biden decides to also target other Russian metals exports .\nAs a reminder , unlike gold , flows of other metals from Russia such as copper , nickel and palladium have continued uninterrupted as Russia is simply irreplaceable in those supply chains and the commodities industry grapples with managing a long-held relationship with a major supplier of the world \u2019 s raw materials .\nAs for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second-biggest gold mining nation in the world and a major source of supply is cut off from the western market\u2026 \u2026 even if it is still allowed to transact freely with the \u201c rest of the world \u201d which accounts for roughly 80 % of the population , and will most likely simply boost sales to China and the Middle East , both of whom will be happy to continue purchasing Russian gold ?\nWe \u2019 ll find out in a few hours .",

United Nations quadripartite primer for the Fourth Industrial Revolution known as One Health , you may already be cognizant of the next important task \u2013 that of deconstructing the official narrative currently being used to support the climate change doomsday scenarios which globalist institutions claim are somehow impacting global health , and your well-being .\nThis is certainly what climate alarmists would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a crucial anchor for the globalists in gaining adoption for their \u2018 One Health \u2019 command-and-control agenda .\nThe findings in our first article

and natural ecosystems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these principles also resemble something akin to a framework for a fully globalized , socio-economic overhaul .\nIn other words , this is another subtle route for injecting a steady stream of fear and coercion through governments and public-private partnerships and into societies .\nWhen you understand how it actually works , you will soon realise the clever ways in which the globalists are using the One Health agenda to optimise their bottom lines .\nIndeed , all of this elite stewardship of the planet is not undertaken purely out of altruism , @ @ @ @ @

) .\nDuring this chaotic economic and geopolitical transition , we are all busy witnessing magical manifestation of spiraling inflation in the economy , whilst waiting in trepidation for the return of the \u2018 next pandemic \u2019 , be it COVID , or one of its numerous mercurial cousins slated to spring into action whenever the WHO decides to declare a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will examine how and why in the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) and its partners have been relentlessly pushing the idea that \u2018 climate change \u2019 as one of the biggest global health threats to mankind in the 21st

\u201d said Dr Maria Neira , WHO Director of Environment , Climate Change and Health \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made on 11 October 2021 , when the WHO launched its \u201c COP26 Special Report on Climate Change and Health \u201d .\nThe report certainly paved the way for the One Health argument which is being used to bolster \u201c climate action \u201d in the form of a proposal which explicitly lays out a set of priority actions from the global health community to governments and policymakers around the world , calling on them to \u2018 act with urgency \u2019 on what they are alleging is a dual climate and health crisis .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when it comes to climate change alarmists , some of these scientists and politicians associated with this topic have become extremely religious in their tone and rhetoric .\nThe Health Argument for Climate Action : COP26 Special Report on Climate Change and Health : The WHO COP26 report includes ten recommendations that highlight the urgent need and numerous emerging opportunities for governments to prioritise health and equity in the international climate and sustainable development agendas ( forgive them for omitting any mention of the huge profit waiting to be made by these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nWhen you hear crisis terms like \u201c urgent health emergencies , \u201d alarm bells should be going off .\nBy now , everyone who paying attention should know what the word emergency implies , particularly in terms of emergency ( use ) authorisation .\nBy now , you should already know where this path is leading us .\nLet \u2019 s remind ourselves that the WHO had recently changed the definition of a vaccine in order to accommodate a new gene therapy designed to supposedly \u2018 protect \u2019 world populations from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empirical attributes and origins still escape us \u2013 and so pushing climate change as a new global health emergency shouldn \u2019 t be too difficult .\nHowever , even climate change still requires a hook .\nWHO : keeper of the narrative ?\nAccording to a WHO 2016 report entitled , \u201c Preventing disease through healthy environments : a global assessment of the burden of disease from environmental risks , \u201d which attempts to calculate the burden of disease in regions which the WHO deems as potentially catastrophic .\nWHO 2016 report , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a global assessment of the burden of disease from environmental risks \u201d The report claims that low and middle income countries in WHO designated Southeast Asia and Western Pacific Regions had the largest \u2018 environment-related disease burden \u2019 in 2012 , with a total of 7.3 million deaths , most attributable to indoor and outdoor air pollution .\nFurther regional statistics listed in the report include : \u2022 None 847 000 deaths annually in Region of the Americas In 2016 , the WHO began ramping-up its narrative of climate change as a \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noting that the 2015 Lancet

\u2013 while simultaneously naming it as a serious threat .\nThe verbiage seems to matter , as it rings like a WEF Schwabian-style \u2018 window of opportunity \u2019 .\nWhile I wish we could say these are mere recent efforts and not yet well-developed , the fact is that the globalists have been developing this narrative for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the WHO estimated that some 12.6 million deaths ( 23 % of all deaths worldwide ) were attributable to \u2018 modifiable environmental factors \u2019 , many of which are claimed to be influenced by climate change .\nThe 2009 UCL\u2013Lancet Commission : Managing the health effects of climate change , describes the ways in which climate change acts as a \u2018 force multiplier for threats to global health \u2019 , whilst the Rockefeller

than 140 times .\nSo there can be little doubt that the doomsday theory of climate change is being positioned as the central trigger for enacting a centralised global control system under the guise of a global public health initiative .\nReading the Lancet review is enlightening to say the least , and provides us with some explanation as to how globalist confabs are using claims of \u2018 health impacts of climate change \u2019 to underpin their policy prescriptions .\nOne of the tools they use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the World Meteorological Organization , in Geneva , Switzerland ( further down you will see how the US is using the same meteorological approach to justify the health impacts of climate change ) .\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , the United Nations body for assessing the science related to climate change , is perhaps the biggest environmental alarmist oracle of all time .\nNearly all of their predictions and assessments employ elaborate computer modeling , not unlike the complex and alarming models posited by the infamous Imperial College @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used by both the UK and US government to justify a COVID-19 state of emergency and unprecedented \u2018 global public health crisis , \u2019 followed draconian lockdowns , mask mandates , mass testing and tracking of populations , and fanatical vaccine policies .\nSection B.1.4 of their 2022 report entitled , \u201c Climate Change Impacts , Adaptation and Vulnerability Summary for Policymakers \u201d reads as followed : The occurrence of climate-related food-borne and water-borne diseases

increased the occurrence of diarrheal diseases , including cholera ( very high confidence ) and other gastrointestinal infections ( high confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental health challenges are associated with increasing temperatures ( high confidence ) , trauma from weather and climate extreme events ( very high confidence ) , and loss of livelihoods and culture ( high confidence ) .\nIncreased exposure to wildfire smoke , atmospheric dust , and aeroallergen have been associated with climate-sensitive cardiovascular and respiratory distress ( high confidence ) .\nSo is that it ?\nMust we consider all these reports as the actual scientific consensus that supports these sweeping claims and global policy prescriptions ?\nLater in this report , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all of its algorithms and models , was inserted into the equation to explain the global health impacts of climate change , but for now , we \u2019 ll further concentrate on the \u201c One Health Approach \u201d to this alleged environmental crisis .\nA One Health Approach to Climate Change The 2009 UCL-Lancet Commission goes on to state that , \u201c climate change represent the biggest global health threat of the 21st century \u201d .\nAccording to Genon K.

anxieties one needs to develop in order to accept the One Health fear-based economic model .\nNow we understand why more and more children are experiencing \u201c eco-anxiety \u201d , or a chronic fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fostered in part by a sustained barrage of alarmist eschatological sermons delivered by the young climate cleric Greta Thunberg .\nIn Durban , South Africa during the UNFCCC 17th Conference , the world \u2019 s governments took the opportunity to confront all these so-called threats with their supposed stakeholder consensus solutions .\nThe Durban Declaration on Climate and Health was issued December 4 , 2011 , and contributed extensively to the narrative that has been pushed ever since .\nGovernments committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions have issued an immediate \u2018 call for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of climate change , and to protect and advance \u2018 global public health \u2019 .\nThis declaration gave birth to many UN Partnerships & Programmes , all pushing the same climate change and environmental impacts agenda , all carefully wrapped around the idea of \u2018 global public health.\n\u2019 Several global coalitions such as the Health , Environment and Climate Change Coalition ( HECCC ) , and the Climate and Clean Air Coalition ( CCAC ) were created .\nAdditionally , WHO has a joint office with the World Meteorological Organization ( WMO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Convention on Biological Diversity ( CBD ) .\nSee the Durban Declaration here : For its part , the WHO has been diligently working on climate change and global health for over 25 years \u2013 advocating , collecting evidence ( evidence which neither proves nor disproving its claims ) , providing support to countries in dealing with the alleged health effects of climate change , and often falling woefully short of their lofty objectives \u2013 which might explain why the One Health Holistic Approach was adopted so quickly as it provided an invaluable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-fashioned to help support their assumptions and claims .\nThis why the new mantra you are hearing everywhere now is about \u201c preparedness and prevention , \u201d as this does not require anything else but virtual modeling scenarios injecting the right amount of fear and doomsday imagery to further influence and indoctrinate the minds of the public who will be nudged to rally around institutions like the WHO and a One Health Approach to solving these global problems .\nTo this point , we can show a few other key documents amongst affixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps shed some light , or at the very least , help us to better understand \u2013 with a One Health Approach \u2013 the connections between climate change and a potential global health threat .\nNotice also , how all stakeholder institutions have collectively set their virtual alarms for the years 2030 and 2050 , as future watershed markers on the doomsday timeline , implying that their raft of new policies must be in place before those years or else a cataclysmic chain of events will ensue which will then lead to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The World Health Organization .\n( \u200e2014 ) \u200e report on \u201c Quantitative Risk Assessment of the Effects of Climate Change on Selected Causes of Death , 2030s and 2050 \u201d was the reference document used by all stakeholders to establish climate change as a bona fide global health emergency .\nThis quantitative risk assessment study was undertaken by an international consortium coordinated by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine ( LSHTM ) , the University of Otago in New Zealand , and Mariam Otmani del Barrio from the Department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Health at the WHO ( she was responsible for managing the completion of the assessment and the production of the report ) .\nThe study was carried out in order to compare doomsday scenarios with a future without climate change .\nThe results of this study provides us with a projected additional number of deaths for the year 2030 : \u2022 38,000 due to heat exposure in elderly people \u2022 48,000 due to diarrhoea \u2022 60,000 due to malaria , \u2022 95,000 due to childhood under nutrition .\nIn this report , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child mortality , and this is reflected in declining climate change impacts from child malnutrition and diarrheal disease between 2030 and 2050 .\nOn the other hand , by the 2050s , deaths related to heat exposure ( over 100,000 per year ) are projected to increase .\nImpacts are the greatest under a low economic growth scenario because of higher rates of mortality projected in low and middle-income countries .\nBy 2050 , impacts of climate change on mortality are projected to be greatest in South Asia .\nThese results indicate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on child health by the 2030s .\nUnder a base case socio-economic scenario , WHO estimated approximately 250,000 additional deaths due to climate change per year between 2030 and 2050 .\nTo call any of this \u2018 science \u2019 is problematic at best .\nAll of these conclusions seem to be derived from computer modeling based on tenuous assumptions that man-made global warming is somehow driving all of these death categories .\nOf course , these numbers do not represent a prediction of the overall impacts of climate change on health , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important causal pathways .\nNor can they address the fact that many such pathways could also reflect positive , as well as negative impacts on health .\nOn the pandemic side of their argument , their landscape of doom conveniently ignores a fundamental problem .\nEven if any of the following figures are remotely true , which I seriously doubt , it has since been exposed how most people have died with COVID , and not from COVID .\nAdd to this the unreliability of notorious nondiagnostic COVID-19 PCR test assay developed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seriously doubt the baseline figures these projections are working from .\nThe WHO World COVID death toll report 7th June 2022 alleges 6.3 millions deaths from COVID , yet WHO have no problem declaring that climate crisis is one of the most urgent health emergencies we all face with 250,000 additional world deaths due to climate change projected per year between 2030 and 2050 .\nThis type of conflation and hyperbole has sadly become the norm in global public health circles , a veritable free-for-all in terms of spinning up an endless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers simply do not support such exaggerations .\nTheir true purpose seems to be to scare the public .\nWhen using their numbers and applying a strict like-for-like comparison , one could conclude climate change is not in the same league as the tobacco industry whose products are said to kill more than 8 million people each year according to the WHO report from May 2022 , not to mention the measurable environmental effect it has on the planet , and yet the tobacco industry is still quietly carries on in the background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of other more measurable killers .\nWHO : \u2018 Tobacco is killing us and the planet \u2019 campaign : Moreover , their own pronouncements seem to contradict their alarmism .\nThe World Health Organization ( \u200e2014 ) \u200e report on \u201c Quantitative Risk Assessment of the Effects of Climate Change , \u201d points out that recent trends in socio-economic development , education and technology will continue for the next 15\u201350 years , resulting in a continued decline in mortality ( not a rise ) from infectious diseases and undernutrition .\nClearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the narrative , and contravenes the WHO and its partners \u2019 fear mongering campaign which posits that climate change is impacting global public health at an alarming rate .\nSo which is it ?\nAny sober researcher will struggle to see anything alarming in the data .\nNothing here remotely justifies the reforming and streamlining of national and global public health policies , nor a radical and complete overhaul in the way we approach public health in the face of potential pandemics and climate change .\nThe only thing which might explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agenda is perhaps a need to implement world security policies necessary to ballast the construction of a One World Government .\nFor instance , in the context of climate change the One Health approach to vector-borne diseases ( VBD ) is the favored one , which automatically pushes the idea that climate change increases the mortality rate associated with VBD .\nOperationalizing One Health Approach building on the TDR-IDRC Research Initiative on Vector-Borne Diseases in the Context of Climate Change in Africa , is a perfect example of activities sponsored by the WHO/CDC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly a \u201c format \u201d , and a \u201c primer \u201d from which a new globalist language and methodology is being developed to formulate a Strategic Action Plan ( SAP ) to scale-up health and environment interventions in Africa and around the world .\nOf course , all of these actions require solutions which normally arrive in the form of some pharmacuetical intervention .\nNo wonder Big Pharma is sponsoring the 6th World One Health Congress 2020 : A Metrics-Based Evaluation of One Health virtual event .\nTDR is the Special Programme for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a global programme of scientific collaboration claiming to help facilitate , support and influence efforts to combat diseases of poverty .\nIt is co-sponsored by the United Nations Children \u2019 s Fund ( UNICEF ) , the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) , the World Bank and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , all of which are part of the \u201c One Health \u201d syndicate ( think crime syndicate ) in Africa .\nSince the origin of the One Health agenda emanates from the United States , it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partnership which is supposed to stop climate change from destroying \u2018 global health.\n\u2019 As incredible as that sounds , this is actually the fulcrum of this entire technocracy movement .\nIn 2019 , in the United States , more than 70 medical and public health organizations issued a frantic call to action on climate change , calling it the \u201c greatest public health challenge of the 21st century.\n\u201d Notice the keywords : \u2018 public health.\n\u2019 You may ask : what does public health have to do with energy consumption policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the WHO and its stakeholder partners around the world , urging government officials and policymakers to take on a new set of \u2018 public health \u2019 priorities , including shifting away from coal and natural gas to renewable energy , supporting the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions , and ensuring residents have access to safe and affordable drinking water .\nAll of these issues are now being bundled under the broad banner of \u2018 global public health.\n\u2019 Other health impacts all cited in the report a familiar bill of fare : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Lyme disease , and West Nile virus , along with the rise in emergency room visits for various lung conditions including asthma .\nBut then they include other climate-related threats , like the weather , and even an alleged increase in wildfire risks .\nThis leads us to the Washington \u2019 s premier climate consensus gatekeepers , the Climate Program Office ( CPO ) , and their National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA One Health Initiative .\nThe CPO manages competitive research programs , while NOAA funds \u2018 high-priority climate science , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , education , and capacity-building activities designed to advance our understanding of Earth \u2019 s climate system , and to foster the application of this knowledge in risk management and adaptation efforts.\n\u2019 The CPO supports research is conducted in regions across the United States , at national and international level .\nBoth of these organisations are key in producing data which his then used to bolster theories that undergird the opinions of groups like the UN \u2019 s elite IPCC .\nTogether , they form the ring-fence of the \u2018 climate consensus.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s Science Advisory Board \u2019 s Oceans and Health Working Group ( OHWG ) produced a conspicuous report which appears to emphasise the Agency \u2019 s \u2018 contributions to the health community \u2019 and charged the agency with establishing a new coordinated approach across the line offices .\nNot surprisingly , a new \u201c One Health \u201d strategy was launched to address this supposed gap in policy implementation .\nRecently , NOAA has developed new or enhanced partnerships in four key health areas : One Health , public health , climate change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spill .\nNaturally , NOAA has ended up taking the lead in the \u201c One Ocean-One Health \u201d race .\nFor those that read my initial One Health article , you will remember how French President Emmanuel Macron and the president of the European Commission Ursula Von der Leyen , launched the \u201c One Ocean Summit \u201d in Brest , France , in conjunction with the UN Environment Programme ( UNEP ) .\nThere is no doubt that NOAA , a trusted brand among American environmentalists and the liberal establishment , is taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspects of the marine environment to provide forecasts of conditions that could potentially affect human and organism health .\nOnce more , a One Health Model and its associated data will be used to push any number of virtual threats \u2013 which will most certainly be used to justify a legally binding amendment to the High Seas Treaty , likely embedded in a revised UNEP constitution .\nThis will effectively give the globalists \u2019 climate agenda real teeth in terms of what is allowed in trade and commerce in international waters .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which begin beyond national exclusive economic zones that extend 200 nautical miles ( 370 kilometres ) from a country \u2019 s shores .\nHaving said that , the United Nations and their \u201c One Ocean Stakeholder \u201d echelon will find it hard to close this deal \u2013 as they just simply can \u2019 t agree on who gets a share of the benefits from the exploitation of what are known as \u201c marine genetic resources \u201d located all around the world .\nThis may trigger an internecine war among certain elites and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term .\nThis leads us to the issue of Marine Genetic Resources ( MGR ) , which are meant to include the genetic information marine organisms host enabling them to produce a wide range of biochemicals that can benefit humankind in many ways , not least of all through applications of bio discovery of new pharmaceutical compounds , chemical derivatives , cosmetics , food supplements , research tools , and in other industrial processes .\nThey also include adaptive solutions found in deep-sea organisms that can also inspire novel materials and structural designs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry , you can just imagine what a potential financial reservoir the world \u2019 s oceans represent .\nLet \u2019 s think for one second and ask ourselves this : how could the globalists ever hope to have a One World government without controlling the Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction ( ABNJ ) which account for about two-thirds of the world \u2019 s oceans ?\nThe simple answer is : they can \u2019 t , and that is why they are so desperate for a newly revised UN High Seas Treaty .\nAside from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do must also carry a return on investment component , as well as a control component .\nThat is why \u201c One Health \u201d is merely a means to an end .\nHence , the \u201c One Health-One Ocean \u201d can be viewed an adapted methodology for policymakers to leverage the vague and arbitrary threat of climate change as a bona fide \u201c Global Health Emergency.\n\u201d As for us , will be told that due to the omnipresent climate threat , or ubiquitous \u2018 climate chaos , \u2019 access to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources must now be restricted ( you could say privatized for a select few , of course ) in order to protect you from these newly designated \u2018 health hazards \u2019 \u2013 hazards which only became hazards with the stroke of a pen , following some UNSGD Powerpoint presentation .\nAs you have certainly realised by now , it is always about protecting you \u2013 when in reality it is about coercing you into not doing something , or forbidding you from going somewhere .\nThe U.S .\nGlobal Change Research Program ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Congress to coordinate federal research and investments in \u2018 understanding the forces shaping the global environment , both human and natural , and their impacts on society.\n\u2019 In reality , the USGCRP is in the prediction business , supposedly helping public and private stakeholders ( selected for their compliance to the new agenda , membership has its privileges ) identify supposedly \u2018 climate sensitive \u2019 infectious diseases ( EIDs ) , all to supposedly \u2018 protect public health and strengthen national security.\n\u2019 Here we can see their attempt to blend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This will provide the gateway to executive emergency measures .\nThink about what we saw during the COVID-19 era , and now codify this \u2018 global response \u2019 into law .\nCan you see where all of this is heading ?\nOne of their favorite tools in administrating this new technocracy is something called the One Health Systems Mapping and Analysis Resource Toolkit , otherwise known as OH-SMARTTM , and this is how it works : The US 2017 National Security Strategy states that , \u201c biological threats to the U.S. homeland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accident , or a natural outbreak , are growing and require actions to address them at their source.\n\u201d This is why USGCRP has been looking at ways of increasing the U.S. government \u2019 s ability to \u201c predict , and prevent , \u201d and to supposedly prepare for various and sundry \u2018 climate-sensitive \u2019 infectious diseases that the experts claim with somehow threaten U.S. interests at home and abroad , and this also why Atlanticist world leaders are all touting the same mantra , and why the WHO is now working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international legally binding Global Pandemic Treaty .\nThe so-called \u201c War on Terror \u201d has now been replaced by a War on Bio Terror , or more broadly , a \u201c War on an Invisible Enemy.\n\u201d Think about it : no more looking for Bin Laden in the remote mountains of Afghanistan .\nInstead , an A.I .\ndriven One Health Systems Mapping and Analysis Resource Toolkit ( USGCRP ) will do the trick and save us from these endless \u2019 emerging threats \u2019 .\nWhether these threats exist or not is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is how well we as a population will comply with the latest global health diktat de jour .\nIf what I am speaking of still hasn \u2019 t convinced you , then ask yourself why the USGCRP has assembled the proverbial A-Team , regrouping no less than 13 US Gov agencies to control the process ( Yes , 13\u2026 how unlucky we must be ) .\nThe COVID-19 hysteria was merely a primer for things to come .\nThe U.S .\nGlobal Change Research Program \u2019 s 2019 report explains how the federally-funded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on predictive computer modeling ( think Neil Ferguson on steroids ) and its applications for predicting an infinite number alleged risks of \u2018 climate-sensitive emerging infectious diseases.\n\u2019 An interagency steering committee was also created to facilitate \u2018 the flow of information between stakeholders \u2019 \u2013 or more aptly , to ensure the flow of information remains in a sealed vacuum , reserved for those in the need-to-know blackbox big data business .\nOne Health and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) EPA wants to make sure that the United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between climate change and human health .\nThey are positioned to play a key role in facilitating the One Health approach , specifically in administering the supposed emerging risk to human health posed by animal illnesseses .\nWhile this has never really been a problem for humans in the past , the new regime believes this is all of the sudden a major threat , which of course , requires a unitary and globalised \u2018 solution \u2019 .\nEPA is lined up to be a key node in America \u2019 s \u201c One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were selected to organise a series of One Health webinars across the United States in 2021 , mainly promoting the idea that biodiversity and its ecosystems , and posing the question of whether or not mankind could be its own worst enemy , and how man \u2019 s activities might sicken populations and animals , and disrupt ecosystem functions .\nRead more about their ciriculumn here .\nConsider the last two years of intermittent lockdown due to an alleged pandemic , and then ask yourself the following : how effective would a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government wanted to make sure populations were staying home , and fearing everything in their immediate environment \u2013 from their neighbors , to pets , extreme weather events \u2019 , or even the wind blowing something dangerous into their space ?\nWhat about people who then develop mental illness ?\nA One Health Approach would certainly seem to be the state \u2019 s most comprehensive tool at hand .\nPerhaps we should remind ourselves of 9/11 , when the neocons couldn \u2019 t stop promoting the so-called \u201c threat of terrorism \u201d which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its allies heading into Iraq ( thanks to Colin Powell and his imaginary vile of deadly pathogens ) , a supposedly preventative action which cost the western public trillions , and ended up killing at least half a million Iraqis , including countless children \u2013 all based on ZERO evidence .\nEven though Iraq was not involved in the 911 , and certainly didn \u2019 t have a WMD programme .\nAgain , it was all based on the perception of a potential threat .\nNow let \u2019 s imagine for one moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health Concept modeling algorithm .\nWe could be at war with an invisible enemy for the foreseeable future , or a least a few centuries .\nWaves of variants , and new zoonotic diseases .\nNow add to the all pervasive climate threat , and with globalist scions like Madeleine Albright telling you that it too was a difficult choice , but at the end it was all worth it ( for them of course ) .\nWatch : Apparently , there is no time to waste .\nOrganisations such as Global Climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members around the world are promoting the same message over and over , are way too eager to inform us that climate change is already responsible for a rising death toll , and the spread of illness around the world .\nFor this , me must adopt a One Health approach , or we will surely perish .\nTo illustrate this , we can look to the Australia-based Climate and Health Alliance ( CAHA ) , and campaigns like the \u201c Climate Change is a Health Emergency , \u201d another great example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this dubious agenda .\nThe examples are literally everywhere .\nIn Europe , an event called ONE 2022 is promoting the global unitary concept of One Society-One Planet-One Environment-One Life , all tucked neatly under the One Health Agenda .\nYet another effort from the United Nations and its stakeholder partners to promote \u201c One Health \u201d as the primer for the One World Economy , and trust me when I say your health and your well-being is at the very centre of everything , only perhaps not in the way you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe , the French Agency for Development or Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement ( AFD ) , is promoting a new approach to health policies , to better acknowledge the \u2018 interdependence among human and animal health \u2019 , as well as the health of our ecosystems .\nAgain , a \u201c One Health Approach , \u201d for which AFD is already financing several projects .\n\u201c ONE HEALTH \u201d : RESPONDING TO PANDEMICS WITH A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO HUMAN , ANIMAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH In a fantastic article by Michael Shellenberger entitled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are Wrong , \u201d published by Forbes Nov 25 , 2019 , you can read the following : \u2018 Few have underscored the Climate Change and the Environmental Threat more than student climate activist Greta Thunberg and Green New Deal sponsor Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez the later saying : \u2019 \u2018 The world is going to end in 12 years if we don \u2019 t address climate change \u201d Like environmentalist and author Shellenberger , I am not a \u201c climate denier \u201d , but I am conscious enough to know I will likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back against climate alarmism , and for exposing those who have weaponised it to spread fear amongst the populations , in order to expedite a radical political , social and economic agenda , if not their own greed , and desire for money and power .\nIn his article , Shellenberger reminds us that economic development has made us less vulnerable , which is why there was a 99.7 % decline in the death toll from natural disasters ( which would include any climate or weather disasters ) since its peak of casualties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1931 , some 3.7 million people died from natural disasters .\nIn 2018 , just 11,000 died .\nAnd that decline occurred over a period when the global population quadrupled .\nHardly a cause for alarm .\nMore like a cause celebration , but the prophets of doom gathering at confabs like Davos have other plans for humanity .\nWhat about claims of massive crop failures , famine , and mass-death ?\nShellenberger adds : \u201c That \u2019 s science fiction , not science .\nHumans today produce enough food for 10 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need , and scientific bodies predict increases in that share , not declines \u201d He goes on to cite more examples , including figures from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) forecasts for crop yields , showing a steady increase towards 30 % by 2050 .\nAnd the poorest parts of the world , like sub-Saharan Africa , are expected to see increases of 80-90 % .\nAgain , this should be cause for celebration in the 21st century , and yet , we are constantly being told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Michael Shellenberger work in the area of climate change because they worry about the impact this may be having on endangered species .\nMany such environmentalists fear that climate change may even threaten up to one million species globally , and up to half of all mammals , reptiles , and amphibians in diverse places like the Albertine Rift in Central Africa , home to the endangered mountain gorilla .\nThis massive los of in the animal kingdom surely spells doom for humans , no ?\nAgain , Shellenberger concedes , \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we \u2019 re putting the human race survival in danger through extinctions.\n\u201d For a more detailed anlaysis , I will direct you to Michael Shellenberger acclaimed book , \u201c Apocalypse Never \u201d ( Note : I don \u2019 t agree with everything Michaels says , but I have a lot of respect for a man humble enough to recognize he was wrong for a very long time , he was part of the problem and now , perhaps he can be part of the solution ) .\nThe world \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , called climate change \u201c the greatest challenge humans have ever faced \u201d and said it would \u201c wipe out civilizations.\n\u201d It was this kind of emotive propaganda that has paved the way to the new paradigm we are facing now where real environmental concerns have been hijacked by radical climatist doctirines , using any kind of data or computer models to \u2018 prove \u2019 questionable theories that are masqurading as \u2018 settled science.\n\u2019 If I wasn \u2019 t reasonable , I would likely call such an attitude \u201c environmental extremism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under a One Health Approach , these same tropes will be weaponised to scare even more people , and justify the most incredible policy prescriptions \u2013 all in the name of \u2018 global public health.\n\u2019 This is why I found it very hard to believe that our health will , or is being impacted , to the point of calling something as vague and spurious as climate change \u2013 a Global Health Emergency .\nIt simply does not stand up to even the most basic scientific scrutiny .\nFirst climate change was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and now we are meant to believe it could be the cause of most health problems on the planet .\nMerging the threat of climate change with the new concept of global public health .\nBut it \u2019 s really nothing more than the latest globalist parlor trick .\nWe are seriously being taken for a ride , and some people ( we know who they are ) are definitely poised to benefit from this unscrupulous agenda \u2013 an agenda which really needs to be exposed now .\nI will conclude by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effecting the environment happens through a process known as the four seasons ; spring , summer , fall , and winter , and more broadly under solar maximums and minimums .\nDo not read a hint of sarcasm in that statement either .\nSo do not worry yourself too much , and remember that stress is the greatest killer of them all .\nRelax and enjoy your ride listening to Vivaldi , and with time , this wave of One Health and climate change propaganda will soon vanish away like everything that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are genuinely concerned about the fate of the planet , then consider getting yourself a bicycle , it will provide you with the exercise you need , whilst getting you off your computer and allow you to admire nature without polluting .\nIn our next article , we will likely address One Health and the Global Food

vote based on the girth of their wallets , and nothing drains the purchasing power of the people quite like 10 % inflation .\nHence , the Democrats are facing an electoral nuclear meltdown this fall .\nThe question now is : will it get worse before it gets better ?\nPolitical circus acts like the \u201c January 6th Hearings \u201d , and other distractions can not conceal the gaping wound in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spike and inflation anxiety has almost guaranteed that the White House will remain in damage control mode for the foreseeable future .\nSo far , all of the White House \u2019 s actions meant to cool off energy prices have failed miserably \u2013 including releasing oil from the nation \u2019 s strategic petroleum reserves , and imposing a \u201c gas tax holiday \u201d meant to ease process at the pump .\n$ 5 per gallon is now the norm , and it \u2019 s even higher in California and other coastal price-gouging zones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now bracing for insane heating bills this winter , with natural gas costs skyrocketing to more than double where they were in 2021 .\nNow for a look inside the real war room\u2026 While the Biden administration is hoping and praying that someone \u2013 anyone \u2013 will watch the comical \u201c Jan 6 \u201d kangaroo hearsay court taking place in Congress and meant to somehow block Trump from running for president in 2024 while also making hundreds of millions of Americans forget that the current administration could very well be the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparing for the worst .\nAs none other than pro-Biden propaganda spinmaster CNN reports , when it comes to what really matters ( at least according to Gallup ) , namely the economy , and specifically galloping gasoline prices , the White House is in a historic shambles .\nThe suspects behind the historic implosion are well known : \u201c soaring prices , teetering poll numbers and congressional majorities that appear to be on the brink have created no shortage of reasons for unease .\nGas prices are hovering at or around $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and billboards across the country as a symbolic daily reminder of the reality \u2014 one in which White House officials are extremely aware \u2014 that the country \u2019 s view of the economy is growing darker and taking Biden \u2019 s political future with it.\n\u201d \u201c You don \u2019 t have to be a very sophisticated person to know how lines of presidential approval and gas prices go historically in the United States , \u201d a senior White House official told CNN .\nA CNN Poll of Polls average of ratings for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds that 39 % of Americans approve of the job he \u2019 s doing .\nHis numbers on the economy , gas prices and inflation specifically are even worse in recent polls .\nWhat CNN won \u2019 t tell you is that Biden is now polling well below Trump at this time in his tenure .\nThe CNN article then goes into a lengthy analysis of what is behind the current gasoline crisis ( those with lots of time to kill can read it here ) and also tries to explains , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing that can fix the problem is more supply , but \u2013 as we first explained \u2013 this can \u2019 t and won \u2019 t happen because green fanatics and socialist environmentalists will never agree to boosting output .\nWhich brings us to the punchline : as CNN \u2019 s Phil Mattingly writes , \u201c instead of managing an economy in the midst of a natural rotation away from recovery and into a stable period of growth , economic officials are analyzing and modeling worst-case scenarios like what the shock of gas prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the economy .\n\u201d Well , in an article titled \u201c Give us a plan or give us someone to blame \u201c , this seems like both a plan , and someone to blame .\nBut unfortunately for Biden \u2013 and CNN which is hoping to reset expectations \u2013 it \u2019 s only going to get worse , because as we noted moments ago , while nobody was paying attention , Cushing inventories dropped to just 1 million away from operational bottoms at roughly 20MM barrels .\nThis means that the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But wait , there \u2019 s more\u2026 or rather , it \u2019 s even worse , because as even Bloomberg \u2019 s chief energy guru Javier Blas notes , over the last 2 weeks , the US gov has drained 13.7 million barrels from the SPR , \u201c and yet , commercial oil stockpiles still fell 3 million barrels over the period.\n\u201d Just imagine , Blas asks rhetorically , \u201c if the SPR wasn \u2019 t there .\nOr what would happen post-Oct when sales end.\n\u201d OIL MARKET : Over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has injected 13.7 million barrels from the SPR into the market .\nAnd yet , commercial oil stockpiles still fell 3 million barrels over the period .\nJust imagine if the SPR was n't there .\nOr what would happen post-Oct when sales end # OOTT And here is the punchline : at the current record pace of SPR drainage , one way or another the Biden admin will have to end its artificial attempts to keep the price of oil lower some time in October ( or risk entering a war with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserve ) .\nThis means that unless Putin ends his war some time in the next 5 months , there is a non-trivial chance that oil will hit a record price around $ 200 \u2013 precisely the price the White House is bracing for \u2013 a few days before the midterms .\nWhile translates into $ 10+ gasoline .\nAnd while one can speculate how much longer Democrats can continue the \u201c Jan 6 \u201d dog and pony show as the entire economy implodes around them , how America will vote in November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a mystery to anyone .\nREAD MORE FINANCIAL NEWS AT : 21st Century Wire Financial Files Clive de Carle 's Natural Health essentials of the finest quality ,

@ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Democratic Republic of Congo \u2014 two years after the country officially declared its last case of smallpox and just months before the United States Public Health Service

outbreak , the U.K. government is offering smallpox vaccines to \u2018 higher risk \u2019 contacts ( who also happen to be the most vulnerable to adverse reactions ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this report by CBS News , the smallpox vaccination sounds very much like a toxic deadly weapon , while other information ( from the FDA ) states that Imvanex ( aka Jynneox ) has still not been assessed for mutagenicity , carcinogenicity , or male reproductive impairment .\nThis raises an obvious question of safety : could off-label use of a potentially dangerous vaccine inadvertently turn an unpleasant ( but mostly harmless ) skin rash into something far worse ?\nAccording to this UK government document , the smallpox vaccine ( now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine \u2019 ) was \u2018 used in the UK in response to previous incidents \u2019 .\nThere are numerous reports of \u2018 generalised vaccinia \u2019 and eczema vaccinatum after smallpox vaccination \u2014 the symptoms of which look and sound very much like smallpox .\nRather worryingly , cases of smallpox rose after vaccination .\nIf that is the case , then health and medical officials would be in their rights to ask : do we really want to poke a sleeping beast ?\nBeyond this , a further question could also be asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recipients are in fact experiencing an adverse reaction .\nWhat if the pox is vaccine-induced ?\nThere are verified reports of horrific skin conditions ( see the following three scientific papers , 1 , 2 , 3 ) , as well as reports of shingles \u2013 all following covid-19 vaccination ( along with myriad other complications ) , yet the jabs roll on\u2026 Cases of vaccine-induced illnesses are not new .\nImmune thrombocytopenic purpura appeared after the measles-mumps-rubella ( MMR ) vaccine ; encephalitis

damage inflicted was immediate and lasting .\nMore recently , a 2008 study linked the US military \u2019 s mass vaccination practices to the epidemic of Gulf War Syndrome .\nThere findings were compelling , and may provide a more plausible explanation for this tragic disease suffered by so many US service personnel .\nOther cases point to similar conclusions .\nMilitary vaccinations caused 50,000 cases of hepatitis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veterans claimed they contracted hepatitis C through compulsory shots .\nIn January this year , the Rio Times published a study linking covid mRNA jabs to hepatitis , and in April \u2018 acute hepatitis of unknown aetiology \u2019 appeared in children in Scotland .\nThat same month the U.K. government acknowledged an increase in hepatitis in children ,

polio , as well as other conditions too .\nGBS was first known as Landry \u2019 s Ascending Paralysis , which was considered a type of polio by physicians in the early 1900s .\nIt became known by its current name in 1916 after Guillain , Barr\u00e9 , and Strohl conducted extensive studies on soldiers with peripheral neuropathy in WWI .\nStudies link GBS with vaccines for rabies , hepatitis A and B

regain power over them and sent Avakov to resign .\nBut the problem has not been eliminated , as Avakov \u2019 s loyalists continue to remain in power , and the paramilitary forces informally controlled by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s main strike and defence forces .\nWith the outbreak of the war , Avakov \u2019 s resources have significantly increased .\nHis units are fighting against

better sewage facilities , better housing and better food mean that today it is uncommon for babies to die .\nThe infant mortality rate has improved dramatically .\nAnd this has had a dramatic effect on average life expectancy .\nIf one baby in 100 dies just after birth , and the other 99 live to be 80 then the average life expectancy is close to 80 years .\nThis statistical anomaly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishment , to claim that they are responsible for improving life expectancy \u2013 and deserve massive amounts of applause .\nThe truth is that the change in life expectancy is almost entirely due , as I said earlier , to cleaner drinking water , better sewage facilities , better housing and better food .\nVery few major improvements have been made by medical science .\nThe biggest development was the serendipitous discovery of antibiotics nearly a century ago .\nAnd the advantage antibiotics gave us over infections has been squandered by absurd overprescribing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to most or all of their cattle .\nThese disastrous errors have led to the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria .\nDrug companies and doctors have had virtually no impact on life expectation .\nIndeed , it is possible to argue that , on balance , they have done more harm than good .\nCertainly , thirty years ago I produced clear evidence that doctors are one of the three biggest killers \u2013 alongside cancer and circulatory disease .\nBut the medical establishment , and journalists bought by the pharmaceutical industry , continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suggesting that they and they alone are responsible for improving life expectation .\nNaturally , they refuse to debate the myth because they know they will lose the debate .\nThis article was originally published at Vernon Coleman

23 Secret Proxy Wars Since 2017", "content": "The history of Washington \u2019 s covert overseas operations goes way back , even before the Cold War , with numerous operations being conducted before and during both World Wars .\nThe purpose of these \u2018 shadow wars \u2019 was normally the same : to destabilize any unfriendly governments and install a new regime with which Washington could \u2018 do business with.\n\u2019 Unless you read certain international publications , you would hardly hear about any of these proxy wars , although in some rare cases such covert operations could eventually escalate into a full-blown conflict .\nBack in 2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the deployment of US Special Operations forces had become a growing form of overseas power projection .\nThe report revealed that in the year 2013 under President Barack Obama , elite US forces were deployed in 134 countries around the globe , according to Major Matthew Robert Bockholt of SOCOM Public Affairs .\nOf course , in historical terms , this is only the tip of a much larger iceberg which stretches back a century , some of which has been well documented by the National Security Archive .\nMore recently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a secret directive used to launch at least two dozen such proxy wars across the globe\u2026 The US has reportedly used a secretive authority called \u2018 127e \u2019 to launch at least two dozen proxy wars since 2017 , according to an article published on Friday by The Intercept .\nThe outlet claims to have obtained never-before-seen documents and spoken to top officials with intimate knowledge of these programs .\nThe Intercept received the documents through the Freedom of Information Act , claiming these papers are the first ever official confirmation that at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were active in the greater Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions as recently as 2020 .\nIn total , the Pentagon reportedly launched 23 separate 127e programs across the globe between 2017 and 2020 , which cost US taxpayers $ 310 million .\nThe Intercept explains that 127e is one of several virtually unknown authorities granted to the Defense Department by Congress over the last two decades .\nIt authorizes US commandos to conduct \u201c counterterrorism operations \u201d in cooperation with foreign and irregular partner forces around the world with minimal outside oversight .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , train , and provide intelligence to foreign forces .\nHowever , unlike traditional foreign assistance programs , which focus on building up local capacity in partner countries , 127e \u201c surrogate forces \u201d are expected to follow US orders and conduct Washington-directed missions against US enemies to achieve US goals , essentially serving as the Pentagon \u2019 s proxy armies .\nAccording to the outlet , almost no information about these operations is ever shared with any members of Congress or State Department officials .\nIt is generally unknown where these operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or even the identity of the foreign forces the US cooperates with to carry them out .\nCritics of the programs warn that they could lead to unanticipated military escalation and engage the US in over a dozen conflicts around the world , since 127e does not allow for any oversight or input from foreign affairs officials .\nThe outlet notes that although the latest batch of documents sheds more light on the 127e program , it still remains mostly unknown to both the public and members of Congress , who almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program .\nA government official familiar with the program , who requested anonymity to discuss it , told The Intercept that most congressional staffers don \u2019 t even have the clearance to view 127e reports , and those who do rarely ask for them .\n\u201c It

is a major blow to the Zelensky regime , but it will be even more devastating for the geographically-challenged boffins in Washington and London , who are still determined to paint every resounding defeat for Kiev as a \u2018 strategic pause \u2019 .\nOver the weekend , Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu spoke to President Vladimir Putin , informing the leader that Luhansk region has been \u201c liberated.\n\u201d Yes , that means all of Luhansk .\nThis is true game changer on many fronts .\nFirstly , it brings Russia one step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategical objectives : securing the administrative borders of the newly independent Donetsk People \u2019 s Republic ( DPR ) , and Luhansk People \u2019 s Republic ( LPR ) .\nMilitarily , the significance of this is self-evident \u2013 breaking a protracted stalemate which saw many thousands killed and maimed in an eight-year long civil war between residents and Kiev \u2019 s radical nationalist battalions .\nWestern politicos and punditry can invoke \u2018 international law \u2019 ad nauseam , but the path ahead for Russia and its allies is now clear ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regions will ballast any future negotiations , especially in regard to any aspirations for statehood , or in holding a referendum to join the Russian Federation .\nThis shouldn \u2019 t come as any surprise to those observers who \u2019 ve been actually following the daily bulletins and reports coming out of Moscow , along with a number of Russian bloggers and Telegram channels which have established a near unblemished record in terms of accuracy since this conflict began .\nStill , despite all this , spinmeisters in Kiev have not yet confirmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Luhansk .\nIn the last 48 hours , the shuddering propaganda shop in Kiev ( much of their \u2018 information operations \u2019 are being micromanaged by Uncle Sam \u2019 s Disinfo HQ in Stuttgart and Langley ) has been busy throwing up sunbursts claiming that Russia is actually losing in the town of Lysychansk .\nIt \u2019 s almost surreal seeing the stark difference in coverage between the two sides in this conflict .\nYou can almost hear the infighting going on behind the scenes between Kiev \u2019 s version of Terry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Michael Palin and Jonathan Pryce , arguing between the departments of \u2018 information retrieval \u2019 and \u2018 information dispersal.\n\u2019 Lost amid the reams of cables and \u2018 intel \u2019 .\nSo much Intel knocking around at the moment , especially on US cable news .\nIMAGE : Relax says the BBC , \u2018 Do not listen to the Kremlin \u2013 we \u2019 re winning !\n\u2019 Putting aside for a moment President Zelensky \u2019 s daily celebrity photo-ops , it \u2019 s become apparent that Kiev \u2019 s information operations have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see it , except for hopelessly loyal western media operatives who still hang on their every word .\nHence , western MSM reporting will remain 48 to 72 hours late on pretty much everything .\nSo Allied forces of Russia , DPR , and LPR have taken control of the entire Luhansk region , in what is fast becoming former eastern Ukraine ( as painful as that may sound , it \u2019 s true ) .\nThis key milestone was declared after capturing the final Armed Forces of Ukraine ( AFU ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c After successful military operations , Russian forces and the Luhansk People \u2019 s Militia established full control over the city of Lysychansk and a number of nearby settlements , \u201d said Shoigu .\nThe other reason this is a game changer is that Allied forces can now shift their battlefield focus to the neighbouring Donetsk region , making the encirclement of any remaining entrenched AFU positions a practical fait accompli .\nThis also means that Kiev \u2019 s tenuous hold over Kharkov , Ukraine \u2019 s second-largest city , is now in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is largely a Russian city , although currently controlled by radical Ukrainian nationalist military units .\nHowever , as soon as residents there sense that their city is becoming a focal point of the conflict , you could see a rejection of radical militants \u2019 governing authority in much the same way that the people in Mariupol began rejecting the Nazi Azov battalion occupation of that city , resulting in a pitch battle between Ukrainian militants and a vastly superior Russian-led coalition .\nIt \u2019 s just a question of time now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , but which a flagging regime in Kiev and its NATO controllers unfortunately do not .\nBy now , it would be hard not to underscore what an epic failure the western propaganda effort has been .\nIt \u2019 s becoming embarrassing to watch , and it comes with some very real consequences .\nWhile it \u2019 s understandable why a US-UK dominated NATO would want to brainwash its own populations about how \u2018 the war \u2019 is going ( that \u2019 s what governments normally do anyway , especially

overly optimistic and completely false reporting , both of which is further contorting the West \u2019 s military , economic and political positions , not to mention Ukraine \u2019 s own @ @ @ @ @ @ @

mainstream press and government do incessantly .\nThe reality is something completely different : Russia \u2019 s initial feint of encircling Kiev early on effectively tied most of Ukraine \u2019 s primary military forces which were moved to fortify the capital while Russian and DPR forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the country , including the port city of Mariupol , and begun the encirclement of AFU divisions in Donbass .\nAfter pulling back from Kiev , the Allied forces have systematically routed NATO-backed AFU regiments in what looks like one of the most decisive military movements of the modern era .\nYou can see the results of this by looking at any of the up-to-date battle maps .\nThat \u2019 s the reality of the situation , and no amount of creative wordsmithing by the battery of professional propagandists embedded in western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to wonder though : do western journalists and the legion of TV \u2018 military experts \u2019 even read the daily Russian battle maps ?\nJudging by the lack of quality and accuracy in western reportage and punditry , it doesn \u2019 t seem like they do .\nBut who really knows .\nPerhaps they \u2019 re afraid of succumbing to the

from their airwaves and ISPs .\nWe \u2019 re told this is because we need to protect vulnerable western minds from undue influence abroad .\nIndeed , any student of history will tell you that at various junctures in history , depending on which side of the iron curtain you find yourself on , facts can be very dangerous .\nWhen it comes to geopolitical commentary , this shouldn \u2019 t be a

altruistic Western sponsors to transfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems ( MANPADS ) , but also some western interceptor F-15E and F16 fighters to Ukraine .\nIn the last four months , so many Western weapons have made their way into the war zone , but none have been more talked about than the recent supply of multiple-launch rocket systems ( MLRS ) , a medium to long-range launcher , including Britain

counter Russia \u2019 s apparent advantage when it comes to artillery firepower .\nAs expected , the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense did not miss the opportunity to promote its newly acquired toys on

Systems which were also transferred to Ukraine .\nCAESAR : What happened to them , and where are they ?\nOn April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered the conflict zone after French President Emmanuel Macron announced the gift of the artillery systems to Ukraine , as well as the arrival of 40 Ukrainian military personnel to train on them in France .\nBuilt by France \u2019 s partly state-owned arms maker Nexter , the CAESAR system is a 155mm howitzer mounted on a six-wheeled truck chassis , capable of firing shells at ranges of more than 40 kilometers ( 25 miles ) .\nFirst let \u2019 s take a look at the CAESAR in action in the Donbass\u2026 During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CAESAR system in Ukraine , Rybar Telegram channel which has been consistent and largely accurate in its military reporting so far , corroborated rumors that had been circulating for several days \u2013 confirming that two French CAESAR systems which had been previously shipped from Paris to Ukraine have since been resold by the latter , and eventually shipped to Russia , where they are now likely being studied and deconstructed by Russian military engineers , and who knows what else ( they could even be spun-off into a new-improved product line ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French lawyer R\u00e9gis de Castelnau posted on Twitter an announcement that Russia had in fact acquired these two French CAESAR systems , in perfect condition , which were intended for Ukraine .\nThe information seemed too broad at first , and was not fully confirmed until June 23 , when a Russian firm Uralvagonzavod replied to R\u00e9gis de Castelnau \u2019 s tweet on the French lawyer \u2019 s Telegram channel .\nUralvagonzavod \u2019 s reply to R\u00e9gis de Castelnau \u2019 s tweet translates as followed : Of course , the sarcastic tone of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comments made by the Donbass Insider , who were still hesitant to confirm the information until June 29th when they could receive joint confirmation of the facts from not only Rybar , but also from French military sources .\nIn their latest article on the subject , the Donbass Insider unpacked Rybar \u2019 s telegram post which explains how Russia acquired two French CAESAR self-propelled artillery systems destined for Ukraine .\nAs it turns out , of all the CAESAR guns shipped to Kyiv , not all of the 14 CAESAR units made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIndeed , three CAESAR artillery systems seemed to have been destroyed in the airstrike on Kurakhovo , and another was destroyed in the Kubansky Peninsula in the Odessa region .\nStill , undoubtedly the most shocking revelation was that two CAESAR were sold for $ 120,000 each , a ridiculous price you might say considering that these self-propelled gun units are worth about 7 million euros each .\nSo two CAESAR self-propelled guns , estimated at 14 million euros , were resold by the Ukrainians to the Russians for $ 240,000 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ when finding out their money is being wasted in such a ridiculous fashion .\nRybar , rightly so , reminded us how sending the CAESAR self-propelled guns to Ukraine was a form of madness , not least of all because the artillery systems France handed over to Kyiv were partially intended for Morocco under state contracts , adding that some were even removed from combat duty .\nWe also learn in his post that the supply of these CAESAR self-propelled guns actually deprived several French units of their key artillery systems , suggesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one CAESAR to show for .\nThere seems to be no end to NATO folly in Ukraine .\nBy depleting our own armed forces in Europe to support a conflict that is partly due to the sabotage of the Minsk Peace Agreement of which French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande ( and Macron after him ) himself ignored all the tools and instruments at his fingertips which could have forced the Ukrainian government to comply with the said agreement , not to mention the Ukrainian authorities constant negative approach to pursuing a peaceful resolution to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donbass \u2013 makes this latest arms trafficking scandal very hard to swallow .\nThat said , it is not hard to understand that , if indeed the CAESAR did end up in the hands of the Russian military , the fire guidance and coordination system will definitely be of interest and likely retro-engineered by of one of Russia \u2019 s top scientific and military industry labs .\nBravo Macron !\nShould anyone be surprised by the fact that Ukrainian officers are selling western arms on the black market ?\nApparently not , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Levy also says that he believes the two self-propelled howitzers were resold with the help of an intermediary , a military dealer .\nLevy , however , has no evidence for his claims but refers to his league reasoning .\nThe feeling that corrupt Ukrainian servicemen are involved in the illegal arms trade to extract maximum profit is not from now , and it is not only about this case .\nOn June 2 , BulgarianMilitary.com revealed the sale of at least one FGM-148 Javelin anti-tank guided missile system on the dark web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unclear , but according to the information posted on the darknet , the location [ where the system will be shipped or picked up from ] is Kyiv , the capital of Ukraine .\n\u201c Ukrops are selling Javelins on the darknet .\nThe command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine resells equipment and weapons supplied by NATO to the Middle East and North Africa .\nAnyone with a TOR browser can buy this ATGM in the online store , \u201d writes the pro-Russian Telegram channel ABS News .\nOh , and Interpol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West is now undermining international law I would also like to direct readers to one of our recent articles entitled , \u201c Are France and NATO Shipping Depleted Uranium Weaponry Into Ukraine ?\n\u201d \u2013 where we exposed the very controversial use of depleted uranium munitions and shells in war theaters , including the ones now taking place in urban areas of this Ukraine conflict .\nOur research strongly suggests that depleted uranium material may be present within the CAESAR system , although it is not yet explicitly confirmed in the public domain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt \u2019 s clear that aside from its destabilising potential for Europe and Eurasia , this latest multilateral proxy war experiment by NATO has the potential to completely undermine international law structures , and the question then remains : \u201c Can France and the countries that supply arms to Ukraine be considered co-belligerents ?\n\u201d On Wednesday , March 2 , 2022 , President Emmanuel Macron in a recent televised address made a point of clarifying France \u2019 s position on the military offensive led by Moscow in Ukraine from February 24th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put this into a contemporary context : \u201c The term co-belligerents does not exist in international law , since 1977 , the year of the two Protocols additional to the 1949 Geneva Conventions for the protection of victims of armed conflict , the term \u201c party to the conflict \u201d has been used in preference .\n\u201c In general , to fight a war , you have to send combat troops , \u201d concludes Julien Th\u00e9ron , a researcher at the French Institute of Technology and an expert on conflict and international security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that during the Ukrainian conflict .\nUnder international law , it is not at war with Russia at all.\n\u201d ( Source : France Info ) Now , of course that statement is correct in principle , but the question of perception is sometimes as important as the law itself , and so it is now for the nations , and each individual therein , to decide for themselves whether their countries procuring lethal weapons and sending them into a televised conflict at the border of Europe , supposedly in order to \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptable approach to securing peace and stability in the region .\nIf you are supporting \u2018 peace at all cost \u2019 , then surely this current situation should not sit well with you .\nHow many more Ukrainian people , and particularly those tens of thousands of men ( and some women too ) conscripted into mandatory service by the Zelensky regime , need to die before NATO countries actually realise it is the Ukrainians \u2013 and not the Russians , who are paying the ultimate price of more war .\nWiser heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be deescalated via the diplomatic channels , and certainly not by sending more weapons which only benefits the western military industrial complex \u2013 who once more will be the only winner of this armed conflict .\nShould the status quo in Ukraine continue , there are no positive outcomes for France .\nMacron was very disappointing during his first presidential mandate , and it seems things will be getting worse before they get better following his re-election in April 2022 for a second presidential mandate .\nOur hope now lies with the political @ @ @ @ @ @

Other GPs sent out similar letters to establishments caring for the elderly and the disabled .\nBlanket decisions were made for care homes and residential homes caring for patients with learning difficulties .\nThis isn \u2019 t entirely new , of course , and it wasn \u2019 t all a result of the coronavirus nonsense .\nA 51-year-old man with Down \u2019 s Syndrome was given a DNR because of his disability , and instructions were left that there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of a cardiac arrest or a respiratory arrest .\nNo consent form was signed and there was no agreement with the patient or his relatives .\nThe Medical Director for the relevant part of the NHS said that their policy complied fully with national guidelines from professional bodies .\nThe boss of a large charity said that they believe that DNR orders were frequently being placed on patients with learning disabilities \u2013 without the knowledge and agreement of their families .\nThis was , of course , illegal .\nBack in 2015 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruled that carers for patients with mental illnesses should be consulted before DNR notices were applied .\nBut the coronavirus nonsense has resulted in a flood of such cases .\nA man in his 50s , with sight loss , was issued with a DNR notice giving \u2018 blindness and severe learning disabilities \u2019 as the reason .\nA man with epilepsy was issued with a DNR notice , and at the end of March this year a GPs \u2019 surgery in Wales urged high risk patients to complete a DNR form if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , \u2018 you are unlikely to receive hospital admission \u2019 .\nA woman in Bristol received a phone call from her GP asking if it were OK for her medical records to be updated to say that if she contracted the coronavirus she wouldn \u2019 t go to hospital or receive any medical treatment .\nAnd on my website and in my book about the coronavirus , I have provided more evidence of this .\nBut is all this really legal ?\nWell , yes , it is if permission is obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institute for Health and Care Excellence , known as NICE , is the official advisory body to the health care world .\nAnd the NICE ruling is utterly crucial .\nNICE classified people in nine categories .\nIf you are in category 1 then you are very fit .\nIf you are in category 9 then you are terminally ill ( though , when it suits them NHS staff sometimes devise another category of \u2018 terminally , terminally ill \u2019 ) .\nOn 29th April 2020 , NICE issued amended advice to NHS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that doctors should \u2018 sensitively discuss a possible DNAR with all adults with CFs of 5 or more \u2019 .\nThis was issued in response to the coronavirus hoax .\nDoctors and nurses were instructed that they should review critical care treatment when a patient \u2018 is no longer considered able to achieve desired overall goals \u2019 .\nSo , what the devil does this mealy mouthed nonsense mean ?\nAnd what is a CF ?\nWhat does a CF of 5 mean ?\nWell the letters CF mean clinical frailty and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 means that a patient is mildly frail and may need help with heavy housework , shopping and preparing meals .\nA CF of 6 means moderately frail \u2013 people who need help with bathing .\nA CF of 7 means severely frail \u2013 people who are completely dependent for personal care .\nAnd so on .\nNow you could , I suppose , argue that if a patient is clearly dying then it would be cruel and pointless to continually attempt resuscitation .\nThat was why DNR notices were devised .\nThey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours to live and it was considered not fair to those patients to continue to \u2018 strive to keep officiously alive \u2019 .\nBut that \u2019 s not what is happening now .\nToday , in the UK , in the National Health Service a patient considered unsuitable to be saved or treated is now considered to be a patient who needs help with the heavy housework and who may have difficulty preparing meals or going to the shops .\nI could manage a bit of light dusting , I suppose , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I have available to spend on such matters .\nI would have great difficulty in preparing a meal and I hate going to the shops .\nSo , presumably , I \u2019 d get dumped into the CF5 category and so there is no hope for me , and the NHS would recommend that I be denied antibiotics , painkillers or surgery if I fell down and broke an arm .\nThe post-coronavirus hoax NHS doesn \u2019 t want to save anyone who is disabled and all patients in care homes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by omission .\nOriginally NICE told doctors that they should assess patients with autism as scoring high for frailty .\nI am , I confess , still rather confused about when or whether this advice was removed .\nI checked around with other bodies .\nI didn \u2019 t find the BMA website much help , though it did have a useful commercial webinar for doctors wanting financial advice .\nThe BMA is , after all , a trades union which exists to look after doctors not patients .\nAnd the General Medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the act by defining \u2018 approaching end of life \u2019 as patients who are likely to die within the next twelve months .\nThis , of course is the sort of dangerous rubbish one might expect from the overpaid bureaucratic form shufflers at the General Medical Council because it is always impossible to say that a patient is going to die within twelve months .\nIt may be possible to say that a patient might die within twelve hours but not twelve months .\nOnly arrogant doctors and ignorant bureaucrats claim to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve months .\nWhen I was in general practice a couple of centuries ago , I knew many patients who were given months to live but who lived many , many years .\nTwo , I remember well , had young children to look after and although they had been given only months to live they both lived for years \u2013 simply refusing to give up and surviving on sheer willpower as much as anything else .\nIf the GMC rule had been applied , they \u2019 d have been allowed to die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be going , they would have been quietly euthanized in case they fell ill and needed care .\nWhile digging around I also found this statement : \u2018 Physicians have been empowered to grant a mercy death to patients considered incurable \u2013 the mentally ill and the handicapped.\n\u2019 And then I looked a little closer and realised that the date of that policy statement was October 1939 , and the author was a well-known \u2018 medical expert \u2019 known as Adolf Hitler .\nHitler \u2019 s policy , which seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the official policy of the UK \u2019 s National Health Service these days , was created in 1920 in a book written by a psychiatrist and a lawyer ( what a deadly combination ) who argued that the economic savings justified killing those with \u2018 useless lives \u2019 .\nThe policy was to kill the incurably ill and the physically or mentally disabled and the elderly .\nHitler \u2019 s policy was officially discontinued in 1941 when it seems that even the Nazis found it a bit much .\nBut the advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NHS is still prepared to refuse life-saving treatment for the elderly , the disabled or the frail .\nRefusing treatment to patients solely because of their age or fitness is a form of eugenics .\nIt seems that social cleansing is alive and well in Britain today .\nIf you aren \u2019 t saving people ( when you could do so ) then you are killing them .\nThere doesn \u2019 t seem to me to be all that much difference between the thinking behind the policy of Matt Hancock \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s Germany .\nIf you slap a DNR form on a patient , with or without their permission , you are condemning them to death .\nIf you trick someone into agreeing to one then that \u2019 s just as bad .\nIn my view , the NHS has been Nazified .\nThere are many good doctors and nurses working for it .\nBut there are many who are so bad they are evil .\nObedient souls have been witlessly clapping the NHS and all the time the NHS has been deliberately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the frail and the elderly .\nThe British shouldn \u2019 t have been clapping \u2013 we should have been clicking our heels and snapping off fancy Heil Hitler salutes .\nWhich of us gave doctors permission to behave like Nazis and to deny treatment to people considered unimportant , expensive or expendable ?\nIn my view , every single doctor or nurse or administrator who has put a DNR notice on a patient under these regulations should be fired , arrested and imprisoned .\nI don \u2019 t know what for .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ these people sleep at night ?\nDon \u2019 t they feel anything for the people they are supposed to be looking after ?\nI am prepared to believe that not everyone in health care can have a genuine vocation .\nBut the people who were scattering these DNR notices around were paid to look after people .\nAnd they have betrayed those people .\nDo Not Resuscitate notices were devised to ensure that the genuinely terminally ill were allowed to die with dignity \u2013 without being dragged time and time again from wherever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originally a necessary part of medicine \u2013 to avoid General Franco type situation .\nBut now we have a thousand Dr Mengele clones working in the health service .\nThat sounds as if I \u2019 m exaggerating but the sad thing is that I am not .\nDr Mengele would have thrived in today \u2019 s NHS .\nHe \u2019 d have liked the clapping and the adulation too .\nNICE should be disbanded immediately .\nWe \u2019 d all be better off without it .\nMeanwhile , if you think you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C5 or worse , it might be a good idea to ask your GP if you \u2019 ve been put on the \u2018 suitable for dying \u2019 list .",

Tree", "content": "I \u2019 m young enough to remember times before the apocalypse .\nI recollect the announcement of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn \u2019 s manifesto in 2019 .\nIt was a modest manifesto focussed on education , health and social care and other social needs .\nIt sought to address the rampant inequality in British society through investment in local services which had been gutted by decades of privatisation .\nBy all means it was a good manifesto , as they go .\nIt was clear in its aims , and having been constructed by experts in their respective fields , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAs with any policy formulation it had to be budgeted , a modest \u00a380 billion was the cost which would surely be recouped by a growth in productivity .\nThe play was made , Corbyn was at his zenith , having almost clinched the previous election ; 2019 was seen as his last chance for premiership and he had momentum on his side .\nThen word came from on high .\nThe spin doctors and wizardly wonks at Conservative HQ had their retort crafted .\nIt was a simple three word phrase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , became an incantation : \u201c Magic Money Tree \u201d .\n\u2018 Where does communist Corbyn think this money will come from ?\n\u2019 they asked .\nOne can \u2019 t just conjure up money from thin air , there is no magic money tree .\nThis painted the Labour leader as a reckless spender and the landed gentry Conservative party as fiscally trustworthy .\nAt first , it seemed like a weak attack , the Conservatives proposed no alternative policy to address any of the problems raised .\nBut as any mature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t matter in politics .\nThrough a supplicant , lenient media , through guffawing boorish sessions of parliament and through boisterous speeches at the bully pulpit , Corbyn \u2019 s case was demolished .\nAt every juncture the spell was chanted , the mystical utopian \u2018 magic money tree \u2019 was not realistic and Corbyn lost the election , and soon after he was ejected from the party at large in favour of a centrist alternative .\nThe successful Conservative campaign preyed on the uninformed electorate .\nMost voters don \u2019 t comprehend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I \u2019 m sure many experts don \u2019 t .\nThe implication of the argument was that all government spending must come from taxation , thus any increase of expenditure would mean a concurrent increase in taxation \u2013 with \u2018 more tax \u2019 being the worst electoral move a politician can make .\nHowever , it is not the case that all government spending comes from taxation .\nA large chunk of the spending power of most governments comes from their ability to create debt .\nThey can ask a central bank to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This covers the shortfall in spending .\nI argue that it also allows for a huge and ineffective bureaucracy to spring up around this easy money .\nWhen a government can literally print money , and issue loans backed by no gold or asset , they have access to the proverbial magic money tree .\nInterestingly , this swindle goes by the acronym \u201c MMT , \u201d which stands for Modern Monetary Theory , which bears a striking resemblance to the Magic Money Tree .\nMake no mistake : there are though real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has become startlingly apparent in 2022 : inflation .\nWhen the money supply is expanded to feed parasitic banks , to pay off their gambling debts and to pay off huge corrupt contracts to politicians \u2019 friends , it devalues the currency .\nWhilst the UK government on paper spent \u00a31 trillion on who knows what in 2021 , its financial hound dog , the Bank of England , undertook a huge program of quantitative easing \u2013 money printing .\nThey effectively created \u00a3900 billion , out of thin air \u2013 these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunlight or water , as a tree would , to achieve their magic .\nI use these maleficent words to describe them as the true cost of their quantitative easing is inflation that today means poor mothers can \u2019 t afford to feed their children , elderly face a winter without heating : a death sentence for many .\nOnce again the power brokers are able to play magic tricks behind closed doors at the real life cost of the vulnerable in society .\nUpon the undertaking of a new era of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Pfeffel \u2018 Boris \u2019 Johnson , the UK \u2019 s Prime Minister delivered a rousing speech to an imprisoned population .\n\u201c This is a government that is wholly committed not just to defeating coronavirus but to using this crisis finally to tackle this country \u2019 s great unresolved challenges of the last three decades .\nTo that end we will build , build , build .\nBuild back better , build back greener , build back faster and to do that at the pace that this moment requires.\n\u201d One consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locking adults away in their homes and shutting down most small businesses was a breakdown of the economy .\nThis gave those in positions of power , the chance to manifest their great reset , to reshape society and the economy in a way more suited to their liking .\nOne may look hopefully at the part where Johnson would redress inequality and corrupt financial activity which marred British society in the last three decades .\nBut it turns out that was just more hot air .\nThe real thrust of this speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greener \u201d .\nIt almost fades into the background , another politician saying \u2018 green \u2019 this \u2018 green \u2019 that is not uncommon .\nHowever , it emerges that the \u2018 green \u2019 route will be a strong avenue for governments to establish greater control over the populous and to reap great profits in the process .\nThe keystone of the \u2018 build back greener \u2019 policy framework is the almost 400 page \u2018 Net Zero Strategy \u2019 document .\nThere is an obsession amongst environmental politics with \u2018 carbon \u2019 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose seems to be to boil off all life on Earth .\nNowhere in this document is mentioned pollution , reducing waste or reforming industry .\nThere are no forward-thinking plans to tackle \u201c e-waste , \u201d or to address light , sound and chemical pollution in the air and in our environment .\nAnd of course , no mention of the bees , even though most people would welcome any policy which would save them and rebuild their colonies .\nYet , amongst the green waffling about \u201c our planet \u201d and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into an actual policy agenda .\nTo save you the time , I will highlight some of the salient points\u2026 Amongst the new privations the government would like to roll out is a pledge to ban the sale of all combustion engine cars by 2030 .\nGone will be the days when a person could buy a relatively cheap vehicle for their business or personal use .\nBy 2035 they wish to make using any existing petrol or diesel car illegal .\nYes , you read it right , and they intend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no consideration for how it will affect people across all strata of society .\nThere is a little mention of improving public transport , albeit with a very modest budget , and an interesting yet strange section about making cycling mandatory in city centres .\nYet , the policy is to ban first , and offer alternatives later .\nThe alternative which the British will be funneled into is electric cars ( if you are lucky enough to afford one that is ) .\nClearly , these top-down diktats haven \u2019 t been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all .\nNow electric cars have been proven to be highly polluting to produce and unsustainable .\nTo replace every car in the UK with an electric vehicle would require : twice the global supply of cobalt , the whole global annual supply of neodymium , three-quarters of the world \u2019 s lithium and \u201c at least half \u201d of the world \u2019 s copper .\nYet the government is going full speed ahead with their plan , ring fencing \u00a3300 million of the green budget to electric vehicle research .\nThe green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public and private money , a cosy backroom deal which means that \u201c HM Government has mobilised \u00a326 billion of government capital investment for the green industrial revolution \u201d .\nAnother branch on the magic money tree .\nThis \u00a326 billion is not in the hands of the government , as that would open up avenues for corruption .\nInstead , they follow a squeaky clean model whereby the money is held by a non-departmental body which oversees the handing out of grants .\nThis department is called \u2018 Innovate UK \u2019 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Investment body .\nSo we can be safe in the knowledge that the UK \u2019 s net-zero build back greener policy is in the hands of honest and trustworthy individuals .\nSuch as the Chairman of UKRI Andrew Mackenzie .\nHe is also currently chairman of Shell plc , the oil giant .\nHe has also worked for BP , so we know he is even-handed , and was also recently the chairman of BHP Billiton , the world \u2019 s largest mining company .\nIt comes as no surprise then that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ecologically harmful , \u00a33 million has been put up by Innovate UK for a new lithium mine in Cornwall .\nI \u2019 m sure that Mr Mackenzie ( how is he not a Sir already ? )\nis capable of making sure that mining takes place in a safe and clean way and that any profits from dredging traces of lithium from the Cornish coastline will go back to the local populations .\nPutting such facetiousness aside , the net-zero strategy is an absolute boondoggle .\nSo much money has been spent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we scratch the surface , benefit the exact guilty parties who wreak havoc on the environment they purport to protect .\nIt \u2019 s no surprise to find out from Cory Morningstar that Shell amongst others like Deloitte , Tata and other industrial giants help draft legislation for global environmental policy through groups like the Natural Capital Coalition .\nI encourage you to look at her work to see how \u201c The Natural Capital Coalition has been developing the tools and protocols for a new global system of finance where all nature will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carney , former governor of the Bank of England and now freshly segued into a new role as UN special envoy for climate and finance , said : \u201c The transition to net-zero is creating the greatest commercial opportunity of our time .\nNet-zero targets must be underpinned by transition plans so that investors can assess which companies will seize the opportunities in the transition and which will cease to exist.\n\u201d Without question , you will see the Shell logo , given a green tint in years to come .\nAnother of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tinto , will be armed with a stack of \u2018 sustainable \u2019 stickers to slap on the back of their mining bulldozers .\nThe same car giants who lied about diesel engines , the same oil companies who put lead into the fuel despite knowing its toxicity will be green washed and neatly woven into the net-zero tapestry .\nI \u2019 m sure that some forests will be planted as part of this , who knows of what actual ecological benefit , but they will only be planted for the carbon-credits .\nTo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new system of control over nature .\nThe only \u2018 green \u2019 part of this fusion of venture capitalism and government regulation is the wads of cash that are doled out to suitably obscure corporations .\nAnd the only net-zero is the zero-sum game where the global poor continue to be exploited and poisoned for the enrichment of a small cadre of oligarchs .\nAs far as I have seen there is little pushback from either environmentalists or the public at large .\nThe machinations of monetary theory are murky , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on before we \u2019 re sold down the river .\nThere is huge hope in my eyes when I see the passion of young people to manifest a healthy and clean environment and to nurture nature .\nThat hope is to be protected and not put down as na\u00efvet\u00e9 .\nIt must also be kept from the corporate overlords who wish to force inhuman actions to be taken , to remove our most natural birthright : the planet Earth in all her majestic bounty .\nWhat got me riled back in 2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money tree .\nNow the MMT has taken root and \u2018 green \u2019 politics has fertilised a magic money forest .\nSEE MORE BIG PHARMA NEWS AT :

, and if smaller herds aren \u2019 t financially feasible , they \u2019 ll have to shut down altogether \u2022 None The decision to decimate cattle farming in the name of environmental protection rings hollow in the face of looming food shortages and potential famine worldwide .\nIt appears they \u2019 re intentionally trying to make meat so scarce and expensive that regular people can \u2019

one , ultimately , the Green Agenda isn \u2019 t about the environment \u2014 it \u2019 s about creating a control system in which the world \u2019 s resources are owned by the richest of the rich , while the rest of the population is controlled through the allocation of those resources , and that includes the allocation of food Analysis by Dr Joseph Mercola\u2026 The Netherlands is currently in an uproar over the government \u2019 s decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 % in an effort to halve its nitrogen and ammonia pollution by 2030.1 As a result of this \u201c green \u201d policy , many farmers will be driven out of business.2 As with current energy shortages , the resulting reductions in farming are said to be an \u201c unavoidable \u201d part of the Green Agenda to improve air , soil and water quality.3 The Dutch government has even appointed a new Minister of Nature and Nitrogen to oversee the climate goals.4 Provincial authorities now have one year to work out how they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction targets .\nIn a public statement about the new emissions targets , the Dutch government admitted that \u201c The honest message \u2026 is that not all farmers can continue their business.\n\u201d 5 Those who do continue will have to come up with creative solutions to meet the new emissions restrictions .\nHow Do Cows Contribute to Nitrogen and Ammonia Pollution ?\nCattle are fed nitrogen in the form of crude protein .\nWhile protein is an essential nutrient for cows , nitrogen is not efficiently broken down by cattle , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the urine and feces as urea .\nWhen urine and feces get mixed together , the urea is converted into ammonia.6,7 Since the amount of ammonia produced is related to the crude protein the animals are fed , one suggested way to lower the ammonia is to reduce the amount of crude protein in the animals \u2019 diet .\n( Other factors such as season also impact ammonia production , but farmers have no control over that . )\nA potential problem with that idea is that cattle have protein requirements just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crucial for healthy development , muscle growth and lactation .\nAs noted in a 2009 paper8 by Jane Parish , a beef cattle specialist in Mississippi , \u201c Providing adequate protein in beef cattle diets is important for animal health and productivity as well as ranch profitability.\n\u201d Responsible farmers give their cattle just the right amount , so cutting crude protein could impact both the animals \u2019 health and farm productivity .\nIf they don \u2019 t cut crude protein , they \u2019 ll have to downsize their herds , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they \u2019 ll have to shut down altogether .\nNeedless to say , many are outraged , as skyrocketing fertilizer and feed costs have already cut profits for farmers and raised prices for consumers .\nSEE ALSO : Get Ready for the \u2018 Plate Reset \u2019 As noted in a July 1 , 2022 , report by Peter Imanuelsen , an independent journalist in Sweden , the timing of this brazen attack on cattle farmers is a curious one , and one that can only really be explained as an intentional strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by manufacturing a food crisis:9 In response to the new nitrogen and ammonia restrictions , an estimated 40,000 Dutch farmers have gathered in protest , arguing the attack on farming is irrational and unfair , as other industries responsible for far greater amounts of pollution \u2014 such as transport , construction and aviation \u2014 aren \u2019 t facing the same restrictions .\nThey \u2019 ve blocked a number of highways with tractors and even sprayed manure on the town hall in Lochem.10 Local police have reportedly responded by shooting at some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the video above .\nAs explained by Plant Based News,11 nitrogen makes up about 78 % of the earth \u2019 s atmosphere and is essential for life .\nHowever , in excess , and in the wrong areas , it can damage the ecosystem .\nNitrogen runoff from concentrated animal feeding operations ( CAFOs ) and farms using synthetic pesticides and fertilizers can leach into and contaminate water supplies .\nNitrogen runoff can also cause algae blooms when it enters lakes or oceans .\nThis depletes the water of oxygen and creates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sustained .\nThis is why I \u2019 ve long advocated against CAFOs and conventional industrial farms that rely on chemicals to grow food .\nThat doesn \u2019 t mean livestock are a blight on the eco system , however .\nQuite the contrary .\nLivestock raised in accordance with regenerative agriculture principles will heal and massively improve soil quality and help stabilize the climate .\nSo , it \u2019 s not cows per se that are the problem .\nIt \u2019 s the industrialization of cattle ranching that causes it to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , is not to eliminate meat production .\nThe answer is to transition into a regenerative system .\nSince the transition can take a few years , during which profits may be marginal or absent , many farmers hesitate to take this step on their own .\nGovernment could facilitate the transition by subsidizing farmers that make the switch , but none have opted to do so .\nWhy ?\nCould it be because regenerative farming is the converse of what The Great Reset is all about ?\nIn 2019 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Council of State , ruled the Dutch government was in breach of European Union law that called for stark cuts in nitrogen emissions.12 Following that ruling , some 18,000 infrastructure projects were abandoned in an attempt to meet the EU restrictions .\nThe Dutch government also lowered the maximum daytime speed limit on highways to 100 kilometers an hour ( 61 mph ) .\nAll of that still wasn \u2019 t enough though , so now the Finance and Agriculture Ministry wants to reduce the number of livestock by 30 % .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers .\nIn any given year , they raise some 4 million beef cattle alone .\nBut reducing the number of cattle by 30 % will not only have ramifications for the Dutch , but all of the EU , because The Netherlands is the largest meat exporter in the EU.13 In September 2021 , Rudi Buis , a spokesperson for the Dutch agriculture ministry , told The Guardian:14 Apparently , the option they \u2019 ve chosen is starvation and nutritional deficiencies for all .\nThe saddest part of it is that eliminating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fabulous impact they say it will have .\nIt \u2019 s a fraudulent greenwashing enterprise that will destroy humanity instead .\nWhile the notion of a pollution-free world is an attractive one , ultimately , the Green Agenda isn \u2019 t about the environment \u2014 it \u2019 s about creating a control system in which the world \u2019 s resources are owned by the richest of the rich , while the rest of the population is controlled through the allocation of those resources , and that includes the allocation of food .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rockefeller Foundation While looming food shortages are now blamed on climate change and the Russia-Ukraine conflict , the Rockefeller Foundation discussed coming food shortages as an inevitability back in July 2020 , and called for a revamping of the food system to address it .\nSeeing how true prophets are few and far in between these days , it seems more reasonable to suspect that paper was delineating a known , intentional plan .\nThe document in question , titled \u201c Reset the Table : Meeting the Moment to Transform the U.S. Food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 28 , 2020 .\nIt describes how the COVID pandemic had caused \u201c a hunger and nutrition crisis \u201d in the U.S. \u201c unlike any this country has seen in generations.\n\u201d Mind you , COVID was declared a pandemic March 11 , 2020 , so by the time this Rockefeller report was published , the pandemic had only existed for four months , and while certain high-risk groups did experience food insecurity , such as children whose primary meal is a school lunch , widespread food shortages , in terms of empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly severe in the U.S .\nThe title itself is also revealing , as it \u2019 s a clear play on The Great Reset , which was officially announced by the World Economic Forum ( WEF ) and the Prince of Wales in early June 2020.16 The title alone tells us that the Rockefeller Foundation \u2019 s call for a food system reset is part and parcel of the WEF \u2019 s Great Reset .\nMany of the contributors to the Foundation \u2019 s paper are WEF members , which further strengthens this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president Dr. Rajiv Shah also stresses that \u201c a comprehensive playbook \u201d to address the food system will also need to address other issues , \u201c such as living wages , housing and transportation , \u201d and that \u201c all of us \u201d \u2014 meaning the self-proclaimed designers of the future \u2014 \u201c need to write that playbook together over the coming year.\n\u201d What better way to predict the future than to actually create it ?\nAll of those things \u2014 wages , housing and transportation \u2014 are all facets that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s Fourth Industrial Revolution , as artificial intelligence , robotics , surveillance , social engineering and transhumanism ( the merger of man with machine ) take over .\nIn summary , \u201c Reset the Table \u201d describes how they intend to seize control of the food supply and the supply chain under the guise of \u201c equity , \u201d \u201c fairness \u201d and \u201c environmental protection.\n\u201d As noted by ThreadsIrish on Substack:18 One key to this enterprise is data collection .\nThey want to collect data on everyone \u2019 s spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that data collection , they want to shift everything into an online environment , including education , medicine and the buying of food .\nAnother key to success is \u201c changes to policies , practices and norms.\n\u201d The goal is to centralize control of the food supply into a single executive office , which is right in line with the idea of a \u201c one world government.\n\u201d As WEF member Henry Kissinger once said , \u201c Who controls the food supply controls the people ; who controls the energy can control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control the world.\n\u201d Getting back to the issue of Dutch beef production being strangled , the reason global leaders seem so unconcerned with dwindling meat production is probably because they don \u2019 t want us to eat meat .\nThey intend for us to eat lab grown synthetic meat that can be patented , and insects,19 which can easily and inexpensively be produced in mass quantities using very little land .\nAs noted in a July 2021 WEF article titled , \u201c Why We Need to Give Insects the Role They Deserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insects are \u201c a credible and efficient alternative protein source requiring fewer resources than conventional breeding , \u201d and \u201c a healthy ingredient \u201d that is highly digestible and particularly suitable for senior nutrition .\nInsect farming also requires few natural resources , such as water , and could reduce agricultural pollution by nearly 99 % .\nThe article points out that the last barrier to making insect burgers the norm is \u201c preconceived ideas about insects as a source of food and legislation with regard to the use and consumption of proteins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that \u201c Reset the Table \u201d is promoting a diet of insects as well , because while it stresses the need for a \u201c healthy diet \u201d and \u201c sustainable agriculture , \u201d the words \u201c organic \u201d and \u201c grass fed \u201d do not appear a single time , and the word \u201c natural \u201d is only used in reference to \u201c natural disasters.\n\u201d In other words , their versions of \u201c healthy diet \u201d and \u201c sustainable agriculture \u201d do not include what we know are basic criteria for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food supply .\nThe Foundation \u2019 s call for changes to \u201c policies , practices and norms \u201d also indicates that the diet they \u2019 re talking about involves something that is outside the norm .\nBoth lab-grown meat and insects are outside the norm of what most people are willing to put in their mouth , and thus policies about what constitutes \u201c food \u201d need to be changed , as do food production practices and social norms about what \u2019 s acceptable to eat and what \u2019 s not .\nWhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cash cow of the future , many scientists are leery .\nIn mid-June 2022 , the Center for Food Safety ( CFS ) held a webinar in which a panel of experts addressed a number of questions surrounding lab-grown meats , including safety and regulatory issues.21 One of the panelists was Michael Hansen , Ph.D. , a senior staff scientist with Consumer Reports .\nHe raised concerns about cell-cultured meats , where biopsied cells from an animal are grown in fetal bovine blood ( extracted from a live , aborted baby calf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of manipulated DNA segments , as that could have unforeseen consequences , but he pointed out that we also have no data on the nutritional composition of this kind of meat .\nAs reported by The Defender:22 Tom Neltner , chemicals policy director at the Environmental Defense Fund ( EDF ) , was also part of the panel .\nNeltner noted that while sustainable protein sources are needed , lab-grown meats will be proprietary , meaning the full ingredients list and how they \u2019 re made is a trade secret , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their effect or what they are.\n\u201d The Defender added:23 Everything now points to food shortages and famine becoming a reality in many parts of the world , including the U.S. and Europe.24 As yet , stores are still fairly well stocked with essentials , but that will change come winter and into 2023 .\nThis means you may only have another six months or so to stock up .\nThis past Monday , I published an article with suggestions for how to prepare .\nThat article , \u201c Get Prepared With Shelf-Stable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for free on Substack , so if you missed it , you can review it now .\nAuthor Dr. Joseph Mercola is the founder of

universally acknowledged that Turkey \u2019 s President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan ( whom I like to call \u2018 the Prez \u2019 ) is quite fond of his Ottoman forebears and their accomplishments .\nAnd though , upon abolishing the Caliphate in 1924 , the Kemalist regime exiled the members of the dynasty , recently quite a few Ottomans ( bearing the surname Osmano\u011flu ) are back on Turkish soil : in \u2018 1952 , female members of the dynasty were granted amnesty and the men were allowed to return to Turkey in 1974.\n\u2019 These men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loins of Sultan Abd\u00fclhamid II ( 1876-1909 ) , the one Ottoman whom the Prez truly admires and attempts to emulate .\nAnd , as if to underline this preoccupation , the Turkish state broadcaster TRT has been airing an historical soap titled Pay\u0131taht : Abd\u00fclhamid ( meaning The Capital , as in \u0130stanbul , and originally released between 24 February 2017\u20134 June 2021 ) supposedly dealing with the reign and rule of

Republic \u2019 s centenary next year ( 1923-2023 ) , some voices predict the electoral end of the Prez and his AKP cohorts \u2013 arguably a somewhat premature if not outright misleading verdict .\nIn this vein , Tayyip Erdo\u011fan continues doing what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressing huge crowds of devoted voters and sympathizers .\nThe other day , he attended an event organized by his party \u2019 s youth wing ( AK Parti Gen\u00e7lik Kollar\u0131 ) in the southern city of Adana .\nThis \u201c Youth Celebration \u201d ( or \u2018 Bir Gen\u00e7lik \u015e\u00f6leni \u2019 ) , held in the Yeni Adana Stad\u0131 football stadium , included performances of various popular artists such as Erdem K\u0131nay , U\u011fur I\u015f\u0131lak , Tu\u011f\u00e7e Kandemir and O\u011fuzhan Ko\u00e7 .\nThe Prez was not shy about addressing the full-capacity crowd in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got straight down to brass tacks , attacking the opposition \u0130Y\u0130 Parti \u2019 s leader .\nMeral Ak\u015fener had namely compared his one-man rule to the \u2018 legendary \u2019 despotism of the Ottoman Sultan Abd\u00fclhamid II : m \u201c Youngsters , one needs to ask this lady attacking , [

Who is Mrs Ak\u015fener to [ show ] disrespect to Sultan Abd\u00fclhamid .\n.\n.\none has to teach those who insult Sultan Abd\u00fclhamid who resides in Heaven a lesson .\nIt is easy to say 33 years .\nThis nation will teach those who insult their forebears a lesson.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turkish media , with everybody having his or her say on the topic .\nThe media-savvy and popular historian Prof. Dr. \u0130lber Ortayl\u0131 , whose presence graces many a Turkish television programme , came out and unequivocally stated that \u201c [ t ] here is no claim that territories have not been lost.\n\u201d In his own popular history book Yak\u0131n tarihin ger\u00e7ekleri ( \u2018 Realities of Recent History \u2019 ) , Ortayl\u0131 puts it like this : \u201c It has been said that [ Sultan Abd\u00fclhamid II ] did not enter [ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of territories during his reign.\n\u201d In contrast , as long ago as 22 September 2016 , the prominent AKP member Burhan Kuzu tweeted that \u2018 Abd\u00fclhamid II was a statesman on the global stage , [ who ] ruled this land for 33 years in a most confused era without losing [ even ] an inch of territory.\n\u2019 Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has clearly used Kuzu \u2019 s tweet as his source , even literally employing the same words and expressions ( \u201c bir kar\u0131\u015f toprak kaybetmeden y\u00f6netti \u201d ) .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ historian , but an expert on constitutional law .\nYet , he seems quite at ease tweeting historical falsities ( or Fake News , if you will ) into the ether , particularly concerning Sultan Abd\u00fclhamid II .\nThis particular Ottoman is a favourite among Turkish Islamists , as I explained in 2017 : \u2018 In 1883 , the French journalist Gabriel Charmes ( 1850-86 ) coined the term \u201c panislamisme \u201c to describe .\n.\n.\nSultan Abd\u00fclhamid II \u2019 s .\n.\n.\npolicy of consolidating his hold over the remaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the increasing loss of European territories in the Balkans .\nCharmes \u2019 programmatic book on \u2018 Turkey \u2019 s future \u2019 \u2013 L \u2019 avenir de la Turquie : le Panislamisme , suggested creating a united Islamic front against the common enemy \u2013 the Great Powers ( or D\u00fcvel-i Muazzama , in Ottoman ) , that is to say Great Britain , France , Austria-Hungary , Italy , Germany and particularly , the Russian Empire .\nAs a result , the Sultan was thus \u201c singularly reluctant to use the army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the renowned French specialist Fran\u00e7ois Georgeon and translated by Dr Selim Deringil .\nI would like to argue that it was these \u2018 Islamist credentials \u2019 led the poet and writer Necip Faz\u0131l K\u0131sak\u00fcrek ( 1904-83 ) to commence the intellectual rehabilitation of Sultan Abd\u00fclhamid in 1965 \u2013 writing the panegyric book Ulu Hakan Abdulhamit Han on the Sultan and his reign .\nAs a \u201c Born-Again-Muslim , \u201c Necip Faz\u0131l \u2019 s poetic oeuvre has been long-favoured by Turkey \u2019 s Islamists , opposed to the permissive and modernist innovations introduced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and the subsequent liberal atmosphere that has led many to speak of \u201c Turkish Secularism.\n\u201d The independent journalist Ayfer Erkul characterises K\u0131sak\u00fcrek as an \u201c Islamofascist poet and ideologue , \u201d who dreamt of a \u201c totalitarian country completely determined by Islam , \u201d of a country inhabited solely by \u201c Muslim Turks.\n\u201d And recently , Dr. Umut Uzer suggested that \u201c the AKP leadership is trying to create a new identity and historical thesis for Turkey based on K\u0131sak\u00fcrek \u2019 s ideas , \u201d ideas that appear crystalised in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Abd\u00fclhamid II , the sultan who ruled the Ottoman dominions for 33 years without losing an inch of territory .\nOn the other hand , the renowned Ottomanist and Abd\u00fclhamid specialist Dr Selim Deringil \u2013 he did write the book on the man , but don \u2019 t be misled by the title , The Well-protected Domains Ideology and the Legitimation of Power in the Ottoman Empire 1876-1909 ( 1998 ) \u2013 describes those 33 years as the \u201c most critical period in [ Turkey \u2019 s ] recent history.\n\u201d But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Abd\u00fclhamid really such a perfect Ottoman ?\nIn the latter part of the month of May , Ak\u015fener appeared on the opposition television channel Halk TV where she compared today \u2019 s Turkey with the situation a hundred years ago .\nAk\u015fener spoke about a \u201c revolt \u201d against a \u201c dictatorial system , against a system that was moving towards autocracy.\n\u201d Adding that the essence of that system was \u201c Abd\u00fclhamid , if that is what our friends are saying , then the essence of today [ \u2018 s system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan.\n\u201d Ak\u015fener was commenting upon the so-called Young Turk revolution of 1908 , a military take-over that led to the reinstatement of the short-lived Ottoman Constitution ( or K\u0101n\u00fbn-\u0131 Es\u00e2s\u00ee , 1876-8 ) .\nBut rather than talk about the finer points of historical parallels and/or justified and/or misguided comparisons , the Prez took her words as a personal insult , as I explained in 2016 , for him the political is personal .\nIn order to get a grip on the Hamidian reality ( 1876-1908 ) and the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to turn to the well-esteemed Professor Stanford J. Shaw ( 1930-2006 ) .\nProfessor Shaw is one of the last historians to have attempted to write a full Ottoman history , from its early beginnings till the very end and its aftermath : History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey , in 2 volumes published in 1976-77 .\nAs an outspoken Turcophile , Shaw \u2019 s tomes paint a sympathetic yet meticulous picture of the topic , from the Empire of the Gazis ( vol .\n1 ) to Reform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 ) .\nDr Shaw begins his argument on the much-maligned sultan as follows : \u201c [ i ] t is a mistake to assume that Abd\u00fclhamit came to the throne with the intention of establishing his autocracy .\n.\n.\n[ i ] n fact , he initially reversed [ Sultan ] Abd\u00fclaziz \u2019 s personal rule by accepting the Constitution.\n\u201d But , \u201c which he later abolished when he found the opportunity in 1878 , \u201d as interjected by Dr. Nurullah Ard\u0131\u00e7 .\nDr Shaw concedes by saying that Abd\u00fclhamid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined by the events and conditions he witnessed following his accession.\n\u201d This Ottoman may have been a moderniser , but circumstances forced him to abandon the path towards democracy that was opened by the Ottoman Parliament and Constitution .\nShaw even provides a quotation to underline this verdict .\nSultan Abd\u00fclhamid II made the following written confession , as quoted in Shaw \u2019 s book : I made a mistake when I wished to imitate my father , Abd\u00fclmecid , who sought to reform by persuasion and by liberal institutions .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandfather , Sultan Mahmud .\nLike him I now understand that it is only by force that one can move the people with whose protection God has entrusted me .\nBut in the present context , it seems pertinent to examine the popular claim that he ruled the Ottoman dominions for 33 years without losing \u2018 an inch of territory.\n\u2019 Looking at a map of the 19th century Ottoman Empire clearly shows that AKP members are basically drinking their own Kool Aid .\nKuzu , Erdo\u011fan , and numerous other hapless Turks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rosy-coloured narrative \u2013 an Ottoman story that is their very own Ottoman counter-narrative to the seemingly secular Republican ideology and its concomitant historical myths .\nOn the opposite end of the ideological spectrum , the anti-racist and feminist world history teacher Bram Hubbell puts it like this on his website Liberating Narratives \u2013 World History of the Oppressed : At some point during the middle of the nineteenth century , European diplomats , believing that the Ottoman Empire was near its end , began calling the Ottoman Empire the \u201c Sick Man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily see that the Ottomans lost control of more than half their territory .\nOn the eve of the First World War I , the Ottoman Empire had contracted to the area around Istanbul , Anatolia , the Levant , and Mesopotamia .\nLooking at the map , Ottoman territorial losses in Sultan Abd\u00fclhamid II \u2019 s reign can be listed as follows : in the aftermath of the Treaty of Berlin ( 13 July 1878 ) , \u201c the Ottomans had to leave Kars , Ardahan , and Batum to Russia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homeland to its northern rival ; in addition the following extra-Anatolian territories were also lost : Bosnia-Hercegovina ( 1878 ) , Serbia ( 1878 ) , Bulgaria ( 1878 ) , Cyprus ( 1878 ) , Tunisia ( 1881 ) , Egypt ( 1882 ) , and Crete ( 1898 ) .\nShaw remarks dryly that \u201c the Treaty of Berlin ended the Ottoman Empire as a significant European power.\n\u201d In other words , Sultan Abd\u00fclhamid II \u2019 s time of 33 years on the Ottoman throne was hardly a period in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nQuite to the contrary , I would like to add .\nThe myth of Hamidian invincibility is clearly a product of the blind faith put in the writings of Necip Faz\u0131l K\u0131sak\u00fcrek and partiularly his hagiographic image of the Ulu Hakan Abdulhamit Han , the awesome Ottoman sultan ( the \u201c Grand Ruler \u201d ) who gave Islam its due while supposedly keeping foreign powers at bay .\nThe late Stanford Shaw expresses these sentiments in the following way : \u201d [ t ] hrough his autocracy Abd\u00fclhamit managed to restore and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society , and bring to a successful conclusion most of the [ Ottoman ] reforms.\n\u201d And in this context , I would like to point out that \u201c Ottoman Modernization [ or reform ] was a defensive and progressive program carried out by the \u2018 authority \u2019 in order to preserve the continuity and territorial integrity of the empire in the face of Western imperialism , \u201d as worded by the doctoral student Tunay \u015eendal .\nStill , as expressed by Deringil , Abd\u00fclhamid II \u201c is clearly the last sultan who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his two successors ( Mehmed V and Vahdettin ) , who \u201c were nothing more than figureheads who had only symbolic power.\n\u201d As a result , the \u201c Grand Ruler \u201d Abd\u00fclhamid II does stand out as the true last Ottoman Sultan in the minds and memories of many Turks and most ( if not all ) Turkish Islamists .\nAnd with a bit of poetic licence , this final \u201c Grand Ruler \u201d became an Ottoman sultan successfully holding on to his lands and territories , though the reality on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , for people like Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and his folowers ( or believers ) , \u201c Abd\u00fclhamid II \u201d has become the \u201c Founding Father of the Turkish State , \u201d quoting the title of Dr Edhem Eldem \u2019 s 2018 paper in the Journal of the Ottoman and Turkish Studies Association .\nIn a nutshell , this Hamidian story represents the Turkish dream pursued by the Prez and his AKP henchmen : not Atat\u00fcrk , but Abd\u00fclhamid II as the man ( or Muslim Turk ) who was convincingly defeated by Turkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to lay the foundations of the Republic of Turkey on the Anatolian pensinsula ( the Ottoman heartland ) \u2013 the territories Abd\u00fclhamid did safeguard and that Mustafa Kemal solidified in 1919 \u2019 s \u2018 National Pact \u2019 ( or Misak-\u0131 Mill\u00ee ) and that subsequently became the \u2018 geo-body \u2019 of today \u2019 s Turkey , to use Thongchai Winichakul \u2019 s 1997 coinage .\nNowadays the term jihad is much bandied about and used and/or abused at will by Muslims as well as non-Muslims the world over .\nWhat most people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is the distinction between the greater jihad ( al-jih\u0101d al-akbar ) and the lesser jihad ( al-jih\u0101d al-asghar ) .\nThe ih\u0101d al-akbar denotes a personal struggle in the way of Allah , that should be practised by each and every Muslim ( crf .\nSurah 29:69 ) .\nThe jih\u0101d al-asghar , on the other hand , refers to an armed struggle to protect believers against oppression and violence perpetrated by unbelievers .\nTurkey \u2019 s AKP government has over the years also transformed the poet K\u0131sak\u00fcrek into a quasi-mythical figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself called K\u0131sak\u00fcrek \u2019 s Ulu Hakan a \u201c manifesto of struggle , \u201d using the Turkish term \u2018 dava , \u2019 as if his poems were to encapsulate the Turkish nation \u2019 s struggle for Islam , and the Turks \u2019 commitment to the Prophet \u2019 s cause .\nNowadays , audiences in the West have become quite familiar with the term Jihad and as such , the Turkish term \u2018 dava \u2019 basically corresponds to the Arabic Jihad , when used in a broadly religious or rather Islamic context .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started hosting annual \u2018 Necip Faz\u0131l \u00f6d\u00fclleri \u2019 award ceremonies \u2013 won by such Musl\u0131m luminaries as the poet Mustafa Aydo\u011fan , the novelist Mukadder Gemici , or the theologian Dr Mustafa Uluda\u011f , intellectuals whose works have honoured the glory of Islam inside the New Turkey and in this way served the nation \u2019 s dava or Jihad .\nIn the above-quoted his speech , Tayyip Erdo\u011fan added that \u201c Necip Faz\u0131l believed that in order to understand today \u2019 s Turkey it is necessary to first understand Abd\u00fclhamid II.\n\u201d In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a political force seems to necessarily rear its ugly head .\nThis is another link between the Prez and his favourite Ottoman .\nIn connection with Abd\u00fclhamid II , the concept of \u2018 Pan-Islamism \u2019 pops up in connection with his domestic and international policies .\nIn the aftermath of the Treaty of Berlin , the prolific French journalist Charmes suggested in L \u2019 avenir de la Turquie : le Panislamisme that the Ottomans would ( or could ) create a united Islamic front against the common threat \u2013 the Great Powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , France , Austria-Hungary , Italy and Germany and particularly , the Russian Empire .\nWriting in his seminal \u00dc\u00e7 Tarz-i Siyaset ( or \u2018 Three Types of Policy , \u2019 1904 ) , the Ottoman writer and historian Yusuf Ak\u00e7ura ( 1876-1935 ) explains the ideological permutations that swept through the late-Ottoman Empire , from multi-confessional Ottomanism to strict Islamism : When the policy of creating an Ottoman nation failed , the policy of Islamism appeared .\nThis idea which the Europeans term Pan-Islamism .\n.\n.\nSultan Abdulhamid the Second strove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ and he ] tried to substitute the religious title of Caliph for the terms Sultan and Padi\u015fah .\nIn his general policies , religion , i.e .\nthe religion of Islam , held an important place .\nIn the curricula of the secular schools the time allotted to religious instruction was increased ; the basis of education was religious .\nReligiosity and pietism\u2013even if it were external and hypocritical\u2013 became the most important means for attracting the protection of the Caliphal favor .\nAs Muslim Tatars living in the Russian Empire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ak\u00e7ura \u2019 s mother emigrated to \u0130stanbul , turning her son into an Ottoman citizen ( in line with the official ideology of Ottomanism ) .\nAs a graduate of the Harbiye Mektebi ( War College ) , Yusuf Ak\u00e7ura became active in opposition movements to Sultan Abd\u00fclhamid \u2019 s autocratic rule and was sentenced into exile , only able to return following the so-called \u201c Young Turk \u201d or Constitutional Revolution ( \u0130lan-\u0131 H\u00fcrriyet or \u2018 Proclamation of Freedom , \u2019 forcing the sultan to reinstate the abrogated constitution , 24 July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republic as a Pan-Turkist or Turkist , Yusuf Ak\u00e7ura \u2019 s above-quoted words could in some ways very well be used to describe the AKP policy of Sunnification ( a phrase I coined in 2013 ) .\nAt the same time , Ak\u00e7ura \u2019 s assessment of the figure of Sultan Abd\u00fclhamid II would also seem quite applicable to the figure of the Prez .\nFor instance , on 12 June 2011 , the then-Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan gave one of his well-known balcony speeches on the night of his national election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that \u201c Sarajevo won today as much as Istanbul , Beirut won as much as Izmir , Damascus won as much as Ankara , Ramallah , Nablus , Jenin , the West Bank and Jerusalem won as much as Diyarbakir.\n\u201d By means of enumerating these Muslim cities beyond Turkey \u2019 s borders , Erdo\u011fan as much hinted at one-time Ottoman greatness , as at an intangible yet strong sense of Muslim solidarity binding pious ( or AKP-voting ) Turks to masses of non-Turkish believers in other political constellations and nation states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern are of course Turkish believers \u2013 Anatolian Muslims .\nIn order to get to grips with the social dynamics underlying the AKP \u2019 s political success , I would like to point towards the social transformations that took place under PM and then President Turgut \u00d6zal ( 1983/89-1993 ) \u2013 transformations that constituted the popular roots of Tayyip Erdo\u011fan \u2019 s subsequent meteoric rise .\nEarlier , I declared that \u00d6zal \u2019 s \u201c premiership in the aftermath of the 12 September Coup ushered in the official albeit somewhat surreptitious return of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d On an economic level , as a self-confessed Thatcherite , \u00d6zal was a champion of privatization but also opened the way for the ascent of the so-called \u2018 Anatolian Tigers \u2019 as a result of his economic policies , that \u201c contributed most to the emergence of Anatolian capital , \u201d as expressed by \u00d6mer Demir , Mustafa Acar and Metin Toprak These authors further note that \u201c a boom has been observed in production and capital accumulation of companies with many shareholders in Konya , Yozgat , Denizli , \u00c7orum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others after the 1980s \u201d \u2013 hence , the handy moniker of Anatolian Tigers .\nAnd these businessmen were for the most part pious Muslims as well as shrewd wheelers and dealers .\nDemir , Acar , and Toprak assert that these Anatolian \u201c business circles .\n.\n.disapprove interest and interest-based financial institutions.\n\u201d These Muslim business leaders even set up their own lobby and interest group called M\u00dcS\u0130AD ( Association of Independent Industrialists and Businessmen ) in 1990 .\nThis association was formed in opposition to the Association of Independent Industrialists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nIt might seem trivial , but the T\u00dc morphing into M\u00dc all but symbolizes that the ideology of Turkish nationalism has now been replaced by the religion of Islam in Turkey \u2019 s business world \u2013 from Turkish ( or T\u00fcrk ) entrepreneurs to Muslim ( or M\u00fcsl\u00fcman ) businessmen .\nAs long ago as 2013 , I spoke about the AKP establishment \u2019 s long-term goal , \u201c as arguably expressed in the AKP \u2019 s policy statement Hedef 2023 , [ which ] is to transform the nation state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethnicities.\n\u201d For the nominal nation state Turkey hosts a wide variety of ethnic groups within its border : in addition to a large majority of Turkish Muslims , there are also Kurds , Arabs , Lazes , Muslim Georgians , Albanians , Macedonian Muslims , Pomaks , Serbian Muslims , Bosnian Muslims , Tatars , Circassians , Abkhazians and Dagestanis among others .\nThis idealised Islamic state on Anatolian soil could then possibly even be linked to a revived caliphate and the imposition of Sharia Law .\nFor in the Republic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation \u2019 s founding father Mustafa Kemal and the Ankara government abolished Sharia law in 1926 , only to then replace the Islamic legal codex regulating human actions and social relations with the so-called Kanun-\u0131 Medini , itself a copy of the Swiss Code civil : Islam is one of the religions which puts much importance on political and social affairs .\nOne of its tenets may be formulated by the saying that \u201c religion and nation are the same.\n\u201d Islam abolishes ethnic and national loyalties of those who embrace it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their language , their past and their traditions .\nIslam is a powerful melting pot in which peoples of various ethnicities and beliefs , produces Muslims who believe they are a body with the same equal rights .\nThese words would seem quite applicable to the current state-of-affairs in Republican Turkey , but were originally written at the outset of the previous century by none other than the Tatar-turned-Turk Yusuf Ak\u00e7ura .\nThe Ottoman precept of Din \u00fc Devlet ( or \u2018 State and Religion \u2019 ) seems to have returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the Prez having turned the once-humble Directorate for Religious Affair ( or Diyanet ) \u201c into a massive organization with a huge budget , \u201d a budget that exceeds those of many ministries .\nThis year , for instance , the Diyanet \u2019 s \u201c budget .\n.\n.\nincrease [ d ] by 3.2 billion liras to 16.1 billion liras .\n.\n.\nmaking it better funded than seven ministries.\n\u201d Over the years , successive AKP governments have dismantled the Kemalist principles of the Turkish state , with nowadays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every male government employee ( or memur ) to attend the Friday Prayers .\nThe school curricula have turned state institutions into educational establishments that have quite some \u201c time allotted to religious instruction , \u201d including the teaching of Arabic under the guise of instructing Ottoman ( or Osmanl\u0131ca ) .\nAs a corollary , the huge number of Arabic-speaking refugees from Syria in the country has also given the authorities a good excuse to erect Arabic-language street signs all over the place .\nThese refugees are also served in the state-owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sa\u011fl\u0131k Merkezi or ASM ) , which have subsequently been swamped with Arabic language brochures and signs .\nThis preoccupation of Turkish Islamists has a long-standing tradition in Turkey .\nIn 1912 , for example , the historian Ahmed Refik [ Alt\u0131nay ] ( 1881-1937 ) noted that the \u201c honourable ulema [ are ] supporters of the Arabic language to an even greater degree than the Arabs [ themselves ] .\n\u201d While Ahmed Refik was criticising members of the Ottoman class of religious scholars ( the \u201c ulema \u201d ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Republican Turkey as a result of the \u201c proclamation of the Tevhid-i Tedrisat Kanunu ( Law on the Unification of Education ) , effectively abolishing the institution of the medrese [ Islamic college ] , on 3 March 1924.\n\u201d Nowadays , Turkish Islamists easily outdo the erstwhile ulema in their zeal for the Arabic language and the Arabic script .\nAlas , these lofty concerns of the country \u2019 s AKP leadership have now encountered an insidious enemy in the form of a failing economy and rampant inflation : \u201c the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turkey , Atilla Ye\u015filada quite openly speaks about the blatant economic mismanagement of the country by the AKP government and he does not shy away from laying the blame directly at the feet of none other than the Prez himself.\n\u201d The economic researcher and one of the founders of the Association of Kurdish Economists in Syria , Khursheed Alika , on the other hand , also believes that \u201c the Turkish currency will continue to decline unless the interest rate is raised in line with inflation rates and the markets calm down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over markets and prices is increased .\nTherefore , the central bank \u2019 s failure to raise the interest rate and the policy followed by Turkey to launch a military operation against the Kurds in north and northeastern Syria put pressure on the Turkish lira , and the rise in energy , goods and services prices as a result of the Russian-Ukrainian war casts a shadow over the continuous decline of the Turkish lira in light of the useless policy of palliatives pursued by the Turkish government.\n\u201d For the Prez is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usury and abhors the principle of interest , which is arguably why he is so keen to pursue his own personal whims when it comes to monetary policy .\nInstead , Tayyip Erdo\u011fanand his AKP government persist in putting mind over matter , while actively prospecting for oil , gas and even rare earths underneath Turkey \u2019 s soil or hidden beneath Mediterranean waters : \u201c Turkey may deploy its new drill ship Abdulhamid Han in the Mediterranean Sea , a move that could reignite political and military tensions with Greece and Cyprus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather desperate attempts to discover valuable energy resources ( and sources of income ) are nothing but hare-brained schemes meant to secure a quick fix ( or divinely inspired miracle , if you will ) for the the woes and troubles of the Turkish people .\n.\n.\nwho are getting ready to cast their ballots in next year \u2019 s general elections .\nAnd , make no mistake , Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and the AKP establishment feel that they have to win these elections in order to achieve their very own Hedef 2023 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their practical goals and targets \u2013 practical goals and targets that are but prerequisites for achieving the unspoken aim of the transformation of the Turkish nation into a state once again beholden to the religion of Islam and regulated by Sharia law on the centenary of the

speed cameras to extort many millions of dollars from members of the public , some cities in America are now revisiting the concept .\nIn Chicago , local officials are wrestling with whether speed cameras have improved traffic safety enough to justify their massive financial burden on the city \u2019 s poorest motorists .\nEvery must now demand this level of transparency for cash-grabbing speed cameras in your local area , wherever you are\u2026 As Chicago \u2019 s City Council debates whether to rein in a controversial expansion of the city \u2019 s speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrestling with whether the devices have improved traffic safety enough to justify their financial burden on Black and Latino motorists .\nIt \u2019 s a difficult , complex question , and it comes at a moment when the city has witnessed a series of high-profile fatal traffic crashes \u2014 including several involving children .\nIn this context , Mayor Lori Lightfoot is defending her policy lowering the threshold for speeding tickets from 10 mph over the limit to 6 .\nThe lowered threshold , which comes with $ 35 tickets and went into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring in some $ 40 million to $ 45 million in revenue this year .\n( Previously , the city issued $ 35 tickets to motorists caught speeding 10 mph over the limit and $ 100 tickets for those caught at higher speeds . )\nThe City Council is

move was a cash grab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who can least afford it .\nLightfoot and those who support maintaining the lowered threshold say they are motivated by safety .\nProPublica \u2019 s reporting has helped inform the debate .\nSince 2018 , we have reported on how Chicago \u2019 s ticketing system \u2014 including parking , compliance and automated red-light and speed camera citations \u2014 disproportionately hurt Black motorists , sending tens of thousands into bankruptcy .\nIn January , we reported on how households in Black and Latino ZIP codes received camera tickets at about twice the rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporting was primarily based on an analysis of data on red-light and speed camera citations issued between 2015 and 2019 , but we also examined tickets issued to motorists

differences that seem to contribute to the disparities in ticketing , such as wider streets with more lanes that lend themselves to speeding in areas with higher proportions of Black and Latino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Illinois at Chicago released in January found similar racial disparities in camera ticketing in addition to a greater financial burden from late penalties on households in low-income Black

rebound and supercharges mutations \u2022 None The U.S. had thrown away 82.2 million expired COVID jab doses as of mid-May 2022 , yet the Biden administration ordered another 105 million doses at the end of June 2022 for a fall booster campaign that will cost taxpayers $ 3.2 billion \u2022 None Pfizer \u2019 s contracts are almost exclusively slanted in Pfizer \u2019 s favor .\nThey \u2019 re guaranteed payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deaths , and it appears this indemnification applies even if they were to be found guilty of fraud Corporativism : Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla has used the Covid crisis to accumulate unprecedented wealth and power over corrupt government policies makers .\nAccording to Kaiser Health News ( KHN ) ,1 the COVID-19 pandemic has been a real boon to Pfizer .\nNot only has it yielded \u201c outsize benefits \u201d in terms of profits , but it has also \u201c given the drugmaker unusual weight in determining U.S. health policy.\n\u201d \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s executives have frequently announced the next stage in the fight against the pandemic before government officials have had time to study the issue , annoying many experts in the medical field and leaving some patients unsure whom to trust , \u201d KHN reporter Arthur Allen writes , adding:2 \u201c When last year Bourla suggested that a booster shot would soon be needed , U.S. public health officials later followed , giving the impression that Pfizer was calling the tune .\nSome public health experts and scientists worry these decisions were hasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although boosters with the mRNA shots produced by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech improve antibody protection initially , it generally doesn \u2019 t last .\nSince January , Bourla has been saying that U.S. adults will probably all need annual booster shots , and senior FDA officials have indicated since April that they agree \u2026 The company \u2019 s power worries some vaccinologists , who see its growing influence in a realm of medical decision-making traditionally led by independent experts \u2026 When President Biden in September 2021 offered boosters to Americans \u2014 not long after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommended them \u2014 Dr. Paul Offit , director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children \u2019 s Hospital of Philadelphia \u2026 wondered , \u2018 Where \u2019 s the evidence you are at risk of serious disease when confronted with COVID if you are vaccinated and under 50 ?\n\u2019 Policies on booster recommendations for different groups are complex and shifting , Offit said , but the CDC , rather than Bourla and Pfizer , should be making them .\n\u2018 We \u2019 re being pushed along , \u2019 he said .\n\u2018 The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies.\n\u2019 \u201d The fact that a vaccine-pusher like Offit \u2014 infamous for claiming a baby can safely tolerate 10,000 vaccines at once3 \u2014 is questioning and pushing back against Pfizer \u2019 s influence over health policy reveals just how brazen , unethical and potentially dangerous that is .\nAccording to Allen , Pfizer \u2019 s revenue in 2021 was $ 81.3 billion4 \u2014 approximately double that of 2020 \u2014 and the COVID shot accounted for $ 36.78 billion5 of that .\nFor comparison , Lipitor , Pfizer \u2019 s previous top selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year,6 while their strep vaccine , Prevnar 13 rakes in $ 6 billion a year.7 Its mRNA gene transfer injection against COVID now dominates 70 % of the U.S. and European markets , and Paxlovid , Pfizer \u2019 s COVID drug , has become a standard treatment choice in hospitals .\nThis , despite researchers finding Paxlovid ( molnupiravir ) causes severe rebound and supercharges mutations .\nIn a rational scenario , that finding would have put a stop to its use , but no .\nIn an official health advisory8 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2022 , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first warns that Paxlovid is associated with \u201c recurrence of COVID-19 or \u2018 COVID-19 rebound , \u2019 \u201d and then in the very next sentence stresses in bold print a narrative supporting its use and enriching Pfizer with instructions saying : Allen also notes that , during an investor call , a Pfizer official highlighted reports of Paxlovid \u2019 s failure , but spun it into \u201c good news \u201d for investors , as patients may require multiple courses !\n9 Obviously the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humans to raping them for as much profit as possible .\nSimilarly , while Pfizer \u2019 s COVID jab clearly doesn \u2019 t prevent infection or spread , and Americans are rejecting the shots in growing numbers \u2014 82.2 million doses had expired and were chucked in the trash as of mid-May 202210 \u2014 the U.S. government still went ahead and ordered another 105 million doses at the end of June 2022 .\nThese are intended for a fall booster campaign , at a cost to taxpayers of $ 3.2 billion.11 The U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for each of these new jab boosters this time around \u2014 $ 30.47 per dose compared to $ 19.50 per dose paid for the first 100 million doses .\nThe U.S. government has also promised to purchase another 20 million courses of Paxlovid , at an eye-watering cost of $ 530 per five-day course .\nBasically , Pfizer is being financially rewarded for producing products that are useless at best and dangerous at worst , and we \u2019 re all paying for it .\nIn case you \u2019 re curious , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxpayers to Pfizer .\nAfter you likely thought it couldn \u2019 t ever get any worse , KHN also touches on , but doesn \u2019 t delve into , the fact that Pfizer suggested they skip human trials as they move forward with jabs that are reformulated for newer variants .\nIf this strikes you as crazy , you \u2019 d be right .\nIt \u2019 s sheer madness , but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \u2014 a clearly captured agency \u2014 has already surreptitiously agreed to this egregious miscarriage of science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the \u201c Future Framework , \u201d 12 was adopted by the FDA without formal vote is explained by Toby Rogers , Ph.D. \u2014 a political economist whose research focus is on regulatory capture and Big Pharma corruption13 \u2014 in the video above .\nHe also explained it in a June 29 , 2022 , Substack article:14 \u201c Yesterday [ June 28 ] , the FDA \u2019 s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee approved a bivalent COVID-19 shot with the Wuhan strain and the Omicron variant \u2026 Wait , hold up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Future Framework yesterday The policy question was whether reformulated COVID-19 shots would be treated as new molecular entities ( which they are ) in which case they should be subject to formal review or whether reformulated shots would be treated as \u2018 biologically similar \u2019 to existing Covid-19 shots and be allowed to skip clinical trials altogether .\nApparently the FDA did not have the votes to just pass this as a policy question .\nIf you ask anyone whether reformulated mRNA represents a new molecular entity , well of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal regulatory review .\nWhat the FDA did instead was to smuggle the policy question in disguised as a vote about reformulated \u2018 boosters \u2019 for the fall .\nIn essence , the FDA just started doing the Future Framework ( picking variants willy nilly , skipping clinical trials ) and essentially dared the committee members to turn down a booster dose \u2014 knowing that all of the VRBPAC members are hand-picked because they \u2019 ve never met a vaccine they did not like .\nSo of course only two people on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a booster dose \u2014 even though it was based on this preposterous process ( that was never formally adopted ) where there was literally no data at all \u2026 By stealth , the FDA replaced a system based on evidence with a system based entirely on belief.\n\u201d In 2021 , secret details of Pfizer \u2019 s contracts came to light , showing they are essentially holding countries hostage to nonnegotiable demands for payment in full AND freedom from liability.15 In late February 2021 , The Bureau of Investigative Journalism reported16 that Pfizer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as collateral for expected vaccine injury lawsuits resulting from its COVID-19 jab .\nSeveral countries , including Brazil , Chile , Colombia , the Dominican Republic and Peru , agreed to this demand , putting up bank reserves , military bases and embassy buildings as collateral .\nIn short , theses governments are guaranteeing Pfizer will be compensated for any expenses resulting from injury lawsuits against it , so the company won \u2019 t lose a dime if its COVID shot injures people .\nShockingly , these terms are binding even if those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practices , fraud or malice

Marie Newman put it , \u201c free to live as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Trans Bill of Rights guts protections and programs for biological women .\nEvery American must now decide : do I support this vision of trans rights , or do I stand for women \u2019 s rights ?\nIt is impossible to support both because they are in direct conflict .\nThe press materials promoting the Trans Bill of Rights focus on the idea of inclusivity , personal fulfillment , and preventing the bullying and mistreatment of LGBTQ+ and gender-nonconforming communities , all of which sounds very nice .\nOf course , Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindness and respect .\nBut the Trans Bill of Rights isn \u2019 t just a feel-good statement of support or warning against bullying .\nIt has serious legal implications \u2014 particularly for women .\nThe Trans Bill of Rights would redefine the term \u201c sex \u201d under the Civil Rights Act to include \u201c gender identity and sex characteristics \u201d and prohibit public accommodations and federally funded programs from offering spaces and programs exclusively for women .\nIn other words , it would become illegal to take into account sex or \u201c sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cease to exist .\nIf a female athletic team can not discriminate against males , then men will dominate competitions meant for women .\nIf women \u2019 s locker rooms , rape crisis centers , and domestic violence shelters are required to take in men , women \u2019 s privacy and security will be compromised .\nIf men are allowed to opt in to women \u2019 s prisons , then female prisoners will face physical harm .\nWe already see this happening today .\nFemale athletes around the country are being forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swimmer Lia Thomas is the most notorious example , with the NCAA just last week selecting Lia as the \u201c female athlete of the year.\n\u201d That was a slap in the face to all female swimmers who have spent their lives training and competing without the benefits of testosterone and having undergone puberty as a male , which creates lasting physical advantages , including greater height , bone mass , lung capacity , and more .\nYet this phenomenon goes far beyond one swimmer .\nMale-bodied athletes are competing \u2014 and often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skateboarding , weightlifting , fighting sports , volleyball , and more .\nThe Trans Bill of Rights would accelerate this trend by forbidding the taking of sex into account entirely so that any man \u2014 not just men who identify as women \u2014 could choose to compete in women \u2019 s sports , apply for an engineering scholarship meant for a woman , enter a female prison , or choose to undress in a women \u2019 s locker room .\nSingle-sex facilities would disappear .\nThe Trans Bill of Rights \u2019 erasure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women equally .\nNo one worries about allowing biological women to enter men \u2019 s sports .\nNo one is concerned about the physical safety of male prisoners faced with a biological female , or women using a male changing room .\nWomen who are physically weaker , more vulnerable to assault , and who have historically suffered from discrimination alone would pay the price .\nAmericans can make a different choice and reject the Trans Bill of Rights \u2019 radical , anti-woman agenda .\nThe Women \u2019 s Bill of Rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and supported by a bipartisan coalition of women \u2019 s organizations and advocates \u2014 stops the assault on women and single-sex institutions .\nIt clarifies the definition of terms like \u201c female \u201d and \u201c women \u201d under existing law as based in biology and affirms that there are circumstances in which single-sex is not only legal , but necessary .\nThe Women \u2019 s Bill of Rights would not prevent the adoption of protections for transgender and nonbinary people .\nAccommodations can be made in athletics , prison systems , education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be achieved by erasing women as a matter of law as would be done by the Trans Bill of Rights .\nOne can not be for both women \u2019 s rights and this vision of trans rights .\nOne can not stand up for women without knowing what the term woman means .\nAmericans know what a woman is , what a female is , and what a mother is .\nOur laws should too .", "author": "NEWS WIRE", "url":

SARS Covid virus that publicly emerged in 2019 is that the medical specialization of virology has been raised to a stature almost Godlike in the media .\nFew understand the origins of virology and its elevation into a leading role in today \u2019 s medicine practice .\nFor this we need to look at the origins and politics of America \u2019 s first medical research institute , the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research , today Rockefeller University , and their work on what they claimed was a polio virus .\nIn 1907 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York City gave the director of the Rockefeller Institute , Simon Flexner , MD , a golden opportunity to lay claim to discovery of an invisible \u201c virus \u201d caused by what was arbitrarily called poliomyelitis .\nThe word poliomyelitis simply means inflammation of the spinal cord \u2019 s grey matter .\nThere were some 2,500 New Yorkers , mostly children , designated with some form of poliomyelitis , including paralysis and even death , that year .\nThe most striking aspect of the entire polio saga in the USA during the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that every key phase of the business was controlled by people tied to what became the Rockefeller medical cabal .\nThis fraud started with claims by the Director of the Rockefeller Institute , Simon Flexner , that he and his colleague , Paul A. Lewis , had \u201c isolated \u201d a pathogen , invisible to the eye , smaller even than bacteria , which they claimed caused the paralyzing sickness in a series of outbreaks in the US .\nHow did they come to this idea ?\nIn a paper published in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medical Association , Flexner claimed he and Lewis had isolated the poliomyelitis virus responsible .\nHe reported they had successfully \u201c passaged \u201d poliomyelitis through several monkeys , from monkey to monkey .\nThey began by injecting diseased human spinal cord tissue of a young boy who had died , presumably from the virus , into the brains of monkeys .\nAfter a monkey fell ill , a suspension of its diseased spinal cord tissue was injected into the brains of other monkeys who also fell ill .\nThey proclaimed that the Rockefeller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causality for the mysterious disease .\nThey hadn \u2019 t done anything of the sort .\nFlexner and Lewis even admitted that : \u201c We failed utterly to discover bacteria , either in film preparations or in cultures , that could account for the disease ; and , since among our long series of propagations of the virus in monkeys not one animal showed , in the lesions , the cocci described by some previous investigators , and we had failed to obtain any such bacteria from the human material studied by us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excluded from consideration.\n\u201d What they then did was to make a bizarre supposition , a leap of faith , not a scientific claim .\nThey took their hypothesis of viral exogenous agency and made it fact , with no proof whatever .\nThey asserted : \u201c Therefore , \u2026the infecting agent of epidemic poliomyelitis belongs to the class of the minute and filterable viruses that have not thus far been demonstrated with certainty under the microscope.\n\u201c Therefore ?\nSimon Flexner simply asserted it \u201c must \u201d be a polio virus killing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no other explanation .\nIn fact , he did not look for another source of the illnesses .\nThis was not scientific isolation .\nIt was wild speculation : \u201c \u2026not thus far been demonstrated with certainty under the microscope.\n\u201d They admitted this in a December 18 , 1909 follow up in JAMA , titled , THE NATURE OF THE VIRUS OF EPIDEMIC POLIOMYELITIS .\nThe so-called \u201c virus \u201d they were injecting into monkeys was hardly pure .\nIt also contained an undetermined amount of contaminants .\nIt included \u201c pureed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even flies were ground up and injected into monkeys to induce paralysis.\n\u201d Until Jonas Salk won approval from the US Government in April 1955 for a polio vaccine , no scientific proof of existence of a virus causing poliomyelitis , or infantile paralysis as it was commonly known , had been proven .\nThat is the case to this day .\nThe medical world all took Flexner \u2019 s word that it \u201c must \u201d be a virus .\nThe Rockefeller Institute was founded from the Standard Oil fortune of John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America \u2019 s first biomedical institute .\nIt was modelled on France \u2019 s Pasteur Institute ( 1888 ) and Germany \u2019 s Robert Koch Institute ( 1891 ) .\nIts first Director , Simon Flexner , played a pivotal and most criminal role in the evolution of what became approved American medical practice .\nThe Rockefeller goal was to completely control American medical practice and transform it into an instrument , at least initially , for promotion of medical drugs approved by the Rockefeller interests .\nBy then they were looking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refining , as they had done with oil .\nAs Rockefeller Institute head , Simon Flexner , was publishing his inconclusive but highly acclaimed studies on polio , he arranged for his brother , Abraham Flexner , a school teacher with no medical background , to head a joint study by the American Medical Association ( AMA ) , the Rockefeller General Education Board , and the Carnegie Foundation founded by Rockefeller \u2019 s close friend Andrew Carnegie .\nThe 1910 study was titled , The Flexner Report , and its ostensible purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US medical schools .\nThe outcome of the report was , however , predetermined .\nTies between the well-endowed Rockefeller Institute and the AMA went through the corrupt AMA head , George H. Simmons .\nSimmons was also the editor of the influential Journal of the American Medical Association , a publication delivered to some 80,000 doctors across America .\nHe reportedly wielded absolute power over the doctors \u2019 association .\nHe controlled the rising ad revenues for drug companies to promote their drugs to AMA doctors in his journal , a highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the Rockefeller medical coup that was to completely redefine acceptable medical practice away from remedial or preventive treatment to use of often deadly drugs and expensive surgeries .\nAs head of the AMA Simmons realized that the competition from a proliferation of medical schools , including then-recognized chiropractic , osteopathy , homeopathy and natural medicine , was lessening income of his AMA doctors , as the number of medical schools had increased from around 90 in 1880 to over 150 in 1903 .\nAbraham Flexner , former headmaster of a private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1909 and recommended that fully half of the 165 medical schools be closed , as what he defined as \u201c sub-standard.\n\u201d This reduced competition from other approaches to healing diseases .\nThey ruthlessly targeted then-widespread naturopathic medical schools , chiropractic ones , osteopaths as well as independent allopathic schools unwilling to join the AMA regime .\nThen Rockefeller money went to the select schools with a proviso that professors be vetted by the Rockefeller Institute and the curriculum focus on drugs and surgery as treatment , not prevention , nor nutrition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solutions .\nThey had to accept Pasteur \u2019 s germ theory of disease , which claims one germ to one disease reductionism .\nRockefeller-controlled media launched a coordinated witch-hunt against all forms of alternative medicine , herbal remedies , natural vitamins and chiropractic\u2013anything not controlled by Rockefeller patented drugs .\nBy 1919 the Rockefeller General Education Board and the Rockefeller Foundation had paid out more than $ 5,000,000 to Johns Hopkins , Yale and Washington University in St. Louis medical schools .\nIn 1919 John D. Rockefeller granted another $ 20,000,000 in securities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education in the United States.\n\u201d That would be comparable to about $ 340 million today , a huge sum .\nIn short the Rockefeller money interests had hijacked American medical education and medical research by the 1920 \u2019 s .\nThis medical takeover , backed by the most influential doctors \u2019 organization , the AMA , and its corrupt head , Simmons , allowed Simon Flexner to literally create modern virology under Rockefeller rules .\nThe highly controversial Thomas Milton Rivers , as director of The Rockefeller Institute \u2019 s virology laboratory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , separate from bacteriology , during the 1920s .\nThey realized they could manipulate far easier when they could claim deadly pathogens that were invisible germs or \u201c viruses.\n\u201d Ironically virus comes from Latin for poison .\nVirology , a reductionist medical fraud , was a creation of the Rockefeller medical cabal .\nThat highly important fact is buried in the annals of medicine today .\nDiseases such as smallpox or measles or poliomyelitis were declared caused by invisible pathogens called specific viruses .\nIf scientists could \u201c isolate \u201d the invisible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect people from harm .\nSo their theory went .\nIt was a huge boon for the Rockefeller cartel of pharmaceutical companies , which at the time included American Home Products which falsely promoted drugs with no proof of effect , such as Preparation H for Hemorrhoids , or Advil for pain relief ; Sterling Drug , which took over the US assets including Aspirin of German Bayer AG after World War I ; Winthrop Chemical ; American Cyanamid and its subsidiary Lederle Laboratories ; Squibb and Monsanto .\nSoon virus researchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to claiming discovery of the poliomyelitis virus , claimed to discover the viruses that caused smallpox , mumps , measles and yellow fever .\nThen they announced \u201c discovery \u201d of preventive vaccines for pneumonia and yellow fever .\nAll of these \u201c discoveries \u201d announced by the Institute proved false .\nWith the control of the research in the new area of virology , the Rockefeller Institute , in collusion with Simmons at AMA and his equally corrupt successor , Morris Fishbein , could promote new patented vaccines or drug \u201c remedies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to every member doctor in America .\nDrug companies refusing to pay for ads in the AMA journal were blackballed by the AMA .\nSimon Flexner and the highly-influential Rockefeller Institute succeeded in 1911 in having the symptoms that were being called poliomyelitis to be entered into the US Public Health Law as a \u201c contagious , infectious disease caused by an air-borne virus.\n\u201d Yet even they admitted they had not proven how the disease enters the body of humans .\nAs one experienced doctor pointed out in a medical journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the possible methods of contagion is based almost entirely upon the work done in this city at the Rockefeller Institute.\n\u201d In 1951 Dr. Ralph Scobey , a critic of the Rockefeller rush to judgment on polio contagion , noted , \u201c This of course placed reliance on animal experiments rather than on clinical investigations\u2026 \u201d Scobey also pointed to the lack of proof poliomyelitis was contagious : \u201c \u2026children afflicted with the disease were kept in general hospital wards and that not a single one of the other inmates of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disease.\n\u201d The general attitude at that time was summed up in 1911 : \u201c It seems to us despite the lack of absolute proof , that the best interests of the community would be conserved by our regarding the disease from a contagious standpoint.\n\u201d ( sic ) .\nBy having poliomyelitis symptoms classified as a highly contagious disease caused by an invisible , alleged exogenous or external virus , the Rockefeller Institute and the AMA were able to cut off any serious research for alternative explanations such as exposure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain the seasonal outbreaks of illness and paralysis , even death , mostly in very young children .\nThat was to have fatal consequences lasting to the present .\nIn his 1952 statement to the US House of Representatives investigating the possible dangers of chemicals in food products , Ralph R. Scobey , M.D .\nnoted , \u201c For almost half a century poliomyelitis investigations have been directed towards a supposed exogenous virus that enters the human body to cause the disease .\nThe manner in which the Public Health Law is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation .\nNo intensive studies have been made , on the other hand , to determine whether or not the so-called virus of poliomyelitis is an autochthonous chemical substance that does not enter the human body at all , but simply results from an exogenous factor or factors , for example , a food poison.\n\u201d Toxins as cause were not investigated , despite huge evidence .\nDuring the 1930s with economic depression and then war , few new major outbreaks of poliomyelitis were noted .\nHowever , immediately after the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polio drama exploded in dimension .\nBeginning 1945 , every summer more and more children across America were diagnosed with poliomyelitis and hospitalized .\nLess than 1 % of the cases were actually tested via blood or urine tests .\nSome 99 % were diagnosed by merely the presence of symptoms such as acute pain in extremities , fever , upset stomach , diarrhea .\nIn 1938 , with the support of presumed polio victim , Franklin D. Roosevelt , the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis ( March of Dimes ) was founded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research .\nA German doctor and researcher , Dr Henry Kumm , came to the US and joined the Rockefeller Institute in 1928 where he stayed until joining the National Foundation in 1951 as Director of Polio Research .\nKumm was joined at the National Foundation by another key Rockefeller Institute veteran , the so-called \u201c father of virology , \u201d Thomas M. Rivers , who chaired the foundation \u2019 s vaccine research advisory committee overseeing the research of Jonas Salk .\nThese two Rockefeller Institute key figures thus controlled funds for polio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Second World War , while still at Rockefeller Institute , Henry Kumm was a consultant to the US Army where he oversaw field studies in Italy .\nThere Kumm directed field studies for the use of DDT against typhus and malarial mosquitoes in the marshes near Rome and Naples .\nDDT had been patented as an insecticide by Swiss drug firm Geigy and their US branch in 1940 , and first authorized for use on US Army soldiers in 1943 as a general disinfectant against head lice , mosquitoes and many other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost all DDT production in the US went to the military .\nIn 1945 the chemical companies looked eagerly for new markets .\nThey found them .\nIn early 1944 , US newspapers triumphantly reported that typhus , \u201c the dreaded plague that has followed in the wake of every great war in history , \u201d was no longer a threat to American troops and their allies thanks to the army \u2019 s new \u201c louse-killing \u201d powder , DDT .\nIn an experiment in Naples , American soldiers dusted more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ! )\n, killing the body lice that spread typhus .\nRockefeller Institute \u2019 s Henry Kumm and the US Army knew that , as one researcher put it , \u201c DDT was a poison , but it was safe enough for war .\nAny person harmed by DDT would be an accepted casualty of combat.\n\u201d The US Government \u201c restricted \u201d a report on insecticides issued by the Office of Scientific Research and Development in 1944 that warned against the cumulative toxic effects of DDT in humans and animals .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ article , \u201c As DDT is a cumulative poison , it is inevitable that large-scale intoxication of the American population would occur .\nIn 1944 , Smith and Stohlman of the National Institutes of Health , after an extensive study of the cumulative toxicity of DDT , pointed out , \u201c The toxicity of DDT combined with its cumulative action and absorbability from the skin places a definite health hazard on its use.\n\u201d Their warnings were ignored by higher officials .\nInstead , after 1945 , all across America DDT was promoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d pesticide , much like Monsanto \u2019 s Roundup with glyphosate three decades later .\nDDT was said to be harmless to humans .\nBut no one in government was seriously scientifically testing that claim .\nOne year later in 1945 as the war ended , US newspapers praised the new DDT as a \u201c magic \u201d substance , a \u201c miracle.\n\u201d Time called DDT \u201c one of the great scientific discoveries of World War II.\n\u201d Despite isolated warnings of untested side effects , that it was a persistent , toxic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chain , the US Government approved DDT for general use in 1945 .\nThe Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) , controlled by the Rockefeller-AMA-drug interests , established as \u201c safe \u201d a DDT content of up to 7 parts per million in foods , though no one had proven such .\nThe DDT chemical companies fed the press with photos and anecdotes .\nNewspapers enthusiastically reported how the new miracle chemical , DDT , was being tested in the US against mosquitoes in the South believed carrying malaria , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia orchards , Oregon potato fields , Illinois cornfields , and Iowa dairies.\n\u201d DDT was everywhere in the USA in the late 1940s .\nThe US Government claimed DDT , unlike arsenic and other insecticides used before the war , was harmless to humans , even infants , and could be used liberally .\nBeginning 1945 cities like Chicago sprayed public beaches , parks , swimming pools .\nHousewives bought home aerosol spray DDT dispensers to spray the kitchen and especially childrens \u2019 rooms , even their matrasses .\nFarmers were told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially dairy cows , with DDT .\nIn postwar America DDT was being promoted , above all by Rockefeller drug companies like American Home Products with its Black Flag aerosol DDT spray , and Monsanto .\nFrom 1945 through 1952 the US production of DDT increased tenfold .\nAs presumed cases of polio literally exploded across the USA after 1945 the theory was advanced , with no proof , that the crippling polio disease was transmitted , not by toxic pesticide chemicals like DDT , but by mosquitoes or flies to humans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe message was that DDT can safely protect your family from the crippling polio .\nOfficially listed polio cases went from some 25,000 in 1943 before US civilian use of DDT , to over 280,000 cases in 1952 at the peak , more than a tenfold increase .\nIn October 1945 , DDT , which had been used by the US Army under supervision of Rockefeller Institute \u2019 s Henry Kumm as noted , was authorized by the US Government for general use as an insecticide against mosquitoes and flies .\nDissenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in humans and animals were silenced .\nFamilies were told DDT could save their children from the dreaded polio by killing the feared insects .\nThe US Department of Agriculture advised farmers to wash their dairy cows with a solution of DDT to combat mosquitoes and flies .\nCornfields were aerial sprayed with DDT as well as fruit orchards .\nHowever , it was incredibly persistent and its toxic effect on plants and vegetables were such it could not be washed off .\nYear-by-year from 1945 through 1952 the amount of DDT sprayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so too did the number of human cases of poliomyelitis .\nBy the beginning of the 1950s increasing attention was given in the US Congress and among farmers as to the possible dangers of such heavy pesticide use\u2014not only DDT , but also the even more toxic BHC ( benzene hexachloride ) .\nIn 1951 , Morton Biskind , a physician who had successfully treated several hundred patients with DDT poisoning , testified to the US House of Representatives on the possible link of paralytic polio to toxins , specifically DDT and BHC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Congress in late 1950 , \u201c Early last year I published a series of observations on DDT poisoning in man .\nSince shortly after the last war a large number of cases had been observed by physicians all over the country in which a group of symptoms occurred , the most prominent feature of which was gastroenteritis , persistently recurrent nervous symptoms , and extreme muscular weakness\u2026 \u201d He described several case examples of patients whose severe symptoms including paralysis disappeared when exposure to DDT and related toxins was eliminated : \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases which I reported early last year has since been considerably extended .\nMy subsequent observations have not only confirmed the view that DDT is responsible for a great deal of otherwise inexplicable human disability\u2026 \u201d Also noted was the fact that polio cases were always most in summer months when DDT spraying against insects was maximum .\nThe Rockefeller Institute operatives and the AMA , via their agents in the US Government , created the 1946-1952 USA health emergency called polio .\nThey did so by knowingly promoting the highly toxic DDT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mythical insect spreaders of the feared disease .\nTheir propaganda campaign convinced the American population that DDT was the key to stop spread of poliomyelitis .\nUnder leadership of the two Rockefeller Institute doctors , Henry Kumm and Thomas Rivers , the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis ( NFIP ) rejected critics such as Biskind and Scobey .\nNatural remedial treatment , such as using intravenous Vitamin C for the infantile paralysis , were rejected out of hand as \u201c quackery.\n\u201d In April 1953 , leading Rockefeller Institute DDT consultant , Dr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Research for NFIP .\nHe funded the polio vaccine research of Jonas Salk .\nOne courageous doctor in North Carolina , Dr. Fred R.

of reaching a worldwide goal of \u201c net zero carbon \u201d by 2050 .\nThis for most sounds far in the future and hence largely ignored .\nYet transformations underway from Germany to the USA , to countless other economies , are setting the stage for creation of what in the 1970 \u2019 s was called the New International Economic Order .\nIn reality , it is a blueprint for a global technocratic totalitarian corporativism , one that promises huge unemployment , deindustrialization and economic collapse by design .\nConsider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Economic Forum ( WEF ) is currently promoting his favorite theme , the Great Reset of the world economy .\nThe key to it all is understanding what the globalists mean by Net Zero Carbon by 2050 .\nThe EU is leading the race , with a bold plan to become the world \u2019 s first \u201c carbon neutral \u201d continent by 2050 and reduce its CO2 emissions by at least 55 % by 2030 .\nIn an August , 2020 post on his blog , self-appointed global vaccine czar Bill Gates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : \u201c As awful as this pandemic is , climate change could be worse\u2026 The relatively small decline in emissions this year makes one thing clear : We can not get to zero emissions simply\u2014or even mostly\u2014by flying and driving less.\n\u201d With a virtual monopoly on mainstream media as well as social media , the Global Warming lobby has been able to lead much of the world into assuming that the best for mankind is to eliminate hydrocarbons including petroleum , natural gas , coal and even the \u201c carbon free \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopefully might avoid a 1.5 to 2 degree Centigrade rise in average world temperature .\nThere is only one problem with this .\nIt \u2019 s cover for a diabolical ulterior agenda .\nMany have forgotten the original scientific thesis put forward to justify a radical shift in our energy sources .\nIt was not \u201c climate change.\n\u201d Earth climate is constantly changing , correlated to changes in the emission of solar flares or sunspot cycles affecting Earth climate .\nAround the turn of the millennium as the previous solar-led warming cycle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others shifted the narrative in a linguistic sleight-of-hand to \u201c Climate Change , \u201d from Global Warming .\nNow the fear narrative has gotten so absurd that every freak weather event is treated as \u201c climate crisis.\n\u201d Every hurricane or winter storm is claimed as proof that the Climate Gods are punishing us sinful CO2 emitting humans .\nBut wait .\nThe entire reason for the transition to alternative energy sources such as solar or wind , and abandoning carbon energy sources , is their claim that CO2 is a greenhouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphere where it forms a blanket that supposedly warms the Earth below\u2014Global Warming .\nGreenhouse gas emissions according to the US Environmental Protection Agency come mostly from CO2 .\nHence the focus on \u201c carbon footprints.\n\u201d What is almost never said is that CO2 can not soar up into the atmosphere from car exhaust or coal plants or other manmade origins .\nCarbon dioxide is not carbon or soot .\nIt is an invisible , odorless gas essential to plant photosynthesis and all life forms on earth , including us .\nCO2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 44 while air ( mainly oxygen and nitrogen ) has a molecular weight of only 29 .\nThe specific gravity of CO2 is some 1.5 times greater than air .\nThat would suggest that CO2 exhaust gases from vehicles or power plants do not rise into the atmosphere some 12 miles or more above Earth to form the feared greenhouse effect .\nTo appreciate what criminal action is unfolding today around Gates , Schwab and advocates of an alleged \u201c sustainable \u201d world economy , we must go back to 1968 when David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea that human consumption and population growth were the major world problem .\nRockefeller , whose wealth was based on oil , created the neo-Malthusian Club of Rome at the Rockefeller villa in Bellagio , Italy .\nTheir first project was to fund a junk study at MIT called Limits to Growth in 1972 .\nA key organizer of Rockefeller \u2019 s \u2018 zero growth \u2019 agenda in the early 1970s was his longtime friend , a Canadian oilman named Maurice Strong , also a Club of Rome member .\nIn 1971 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nations and Secretary General of the June 1972 Stockholm Earth Day conference .\nHe was also a trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation .\nMaurice Strong was a key early propagator of the scientifically unfounded theory that man-made emissions from transportation vehicles , coal plants and agriculture caused a dramatic and accelerating global temperature rise which threatens civilization , so-called Global Warming .\nHe invented the elastic term \u201c sustainable development.\n\u201d As chairman of the 1972 Earth Day UN Stockholm Conference , Strong promoted population reduction and lowering of living standards around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some years later the same Strong stated : This is the agenda today known as the Great Reset or UN Agenda 2030 .\nStrong went on to create the UN Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , a political body which advances the unproven claim that manmade CO2 emissions were about to tip our world into irreversible ecological catastrophe .\nCo-founder of the Club of Rome , Dr Alexander King , admitted the essential fraud of their environmental agenda some years later in his book , The First Global Revolution .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c threat of global warming \u201d was merely a ploy to justify an attack on \u201c humanity itself.\n\u201d This is now is being rolled out as the Great Reset and the Net Zero Carbon ruse .\nIn 2011 , acting on the advice of Joachim Schnellnhuber , of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research ( PIK ) , Angela Merkel and the German government imposed a total ban on nuclear electricity by 2022 , as part of a 2001 government strategy called the Energiewende or Energy Turn , to rely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d The aim was to make Germany the first industrial nation to be \u201c carbon neutral.\n\u201d The strategy has been an economic catastrophe .\nGoing from having one of the industrial world \u2019 s most stable low-cost and reliable electric generation grids , today Germany has become the world \u2019 s most expensive electric generator .\nAccording to the German energy industry association BDEW , at the latest by 2023 when the last nuclear plant closes , Germany will face electricity shortfalls .\nAt the same time coal , the largest source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to reach Net Zero Carbon .\nTraditional energy-intensive industries such as steel , glass production , basic chemicals , paper and cement manufacturing , are facing soaring costs and shutdowns or offshoring and loss of millions of skilled jobs .\nThe energy inefficient wind and solar , today costs some 7 to 9 times more than gas .\nGermany has little sun compared with tropical countries , so wind is seen as the major source for green power .\nThere is a huge input of concrete and aluminum needed to produce solar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy\u2014gas or coal or nuclear\u2014to produce .\nAs that is phased out , cost becomes prohibitive , even with no added \u201c carbon taxes.\n\u201d Germany already has some 30,000 wind turbines , more than anywhere else in the EU .\nThe gigantic wind turbines have serious problems of noise or infrasound health hazards for residents nearby the huge structures and weather and bird damage .\nBy 2025 an estimated 25 % of existing German windmills will need replacement and waste disposal is a colossal problem .\nThe companies are being sued as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are .\nTo reach targets by 2030 Deutsche Bank recently admitted the state will need to create an \u201c eco dictatorship.\n\u201d At the same time the German push to end gasoline or diesel transport by 2035 in favor of e-vehicles is on course to destroy Germany \u2019 s largest and most profitable industry , the auto sector , and take down millions of jobs .\nThe lithium-ion battery-powered vehicles have a total \u201c carbon footprint \u201d when the effects of mining lithium and producing all parts are included , that is worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of added electricity needed for a zero carbon Germany by 2050 would be far more than today , as millions of battery chargers will need grid electricity with reliable power .\nNow Germany and the EU begin to impose new \u201c carbon taxes , \u201d allegedly to finance the transition to zero carbon .\nThe taxes will only make electric power and energy even more expensive , insuring the faster collapse of German industry .\nAccording to those advancing the Zero Carbon agenda , it is just what they desire : the deindustrialization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculated decades-long strategy as Maurice Strong said , to bring about the collapse of industrialized civilizations .\nTo turn the present world industrial economy backward to a wood-burning , windmill turning dystopia where blackouts become the norm as now in California , is an essential part of a Great Reset transformation under the Agenda 2030 : UN Global Compact for Sustainability .\nMerkel climate adviser , Joachim Schnellnhuber , in 2015 presented the radical green agenda of Pope Francis , the encyclical letter , Laudato Si , as Francis \u2019 appointee to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advised the EU on its green agenda .\nIn a 2015 interview , Schnellnhuber declared that \u201c science \u201d has now determined that the maximum carrying capacity of a \u201c sustainable \u201d human population was some six billion fewer people : To do that the industrialized world must be dismantled .\nChristiana Figueres , a World Economic Forum Agenda Contributor and former executive secretary of the UN \u2019 s Framework Convention on Climate Change , revealed the true aim of the UN climate agenda in a February 2015 Brussels press conference where she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in human history that we are setting ourselves the task of intentionally changing the economic development model that has reigned since the Industrial Revolution.\n\u201d Figueres \u2019 2015 remarks are echoed today by French President Macron at the January 2021 World Economic Forum \u2019 s \u201c Davos Agenda \u201d where he claimed that \u201c

Germany , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sweden .\nIn the five countries with the highest COVID jab uptake , fertility has dropped by an average of 15.2 % , whereas the five countries with the lowest COVID jab uptake have seen an average decline of just 4.66 % The first COVID shots rolled out in December 2020 , and it didn \u2019 t take long before doctors and scientists started warning of possible reproductive effects .\nAmong them were Janci Chunn Lindsay , Ph.D. , director of toxicology and molecular biology for Toxicology Support Services LLC , who in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2019 s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) , highlighting the high potential for adverse effects on fertility .\nI previously interviewed Lindsay in 2021 .\nThat article is not updated with the new information , but the interview ( above ) is a good primer for the information she shares below .\nIn many ways , she predicted what we are now observing .\nShe stressed there \u2019 s credible evidence that the COVID shots may cross-react with syncytin and reproductive genes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways that might impair reproductive outcomes .\n\u201c We could potentially be sterilizing an entire generation , \u201d she warned .\nLindsay also pointed out that reports of significant menstrual irregularities and vaginal hemorrhaging in women who received the injections by then already numbered in the thousands , and that this too was a safety signal that should not be ignored .\nAs it turns out , early reports of menstrual irregularities were not a fluke .\nMore recent investigations have confirmed that , indeed , many women experience menstrual irregularities after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mid-July 2022:2 Other categories of people reporting abnormal breakthrough bleeding included 39 % of those on gender-affirming hormone treatments , 71 % of women on long-acting contraceptives and 66 % of postmenopausal women.4 Older women , those who used hormonal contraception , had been pregnant previously , or had diagnoses of endometriosis , fibroids or polycystic ovarian syndrome were more likely to experience heavier bleeding than normal after their shots .\nIt \u2019 s worth noting that the COVID trials did not ask female participants about their menses , and didn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nYet , despite this clear lack of data collection , the official narrative is that everything is fine \u2014 the shots are safe and won \u2019 t impact fertility .\nJust how do they know ?\nThey don \u2019 t , and that \u2019 s what makes such claims so egregious .\nMaking matters worse , media reporting these findings continue to insist that post-jab menstrual irregularities are \u201c normal \u201d and not a sign that reproductive capacity is being impacted .\nFor example , Science writes:5 Again , no one knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the simple fact that it hasn \u2019 t been studied .\nNo study means no data , which means no knowledge .\nIt \u2019 s that simple .\nAny claims to the contrary are based on pure guesswork , and guessing is not science .\nAnd , while a woman \u2019 s menstrual cycle can fluctuate , abrupt changes have historically not been brushed off as inconsequential .\nOn the contrary , suddenly abnormal menses has been listed as a potential sign of things like:6,7,8 Research9 published April 1 , 2022 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also found an association between the COVID jab and changes in menstrual cycle length .\nThe change was small \u2014 about one day shorter than pre-injection after the second dose \u2014 and was not deemed to be of any great concern .\nStill , in my mind , the change indicates that something is happening .\nThe question is what ?\nSome investigators have suggested the menstrual irregularities seen in female COVID patients and the COVID-jabbed alike may be attributed to an immune response to the spike protein .\nBack in January 2021 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BioMedicine Online found that 28 % of unvaccinated women of reproductive age diagnosed with COVID-19 had a change in the length of their cycle , 19 % had prolonged cycles and 25 % had a change in menstrual blood volume .\nThe researchers hypothesized that \u201c the menstruation changes of these patients might be the consequence of transient sex hormone changes \u201d caused by a temporary suppression of ovarian function during infection .\nDr. Natalie Crawford , a fertility specialist , has suggested that the menstrual irregularities seen in female COVID-19 patients may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and since the COVID shot instructs your body to make the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein , which your immune system then responds to , the effects of the jab may be similar to the natural infection.11 In a 2021 BMJ editorial , Male , quoted by Science above , presented a similar view:12 That doesn \u2019 t mean menstrual irregularities are of no consequence , though .\nAfter all , it appears we \u2019 re dealing with a manmade virus , and the mRNA in the shot that programs for spike protein production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nPerhaps this is why a greater percentage of women report menstrual irregularities following the COVID jab , compared to the percentage of women who experience irregularities following natural infection ?\nIt may also be worth looking into the parallels between the blood clotting disorders reported \u2014 both in some COVID-19 cases and post-COVID-19 jab \u2014 and Von Willebrand disease,13 a chronic condition that prevents normal blood clotting , thus resulting in excessively heavy periods .\nMenstrual irregularities aren \u2019 t the only safety signal .\nMiscarriages , fetal deaths and stillbirths have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID shots .\nIn November 2021 , Lions Gate Hospital in North Vancouver , British Columbia ( BC ) , delivered an astonishing 13 stillborn babies in a 24-hour period , and all of the mothers had received the COVID jab.14 In a typical month , there may be one stillborn baby at the hospital , making 13 stillbirths in 24 hours highly unusual .\nScotland has also experienced an unusual rise in infant death rates .\nDuring September 2021 , at least 21 babies under 4 weeks old died \u2014 a rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the average death rate among newborns in Scotland is about 2 per 1,000 births.15 Yet , despite stillbirths going up after the introduction of the COVID jabs \u2014 as opposed to rising beforehand \u2014 studies linking stillbirths to SARS-CoV-2 infection have been used to encourage pregnant women to get the shot.16 So , basically , it \u2019 s been discovered that the infection itself can cause stillbirth ( and we know the spike protein of the virus is the part that causes most of the problems ) , yet they want you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the shot will somehow have a protective impact on pregnancy .\nThis line of reasoning falls apart even further when you consider that scientists are now saying post-jab menstrual irregularities are likely due to immune responses that arise in response to both the virus and the jab .\nIf that \u2019 s true , then why would the COVID shot not also be able to cause stillbirths to the same or greater degree than the virus ?\nThere Are No Data to Support COVID Jab for Pregnant Women Health officials are adamant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the data don \u2019 t support its safety .\nThe CDC-sponsored study17 published in The New England Journal of Medicine ( NEJM ) that was widely used to support the U.S. recommendation for pregnant women to get injected was corrected in October 2021 , with the correction stating:18 Other recent research19,20 has found the Pfizer COVID jab also \u201c temporarily impairs semen concentration and motile count \u201d in men .\nAs noted by the authors:21 As with women \u2019 s menstrual problems , the authors blame these adverse effects in men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the COVID shot .\nHowever , while they claim men \u2019 s \u2019 reproductive capacity will recover in about three months , this could still be a tremendous problem .\nRemember , the mRNA shots are recommended at three-month intervals for the original series , and boosters are now being recommended at varying intervals thereafter .\nIf you destroy a man \u2019 s sperm for three months every time he gets a COVID shot , you \u2019 re significantly reducing the probability of him fathering a child for a good part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intentional , the fact of the matter is that we \u2019 re now seeing an abrupt drop in live births along with an equally sudden rise in excess deaths among adults .\nThe end result will be a reduction in the global population .\nThat seems inevitable at this point , and the timing of these trends correspond with the release of these experimental COVID gene transfer injections .\nFor example , Germany recently released data showing a 10 % decline in birth rate during the first quarter of 2022.22 The live birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same : 23,24 Other countries are also seeing unexpected birth rate reductions , nine months after the start of the mass vaccination campaign against COVID .\nBetween January and April 2022 , Switzerland \u2019 s birth rate was 15 % lower than expected , the U.K. \u2019 s was down by 10 % and Taiwan \u2019 s was down 23 % .25,26,27 In a July 5 , 2022 , Counter Signal article , Mike Campbell reported concerns expressed by Hungarian MP D\u00far\u00f3 D\u00f3ra during a Parliamentary speech:28 After looking into further , Campbell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest COVID jab uptake , fertility has dropped by an average of 15.2 % , whereas the five countries with the lowest COVID jab uptake have seen an average reduction of just 4.66 % .\nThe U.S. is also showing signs of a drop in live births .\nProvisional data from North Dakota shows a 10 % decline in February 2022 , 13 % reduction in March and an 11 % reduction in April , compared to the corresponding months in 2021.29 Below is a chart from Birth Gauge30 on Twitter comparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a large number of countries .\nTake Responsibility for Your Health At this time , women are not being warned about the risks for miscarriage , menstrual irregularities and the potential for fertility problems and stillbirths , even though all of these safety signals are glaringly obvious .\nAs obstetrician-gynecologist specialist , Dr. James Thorp , told The Epoch Times in April 2022:31 Tragically , doctors are under a worldwide gag order .\nThey steer patients away from the COVID shot at the risk of losing their medical license .\nThis puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as most rely on their doctors to tell them the truth .\nFew expect doctors to lie or hide life-saving information from them simply to protect their own career .\nSo , we \u2019 re in unprecedented times in more ways than

won \u2019 t touch , and if they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t a sign of danger .\nIn such situations , you simply have to put on your thinking cap and think it through for yourself .\nAs of July 15 , 2022 , the U.S .\nVaccine Adverse Event Reporting System ( VAERS ) had logged 1,350,947 adverse event reports following the COVID jab , including 29,635 deaths,32 and there \u2019 s evidence that reports are being deleted from the system by the thousands .\nYou can learn more about that in \u201c Thousands of Deaths and Adverse Reactions Deleted From VAERS.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID jabs exceed anything else in medical history .\nNo drug or vaccine has ever been associated with as many injuries and deaths , including harm to the unborn .\nAt this point , it appears we \u2019 re looking at a certain depopulation event .\nThe question then is , are you willing to accept the risks ?\nAre you willing to risk your fertility , even if only temporarily ?\nAre you willing to risk the life of

Democrat efforts resulted in an unnecessary briefing from the FBI in August 2020 relating to \u201c disinformation \u201d \u2013 which was later leaked to the press to paint the Biden investigation \u201c in a false light.\n\u201d In other words , the FBI was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats less than 3 months before the 2020 election .\nThen there \u2019 s also the issue of FBI Headquarters interfering in the Hunter Biden investigation .\nGrassley states : The FBI Headquarters team \u201c made findings \u201d to whether certain reporting was disinformation \u2013 and then they limited access to those findings .\nThis begs the question : what were those findings , and did they conflict with the popular narrative , falsely peddled by the Democrats and the media and former intelligence officials , that the Hunter Biden materials were disinformation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this information before the election .\nWhen then-Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe stated there was \u201c no intelligence to support \u201d allegations of Russian disinformation efforts tied to the Hunter Biden materials , the FBI responded they had \u201c nothing to add at this time.\n\u201d Of course , this is apparently now disproven .\nThe FBI had something to add .\nThey just didn \u2019 t want to share it with the American people .\nAnd there \u2019 s still more .\nIn

anti-Trump FBI Agent from the Washington Field Office who shared derogatory social media posts about Attorney General Barr and retweeted Lincoln Project posts insulting President Trump .\nThibault has since locked his Twitter account , which is highlighted with a Ukraine flag .\nYou can make your own judgment on that .\nBack to Thibault \u2019 s actions with respect to the Hunter Biden investigation .\nThe whistleblowers further allege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was \u201c at risk of disinformation , \u201d although \u201c all of the reporting was either verified or verifiable via criminal search warrants.\n\u201d Thibault allegedly also violated FBI guidelines by ordering the matter closed without a valid reason .\nThibault and other FBI officials then covered these tracks , attempting \u201c to improperly mark the matter in FBI systems so that it could not be opened in the future.\n\u201d Making matters worse \u2013 if that \u2019 s possible \u2013 we also learned from Grassley

Crypto", "content": "As the Bitcoin revolution reaches the level of the nation state , we look at the current trends in crypto-currency worldwide , with a particular focus on Africa .\nThe Central African Republic ( CAR for short ) has been independent of colonial rule for 62 years .\nIt is one of the richest nations on Earth , replete with abundant natural resources ; oil , coal , uranium for energy , gold , silver and copper for industry , as well as some of the world \u2019 s largest diamond mines and most productive arable lands and lumberyards .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers abundant hydro-electric energy .\nYet , it is still a desperately poor country in human and socioeconomic terms .\nIt has some of the very lowest economic indicators in the world \u2013 high infant mortality , and civil wars which keep CAR in a perpetually dire condition .\nIts people , instead of being able to relish the Edenic land they were born into , have instead been enslaved , having had their lands pillaged .\nIt \u2019 s a nation which has been largely discarded following generations of colonial exploitation over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back as the 1600s , the local currency has been debased by European travellers .\nAkori beads , delicate beads of high quality design and rare metals , were once widespread as a legitimate currency among African traders .\nTheir source was unknown , but thought to be in Ghana , while some speculate that the most valuable beads were from meteoric metals .\nThese fine beads functioned for 2,000 years as a medium of exchange throughout Africa .\nThen , when European travellers arrived with cheaply produced factory beads , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole country .\nTheir exploitation ran so deep that these beads were forever tarnished and are now referred to as \u2018 slave beads \u2019 .\nFor decades , the price of a central African slave was measured in beads .\nAnd after tumultuous road to CAR independence , not much has changed .\nThe government is still today deliberately weakened by outside forces who in a mafia like fashion , continue the resource-plunder unabated .\nThis is the picture of an African country , exploited by Europe , now mired in poverty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too common tale .\nYet , there \u2019 s something new happening in CAR .\nNow the eagle-eyed news scourers may have seen talk of a Bitcoin law being passed in CAR \u2019 s legislature this April .\nThe government had announced deliberations to follow the path of El Salvador in Central America , by adopting Bitcoin crypto currency as legal tender .\nThis means the state would provide infrastructure for the use of Bitcoin in private and public transactions .\nThis radical move would allow the 50 % of the population who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access to goods and services .\nOn another level it could allow the State of CAR to slip out from under the US-dollar dominated economic hegemony \u2013 those vultures at the IMF , World Bank and Bank of International Settlements .\nI will not paint Bitcoin as purely a panacea as it has its own flaws .\nFor example , digital infrastructure will be a major challenge , as many in CAR don \u2019 t have access to computers , phones or internet .\nAlso , the day-today volatility of Bitcoin can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means that holders could experience uncomfortable fluctuations in the price of certain goods and services .\nDespite all of this , it is well worth exploring alternative avenues for a country that has been utterly failed by the dominant system .\nHowever , as with many new bitcoiners , CAR was lured in by an alt-coin promising even bigger benefits than mere Bitcoin .\nCAR \u2019 s president was wooed by a pair of controversial crypto personalities , Brian Armstrong of Coinbase fame , and Sam Bankman Fried .\nThey worked with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coin .\nNamed after one of the nation \u2019 s languages , Sango Coin was to be a national currency .\nNot just a centralised currency controlled by the state , it would be tied to CAR \u2019 s abundant natural resources .\nLike so many other such alt-coin projects in the crypto-currency sphere , Sango Coin appears to have been over-hyped and pumped up as a potential boon for speculators .\nThis week saw the CAR \u2019 s official launch of Sango Coin , but so far , the initial offering was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have hoped , recording only $ 1.09 million in the first 24 hours .\nThe marketing pitch should be familiar by now .\nSango \u2019 s sleek website invites you to join the elite club of coin holders .\nIf you buy in early you enter a draw to win plots of actual land in Africa .\nFurthermore , if you invest $ 60,000 USD equivalent today , you can earn yourself CAR citizenship .\nThey even went as far as promoting a new \u2018 Crypto Island \u2019 on the River Congo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nYet , you have to marvel at the innovation here .\nCertainly , it \u2019 s one of the most bold crypto offering yet .\nYet , the small print was never very clear .\nMany questioned how natural assets would be tied into the blockchain .\nIf it mirrors Wall Street \u2019 s \u2018 Natural Asset Corporations \u2019 , a central pillar of the globalists \u2019 Green New Deal and Great Reset plans , then it does not bode well .\nThis does seem ripe for exploitation by those same colonial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sango project didn \u2019 t open up its books for people to check the distribution methods of the coin and did not readily gain much trust internationally .\nFurthermore , Sango Coin was never a \u2018 proof-of-work \u2019 currency like Bitcoin .\nHere we must take a small diversion into nerd territory , but hold on to your thinking caps , it \u2019 s worth learning .\nIn Bitcoin , new coins are created by miners .\nThey exert an amount of energy to solve a complex sum then enter that into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bitcoin .\nThereby proving who created and owns that coin .\nIt is an expense to buy energy to mine Bitcoin , but the intrinsic value of a Bitcoin as a scarce and provable digital asset , gives it a higher market price .\nYou can therefore think of Bitcoin as an energy currency .\nSimilar to that proposed by Henry Ford 100 years ago : \u201c Under the Energy Currency [ Bitcoin ] system the standard would be a certain amount of energy exerted for one hour that would be equal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a case of thinking and calculating in terms different from those laid down to us by the international banking group to which we have grown so accustomed that we think there is no other desirable standard.\n\u201d \u2013 Ford , NY Times 1921 Ford could see the ills being exerted on the world by a small cadre of financial elites during the Great War .\nHis forward-thinking idea would come to fruition a century later , with batteries \u2018 hash machine \u2019 computers all helping to facilitate an endless stream of blockchain transactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Energy Currency \u2019 would level the global playing field .\nSuddenly CAR , with abundant power generating capacity , could become self-sufficient and take its rightful place high-up in the global economy .\nThose states in Europe would have to provide some useful service in return for their energy currency , rather than simply print pounds , euros or dollars which decline in value year-on-year .\nThe model of an energy currency , where you prove your work and earn a hard currency asset in return , is working for Bitcoin .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Brussels to Burkina Faso .\nProof-of-work is arguably the most important aspect of Bitcoin \u2019 s value .\nIn contrast , Sango Coin was designed to be \u2018 proof-of-stake.\n\u2019 That means that whoever owns the coins has a say over the minting process .\nThere are no miners , no work required \u2013 it is simply a token .\nThus , the state would control the creation of new coins , decide how the coin was regulated , and could change those conditions whenever it wanted to .\nIt was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to refuse .\nHe could build his own currency from scratch .\nHe was , in my opinion , blinkered to the cold realities of such a project .\nThe government never made it clear how the nations resources would be tied into the currency , or how it would fit in with prior statements on Bitcoin , and it would not publish much of the technical information of Sango Coin .\nThis opacity may be its undoing , and I believe could lead to the failure of the project .\nNo wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been frosty .\nOn its opening day , it has only sold 5 % of the first mint .\nUsually , if a crypto product is healthy it will sell-out and begin to appreciate in price as more people demand the limited supply .\nWith just over $ 1million of its $ 21 million available sold , it tappearso have fallen way short of its creators \u2019 expectations .\nIt seems even the irresistible offer of cheap land couldn \u2019 t sway many buyers .\nIt looks like , for now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just a mirage .\nBut these are early days in this novel economic sphere , and I hold out hope that as time progresses , the understanding of these technologies will develop and begin to emancipate people from economic tyranny .\nIt seems that everywhere whether we look in the Bitcoin space , or the stock market , we find the common thread .\nMisunderstanding the technology leads to mistakes and malfeasance .\nThe 2007 Lehman Brothers collapse was brought about by a conglomeration of nested investment products .\nPackages of mortgage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rating agencies , lead to a spiraling bubble in sub-prime debts .\nThis complex lattice of derivative products formed a smokescreen behind which nefarious actors could make a quick buck and leave .\nUltimately , nobody was jailed because the scam was so complicated , nobody could be implicated directly .\nSadly , this occurs just as easily in the crypto-currency sphere .\nIn the last month , the price of Bitcoin has more than halved .\nThe total market capitalisation of all crypto-currencies has also halved .\nNow there are many causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exogenous causes , from outside of the system can certainly be implicated .\nThe general negative economic environment mean there is less easy money around and some people had to pull out their recent investments in crypto-currency .\nAnd some causes of the price fall are endogenous .\nFor one thing , Tesla liquidated 75 % of its Bitcoin holdings to cover its running costs for this year .\nThis created a large sell pressure as supply increased rapidly .\nHowever , more integral to the drop is the de-fi collapse ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ De-fi \u2019 is short for decentralised finance .\nIt refers to any financial activity which takes place using decentralised tokens and networks \u2013 those largely made up of individuals and small companies .\nTo some it offers a great hope for a future of banking free from centralised control and censorship .\nOthers see a Wild West , where under-regulation leads to a plethora of scams and swindles .\nAs the economic outlook worsened , the de-fi space was hit hardest .\nIt relied on lots of fresh investment and saw a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s latest ballooning .\nYet when those lines of liquidity ( money ) dried up , the house of cards stacked atop tumbled down .\nAmongst the many companies who have dissolved or broken down recently , it is Celsius which typifies the problem most clearly .\nAccording to Celsius \u2019 website , the company was dreamed up on the back of a napkin in 2017 .\nBy 2018 they had formed a company and launched a new token , known as CEL .\nThe CEO , Alex Mashinsky , had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and brought a cult-like following to the company .\nWhat Celsius offered was a place to save your money outside of the bank , and a place to invest your money outside of the stock market .\nIt would be the middle man allowing somebody with Bitcoin holdings to offer them up for loans , without having to sell them .\nThis is an attractive prospect for those seeking to avoid the taxable event at the point of sale of the Bitcoin asset .\nThe owner could then claim the interest on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a loan of Bitcoin , use it for investment , and return the original amount plus interest , without having to have a lot of money to start with .\nIt seemed like a win-win , and many regular people began to pile in seeking to garner some easy profit .\nYet it was too good to be true .\nEarlier this year , there began rumblings among some investors that Celsius was not being clear with what they were doing with people \u2019 s investments .\nIt turns out they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invested in high-risk companies , some of which collapsed .\nThey also were gaming their own token : pumping up the price and selling off their own private holdings .\nAll the while they were making spurious claims about how secure their service was , and downplayed the huge risks they took .\nThe company had started with honest intentions but came to embody the worst of legacy finance institutions , corruption , obfuscation and outright crime .\nWhat began as a decentralised lending platform had grown into an unregulated bank and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are highly illegal .\nIt all came to a head when investors tried to pull out their money and withdrawals were stopped .\nCelsius had to declare bankruptcy and is going through the process of administration .\nThey still refuse to declare how big the black hole in the balance sheet is .\nInvestors , who were lured in by the promise of easy profit and the crypto-currency dream of escaping the banksters , were betrayed .\nSome larger investors , even upon doing due diligence , could not see any warning signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex structures involved in these de-fi products make it very unclear where the risk truly lies .\nThere have even been cases of suicide due to retirees having gambled and lost their pensions on this scheme .\nDoubtless Mashinsky will face his day in court , but it is little comfort to those who lost their life savings and won \u2019 t get them back .\nTying these stories together , that of CAR and their initial folly into Sango Coin , and those who lost out when the mirage of Celsius \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows that it is hard for many to gain a clear understanding of how this space actually works .\nThese cases demonstrate that the biggest thing hampering crypto-currency adoption is lack of knowledge .\nAs with all technologies , they start with a few people who understand it , and slowly filter out into the general population .\nWe are still early .\nWe have seen Bitcoin adopted as legal tender in El Salvador , which has shown some strength , and may develop some resilience as time goes on .\nIt has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who remembers well the tyranny of the US dollar .\nWe also see that Russia is prepared to accept Bitcoin in trade for some commodities , including oil and gas , which could expand in utility with its allies China and Turkey .\nInternational financier Christine Lagarde has publicly opined about the use of Bitcoin as an escape valve or loophole for people and nations to escape the yoke economic sanctions and financial tyranny .\nThe Bank of International Settlements , the cadre who pulls the strings at the world \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bitcoin as just another Dutch Tulip : a meaningless asset with no intrinsic value .\nYet , millions of people around the world use Bitcoin to cheaply send money home to their family , millions of businesses around the world accept it for payments and nation states themselves hold it in their reserves alongside other hard assets like gold .\nEven Lagarde \u2019 s own European Central Bank admits it will one day have Bitcoin held in its vaults .\nSo the state of crypto-currency today is\u2026 we \u2019 ll have to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that emancipatory blockchain .\nThere also is fear and uncertainty about its future .\nOne thing is for sure , it \u2019 s not going away , and it gets more interesting by the day .\nIt is my belief that as the level of understanding about this new technology increases , so will its usage and concurrently so will the benefits .\nThe proof-of-work nature of Bitcoin \u2013 an energy currency , is one of the great innovations of the technological era .\nIt offers an alternative to centralised currencies which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlords and which have been used globally as tools of oppression .\nSomehow Bitcoin retains a mystique , despite everybody having heard of it .\nYet , once it breaks out of its cage , there \u2019 s no telling how far the Bitcoin revolution will run .\nA brief history of Akori Beads in Africa [ Afrikapital.org ] : https : //www.afrikapital.org/p/akori-beads-hyper-inflation-and-ancient Russia to

"content": "While Russia continues to pay a heavy military price for its cruel invasion of Ukraine , things look different on the economic front .\nDespite repeated assurances from President Biden and other Western leaders that \u201c the toughest economic sanctions in history \u201d would cripple Russia \u2019 s economy and starve its war machine , that hasn \u2019 t happened .\nRussia \u2019 s current account , which measures global trade in goods and services , was strong in the second quarter of this year when its trade surplus rose to a record $ 70.1 billion .\nThe ruble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranking as the strongest performing currency so far this year , rising to its highest level against the euro since 2015 and making major gains against the dollar .\nWhat accounts for Putin \u2019 s bulging coffers ?\nThe simple answer : high commodity prices and Russia \u2019 s continued ability to export oil , gas , grain , and even gold to non-Western countries .\nThe economic picture isn \u2019 t as rosy for the countries sanctioning Russia .\nEurope is struggling to meet its energy needs , driving up inflation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green movement to backpedal .\nGermany , for example , whose minister of economic affairs and climate action comes from the Green Party , was forced to reactivate seventeen coal-fired power plants it previously had shut down .\nPresident Biden , with inflation sitting at a forty-year high , recently begged Saudi Arabia \u2019 s leaders\u2014a regime it had been shunning\u2014to come to the rescue by pumping more crude to help bring down gas prices and ease the inflationary pressure high fuel prices are placing on other goods .\nIn short , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s unprovoked war seems to be taking a greater toll on the rest of the world than on Russia itself .\nWestern leaders should have learned by now to take two factors into account when placing sanctions on a dictator : the moral case and the likely social and economic consequences .\nThere was clearly tension between the two in this instance .\nThe moral case called for isolating Russia \u2019 s economy as much as possible .\nBut , given the existing supply and demand imbalances that became apparent as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socioeconomic calculator should have pointed to a sanctions regime that would avoid exacerbating the problems ( if that is even possible ) .\nThat \u2019 s not what happened .\nThe combination of sanctions and war disrupted energy and grain supplies , creating an economic opportunity that Russia has exploited .\nIndeed , according to the Helsinki-based Center for Energy and Clean Air , Moscow earned $ 100 billion in revenue from oil , gas , and coal sales in the first three months of the war alone .\nWhile the Biden administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to increase available supplies and lower gasoline prices\u2014plunging America \u2019 s emergency reserve to its lowest level since the mid-1980s\u2014Russia \u2019 s oil exports had bounced back to pre-war levels by May .\nEurope , meanwhile , which imported 40 percent of its natural gas from Russia last year , is now facing the double-whammy of severe shortages due to dwindling Russian imports and higher inflation fueled in part by energy prices .\nThis could lead to a long , cold winter when the demand for energy explodes at the same time Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Russia , as a European Union ( EU ) regulation introduced in June requires .\nThings could get even worse if Russia decides to cut off natural gas exports to Europe through pipelines , which is temporarily allowed under the EU edict .\nThe big picture can be seen in the numbers .\nIn February , when Russia invaded Ukraine , the Federal Reserve \u2019 s global commodity price index stood at 203 ; by the end of June , it was 227 , a 12 percent increase .\nInstead of starving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price increases have strengthened Russia \u2019 s finances .\nThe idea was for the West to help Ukraine win the war or at

around for a long time .\nIn 1817 , the President of the Royal Society in London warned that there had been \u2018 a considerable change of climate , inexplicable at present to us \u2019 and said that this would lead to changes in the accessibility of the Arctic Seas .\nIt was nonsense , of course .\nA century later , in 1922 , the Washington Post warned that the Arctic was warming up , that icebergs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seals were finding the water too hot .\nIn 1947 , The West Australian , quoted a Dr Ahlmann , a Swedish geophysicist who was warning about a mysterious warming of the climate .\nAnd in 1958 , the Sunday Telegraph in London warned that the climate is getting warmer .\nThen the scaremongers suddenly went into reverse , and in the 1970s the experts warned that a new ice age could grip the world within the lifetime of present generations .\nNigel Calder , a science writer , warned in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the threat of a new ice age must stand alongside nuclear war as a source of wholesale death and misery .\nCalder claimed that the northern hemisphere had been cooling since 1950s and that the droughts in Africa and India were due to the \u2018 little ice age \u2019 .\nIn 1975 , Newsweek magazine ran a story called , \u2018 The Cooling World \u2019 and predicted the beginning of dramatic global cooling which might well lead to a drastic decline in food production .\nThey talked about economic and social adjustments on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , over 30 years later , Newsweek published a correction . )\nThe bottom line is that politicians , journalists and experts are forever warning us of terrible things that are about to happen .\nThe invariable rider is that they might well be able to save us from the terrible future which they predict , if we give them vast amounts of money , enormous prestige and a full page profile in the Guardian newspaper .\nThe BBC and other corrupt and blatantly dishonest news organisations now claim that global warming is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussed .\nThis is a lie of course .\n( The BBC makes the same bizarre claim about almost all contentious scientific issues . )\nGlobal warming is simply a pseudoscientific cult for self-important hypocrites and the people who promote the global warming myth are richly rewarded for their obedience while those who dare to question it are severely punished .\nGovernments , big industries ( with a vested interest in the changes being forced upon us ) , ruthless lobbyists and , of course , the United Nations keep up the daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , deceits and pseudoscience .\nIt is , to use a felicitous phrase devised by my friend Dr Colin Barron , a seemingly unending example of \u2018 death porn fear \u2019 .\nThe UK Government says that tackling global warming will require a host of new incentives , laws , rules , bans , taxes , appliance standards and institutional innovations .\nIn November 2020 , as the UK \u2019 s economy fell apart , the Government announced another package of \u00a312 billion worth of investment in green infrastructure such as cycle lanes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge pressure for \u2018 climate denial \u2019 to be criminalised and for those questioning

\u2019 .\nGore was , of course , the presenter of an infamous video which has been proven to contain misleading pseudoscience .\nMuch the same is happening everywhere .\nIn the US , President Joe Biden wants to spend $ 2 trillion \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European Union has earmarked 30 % of its $ 880 billion recovery fund for climate measures .\nToday , it is estimated that 85 % of all our energy comes from fossil fuels and the plan is to replace all this with solar and wind power .\nBoth the EU and China have committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions though this will , inevitably ,

, made headlines in 2019 by suggesting \u201c humans should become cannibals to fight climate change , because eating human flesh is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry.\n\u201d 24 He even insisted cannibalism was a more sustainable option than a diet of insects .\nWhile his concept didn \u2019 t grow legs right then and there , it seems someone , somewhere , took note of his insane ideas .\nWhile cannibalism has indeed featured on and off throughout human history , it was typically \u2014 although with some notable exceptions \u2014 a measure of last resort .\nPeople ate family members and neighbors to survive famine.25 To suggest that the most advanced human civilization in known memory start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment \u201d is unreasonable in the extreme .\nWe have regenerative farming methods that would ease most of our environmental concerns .\nThere \u2019 s absolutely no reason to jump from industrial farming all the way to cannibalism .\nMuch of the supposed \u201c inspiration \u201d behind the promotion of unnatural diets is said to come from a desire to save the planet .\nWhile that \u2019 s admirable , it \u2019 s important to realize that the entire \u201c green \u201d agenda \u2014 as it is currently promoted \u2014 is nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring people to the point of accepting living conditions that would otherwise be unacceptable , such as eating a diet of bugs , drinking reclaimed sewage water and even , apparently , cannibalism .\nThe green agenda is based on cherry-picked flawed ideas , such as the idea that nitrogen fertilizer is a pollutant that must be reined in by eliminating farming .\nWithout farmers , what will we eat ?\nThe technocratic , transhumanist-loving cabal \u2019 s answer : Weeds , bugs and , possibly , each other .\nIt sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do want to get rid of as many people as possible , and no strategy is ethically off-limits , be it the promotion of abortion , the elimination of fossil fuels without having a workable replacement , the mandating of experimental gene transfer injections , insect diets , reclaimed sewage water or cannibalism .\nBy the way , a number of U.S. states have also adopted alkaline hydrolysis26 as an alternative to cremation , where dead bodies are dissolved and the water from the process is flushed down the sewer .\nWhat could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water used to dissolve human remains into the sewer and then repurposing that same water into drinking water ?\nEven if mostly symbolic , this too is a form of cannibalism .\nWhy Are the Elitists \u2019 \u2018 Answers \u2019 so Gross ?\nIf you \u2019 re like most , you \u2019 re probably wondering why everything the technocratic cabal presents as \u201c the answer \u201d to our global woes is so darn gross and dehumanizing .\nThe simple answer is that we \u2019 re not human to them .\nWe \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that exist for their benefit and exploitation .\nThey \u2019 re \u201c above \u201d the rest of us .\nWe may not have a caste system , officially , but there are two classes in this world .\nBefore farmers realized that mad cow was created by the feeding of bovine parts back to cattle , this practice was commonplace .\nAnd , frankly speaking , the technocratic elitists see us the same way .\nWhy not feed useless eaters back to the ones that still have some worker-bee value ?\nTo them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt \u2019 s efficient , and technocracy is based in large part on the efficiency of any given system .\nRobots are more efficient than humans , hence robots are the better choice .\nArtificial intelligence is more efficient than the human intellect , and hence they want to merge with it .\nWhat to do with useless humans , is the question .\nAnd the answer is to get rid of them , in whatever way works , without raising the ire of too many peasants .\nFor now , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infancy .\nBut the fact that bugs are on the menu \u2014 now , today \u2014 is undeniable .\nCelebrities , of course , have a role to play in any successful social engineering project , and in the video above , the actress Nicole Kidman takes one for the team .\n\u201c Three million people in the world eat bugs , and I \u2019 m one of them , \u201d she says , wolfing down a number of different insects , some live and others fried for a crispy crunch .\nYou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fried ones were fried in seed oils .\nMy skepticism of her genuineness aside , research has concluded that celebrities can indeed \u201c persuade people to eat insects.\n\u201d As reported by PsychReg.org:27 Obviously , this research is not languishing in a hidden drawer .\nThe technocratic Great Reset adherents are putting the findings to work .\nExamples of celebrities espousing the deliciousness and healthiness of bugs include Drew Barrymore , Robert Downey Jr. , celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay , Salma Hayek and Angelina Jolie , just to name a few.28 While cannibalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head-on manner , humans have been ingesting and taking in other humans in other ways for many years .\nFor example , human aborted fetal cells are frequently used in the development of vaccines .\nAnd , while human cells are not present in the final product , DNA fragments and cell proteins can still be present .\nTo learn more about this process , see this article .\nA short excerpt reads as follows:29 Other products that use aborted fetus parts in their development include cosmetics , pharmaceutical drugs and flavor enhancers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of aborted fetal cells in these kinds of products justifiable ?\nSurprisingly , according to Human Life International ( HLI ) ,32 a supposedly pro-life , Catholic organization , it is justifiable if it \u2019 s \u201c in the service of humanity.\n\u201d HLI believes vaccines are in the service of humanity , so therefore the use of aborted fetal cells in the development of vaccines is acceptable .\nCosmetics , however , can not save lives , so therefore , the \u201c disgusting practice \u201d of using fetuses in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seems to me that this is really splitting hairs .\nHLI is basically saying that the ends justify the means , even if otherwise deemed abhorrent and potentially unhealthy ( as injecting another person \u2019 s DNA fragments can be ) .\nBy that rationale , cannibalism could be justified in the name of environmental protection ( as some people insist ) , and I really don \u2019 t think we ought to go there .\nAs mentioned earlier , we have good , solid solutions for our environmental concerns .\nRegenerative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ livestock \u2014 is the way to go if we really want to clean up the globe , reduce water consumption and normalize weather .\nThe notion that our only way out is a diet of insects and cannibalism is foolishly ignorant in the extreme , and needs to be opposed at every turn .\nThose are not foundational solutions in the least .\nThey are tools to enslave , denigrate and dehumanize humanity , invented by people who see every steak on your plate as something that has been stolen from theirs .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAuthor Dr. Joseph Mercola is the founder of Mercola.com .\nAn

\u2019 re going to Starve Us and Freeze Us to Death.\n\u2019 The video was , of course , taken down within hours and was permanently banned .\nI thought you might like to read the script .\nIt explains what I was thinking over two years ago\u2026 Have you noticed how the unelected intellectual terrorists leading the way in the coronavirus hoax are keen on phrases to describe what they \u2019 re doing to us , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they \u2019 ve got us all neatly tied up and terrified ?\nI should explain , by the way , that I am perfectly serious in describing the proponents of the coronavirus hoax as terrorists .\nTerrorism can be defined as using intimidation and violence in the pursuit of political aims .\nWell , governments everywhere have been certainly using intimidation to pressurise us into being scared of their fashionable version of the flu bug .\nAnd if someone threatens to send uniformed men round to arrest me if I don \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as I am concerned that is violence .\nTo get back to the phrases they have adopted to describe the world they want us to live in .\nFirst , there \u2019 s the new normal , of course , which should be the new abnormal because it bears absolutely no resemblance to anything I am inclined to accept as normal .\nI have nothing but contempt for people who are so supine that they willingly wear masks when popping to the shops or who would rather step off the pavement and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus than risk sharing space with another citizen .\nI \u2019 ve been retired from medical practice for years and I took my name off the medical register a long time ago but I am thinking of putting it back on so that I can certify as insane anyone who wears a mask or does the social distancing dance on the pavement or in a shop .\nMasks dehumanise us and take away our human qualities .\nOne of the saddest sights I \u2019 ve seen recently was that of two Ferrari racing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing their masks .\nOh , please .\nI can \u2019 t see Fangio , Stirling Moss , Mike Hawthorn or Gilles Villeneuve wearing silly masks .\n\u2018 Excuse me , \u2019 I will say , standing outside one of the new vaccination centres that they will soon be building on every street corner , \u2018 why are you wearing a mask ?\n\u2019 \u2018 Gtrjsghe kehek mumble mumble , \u2019 they will reply through the requisite number of layers of material , too stupid to know that all masks have pores big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd then I \u2019 ll pull out a mental health act form and sign them up for a long , paid holiday in the loony bin .\nAnother one bites the dust .\nThen there is the green recovery which sounds far less fun than the pink recovery which I intend to promote when I have a spare minute or two , and no more meaningful than the purple with yellow spots recovery .\nI have never had much faith in green recoveries since a racing car team painted its car green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to make clear its green credentials .\nHow a car driven round and round in circles and using up a gallon every three miles can ever be green is beyond me .\nStill , racing car people live in a world of their own .\nI see that the Mercedes formula one team is painting its cars black this year in some sort of show of solidarity with black people though it seems to me to be more akin to virtue signalling via a paint job guaranteed to gain some publicity .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new paint job will do to improve people \u2019 s lives in Africa though I suspect it may all be something to do with the fact a young fellow called Lewis Hamilton who drives one of these things is very outspoken about black issues and what needs to be done .\nI \u2019 d have more respect for Hamilton \u2019 s views if he hadn \u2019 t buggered off to Monaco or Switzerland as soon as he started earning enough money to pay decent amounts of income tax and make a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t expect to have a voice in social affairs if you don \u2019 t contribute meaningful amounts of tax .\nMind you , Hamilton also claims to be keen on environmental issues and yet spends his life flying around the planet in order to drive cars round and round in circles .\nBut then all celebrities live on a different planet to the rest of us .\nHamilton would gain a little admiration and respect if he gave half his annual salary to poor people in Africa \u2013 in lieu of paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , there is the global reset which basically means allowing a bunch of bossy fascists to decide what is good for us , what we should eat , what we should do with our lives and , in due course , what we should think and what we should believe in .\nThere is a war going on for control of the world , our lives , our minds , our souls and our destiny .\nTalking of souls , I am very suspicious , by the way , of the various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut down their churches , cathedrals , mosques and synagogues when the flu first arrived a few months ago .\nWhy did they not feel that their congregations might need a little solace at a time like this ?\nMost congregations have been happily practising social distancing for years so even if there had ever been any theoretical risk , there had never been any practical risk .\nWas it just simple cowardice and irreligious self-preservation which led to the betrayal of millions in their time of need , or were they helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world in which traditional religion is considered inappropriate and possibly even illegal .\nWe aren \u2019 t going to be allowed to have any choice in these matters because these unelected folk ( most of whom none of us has ever heard of ) know better than we do what we want .\nThere was a time when the people used to vote and choose politicians according to their promised policies .\nOf course , it was understood that the politicians would lie and that very few of their promises would be kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy in the whole business , and politicians knew that if they lied too much they would not be given power at the next elections .\nBut the unelected ones who seem to have given themselves the power to decide our future for us seem to want to take control with no mandate from the people .\nPrince Charles , Bill Gates , George Soros and a variety of characters at something called the World Economic Forum have taken upon themselves the authority to decide what is good for us .\nIn my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; corruption is burnt into their empty souls .\nA bunch of people who probably think they are all doing the right thing for the right reasons but who are all doing the wrong thing for the wrong reasons .\nThe World Economic Forum used to be famous only for its daft Davos conferences at which we all smiled indulgently .\nBut now this and other organisations have shown us their true colours and we are clearly in a fight to the death .\nIt \u2019 s them or us .\nThe truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it is and what they want it to be .\nHow many are using Covid-19 to promote their own financial interests at our expense ?\nWe are living in Lewis Carroll \u2019 s worst nightmare .\nIt is difficult not to feel impressed at the way they are managing to keep us oppressed through the constant application of fear .\nIt \u2019 s a simple recipe and it works well with the simple minded .\nAnd then there is the oil .\nThis , like the deliberately engineered coming food shortage is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we face .\nThe coronavirus crime has now turned into a global warming crime .\nThe two have become inextricably linked .\nWe are told that the coronavirus appeared because of climate change and that we must therefore put all our effort into tackling climate change \u2013 although , as I explained in my video entitled ` Climate Change is a Lot of Hot Air \u2019 this whole argument is childish gibberish unsupported by science and largely promoted by publicity seeking celebrities , the ill-informed and the uneducated .\nPoliticians , business leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the high moral ground as they demand that as the economy is reset it puts climate change top of the list of requirements .\nThe vast majority of the people around the world realise that the climate change nonsense is just that \u2013 nonsense .\nIt \u2019 s propaganda with a sinister purpose .\nThe manipulators who are trying to take over the world ( and doing very well so far it has to be admitted ) are using people like Prince Charles , that Swedish kid and untold ignorant celebrities to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd so we are constantly being told that we must stop using oil and other fossil fuels and rely on alternative sources of energy .\nAs I pointed out in my video entitled ` Climate Change is a Lot of Hot Air \u2019 this means relying on biomass \u2013 which is wood \u2013 because wind and solar don \u2019 t provide enough energy to power the laptops and mobile phones so beloved by the climate change nutters .\nAnd in the UK the wood we burn comes from trees chopped down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then brought across the Atlantic in diesel powered ships .\nWhat the nutters don \u2019 t seem to realise is that the oil really is running out .\nRussia and former USSR countries provide 40 % of the EU \u2019 s supplies \u2013 and they are running out .\nAfrican supplies are also falling .\nThe oil currently being formed deep down in the earth will be ready in 50 million years but I \u2019 m not sure I can wait that long .\nThe shortages are exacerbated by the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into cutting exploration by 25 % \u2013 so they obviously aren \u2019 t finding much new oil .\nOne of two things is going to happen .\nEither the price of oil will soar again over the next few years .\nOr millions of people are going to starve or freeze to death as energy systems collapse .\nWell , maybe that is what they want .\nCertainly , a lot of the unelected people who have started talking about overpopulation and the need for a global depopulation programme , would presumably welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been pretty well destroyed by a bug which causes a small part of the real health problems caused by flu .\nI know that we are being lied to constantly .\nI know that our food supplies are being deliberately damaged \u2013 and if you want to know more about what is happening to our food supplies just read the transcript of my video on food which YouTube banned because it was full of truths .\nThe video is entitled \u2018 Why You Should Stockpile Food \u2013 Now !\n\u2019 .\nThey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe video is , I think , still around on places like Bitchute .\nBut the transcript is on this website .\nAs I have already said , our energy supplies are desperately under threat too and that without oil there will be hundreds of millions of deaths around the world .\nThat \u2019 s no exaggeration .\nWithout oil , and other fossil fuels , there will be virtually no electricity for farming or cooking .\nAnd transport will grind to a halt .\nThat may sound all very nice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tents in idyllic rural parts , relying on government hand-outs and stealing turnips , but it \u2019 s a fact of life that they and the frail , the elderly , the very young and most of the rest of us will freeze to death or starve without oil .\nOh , and those who are selfish and greedy enough to be still in love with their electric cars \u2013 quite rightly claiming that subsidies mean they are cheap to run \u2013 might like to think a little more about how electric cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been shown to make global warming worse .\nFans of electric cars tend to forget that the huge quantities of rare earth metals such as lithium , rhodium and cobalt required for the batteries have to be dug out of the ground \u2013 using machinery which is powered with diesel or petrol .\nAn electric car can require 10 kg of cobalt and 60 kg of lithium .\nAnd huge amounts of copper are needed too .\nThe car industry is already struggling to find enough cobalt , lithium to make batteries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s supply of these goodies is very limited .\nOh , and there is , of course , a massive demand for copper for all the wiring .\nThe mining required to dig up these elements requires lots of huge fuel guzzling equipment .\nAs an aside , half of all the cobalt needed is mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo .\nI suggest that electric car fans do a little research into the Democratic Republic of Congo .\nMany of the rare earths used in the manufacture of electric car batteries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children as young as seven .\nSanctimonious green electric car buyers will doubtless be delighted to know that they are providing work for so many under 12s .\nThe price of the materials required for electric car batteries is going to soar and the mines mean much despoliation .\nThe fans of electric cars never seem worried about this .\nNor do they campaign to leave the cobalt and the lithium in the ground as they do with oil .\nTo get back to the electricity supplies : whatever happens I believe there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the next year or two .\nMake plans if you can .\nThere are generators and long-term storage batteries available .\nAnd at the very least get a kettle that will run off the cigar lighter in a car \u2013 then you can at least make a cup of tea or hot soup .\nOr have a hot toddy when the weather gets chilly .", "author": "NEWS WIRE", "url": "https://21stcenturywire.com/2022/08/04/theyre-going-to-starve-us-and-freeze-us-to-death/", "published": "Thu, 04 Aug 2022 10:52:15 +0000",

conflict .\nMr Corbyn said it was \u201c disappointing \u201d that \u201c hardly any of the world \u2019 s leaders use the word peace \u201d when discussing the conflict , claiming too many \u201c use the language of more war and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Islington North also said \u201c much more effort \u201d must be put into securing a peace deal and that if the UN can not negotiate a ceasefire it should make way for an organisation that can .\nThe comments , made in an interview with Al Mayadeen , an independent Arab satellite news channel , are likely to prompt a ferocious backlash from both Tory and Labour MPs .\nTobias Ellwood , the chairman of the defence select committee and a former defence minister , told The Telegraph : \u201c He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been such an inappropriate prime minister for the nation because he doesn \u2019 t understand that the geopolitical consequences of supporting democracy occasionally means using hard power .\n\u201c This is deeply irresponsible for a senior politician .\nI hope his comments are not seen to undermine the wider support for , and the commitment to , supporting Ukraine following this unprovoked invasion by Putin.\n\u201d The UK has been one of the leading backers of Volodymyr Zelensky , the Ukrainian president , as his forces try to repel the invasion .\nBritain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth of military aid to Ukraine in recent months , and Mr Zelensky has praised Boris Johnson for standing by his country .\nBut Mr Corbyn criticised the decision to send weapons , saying : \u201c Pouring arms in isn \u2019 t going to bring about a solution .\nIt is only going to prolong and exaggerate this war .\n\u201c We might be in for years and years of war in Ukraine .\nBut then the world woke up and suddenly realised that Russia and Ukraine are the world \u2019 s biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , so they came to an agreement \u2013 and I hope it holds \u2013 to export grain through Odesa and through the Bosphorus to the rest of the world .\nThat is a good move .\n\u201c But at the same time putting more and more arms into Ukraine isn \u2019 t going to bring about a solution.\n\u201d Mr Zelenksy has made it clear that he will not agree to cede any land to Russia to secure a peace deal .\nMr Corbyn said there must be \u201c more , much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , adding : \u201c What I find disappointing is that hardly any of the world \u2019 s leaders use the word peace .\nThey always use the language of more war and more bellicose war .\n\u201c Ukrainians are dying , Ukrainians have gone into exile , thousands and thousands , and Russian soldiers are dying , conscripted young Russian soldiers are dying .\nThis war is disastrous for the people of Ukraine , for the people of Russia and for the safety and security of the whole

@ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales of pharmaceutical goods , medicines , diagnostics and blood .\nSwitzerland \u2019 s latest trade readings show how the war combined with sanctions on key Russian supplies are distorting global trade \u2014 by rerouting the flow of many key goods , altering demand patterns and causing cargo pileups at European ports .\nAt the same time , authorities are stepping up efforts to monitor compliance with a complex maze of new rules .\nOverall , Russian imports have plunged since the US and its allies imposed sweeping sanctions over Ukraine , dropping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 72.3 billion , according to the Bank of Russia .\nThe authorities have stopped publishing detailed data amid the sanctions , but officials say shipments of investment and intermediate goods have been particularly hard hit .\nComplex machinery like the jet engines and other products coming from Switzerland are items Russia can \u2019 t easily replace from domestic sources .\nBy comparison , the European Union exported 110 million euros ( $ 112 million ) worth of turbojets and 194 million euros of air pumps to Russia from January through May of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nExports of the goods from the bloc of 27 nations to Russia also ticked up in April and May after collapsing in March , though they \u2019 re in line with year-earlier levels , Eurostat data shows .\nTotal EU exports to Russia , however , have fallen since trade restrictions were introduced .\nThe restrictions on several \u2014 but not all \u2014 types of those goods are covered in different sanctions packages introduced in the EU , Switzerland and the UK .\nThe exports have been banned as part of actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others are prohibited for their potential military use and some are considered luxury items sanctioned earlier this year .\nSome of the measures include wind-down periods before the prohibitions come into force , as well as a number of exemptions .\nIn Switzerland \u2019 s case , most of these periods expire between mid-June and the end of July .\nSECO , the Swiss agency which enforces Switzerland \u2019 s sanctions , says not all machinery that falls into these categories are sanctioned and the

Beach , Florida .\nLevin says the operation was \u201c outrageous \u201d and the \u201c worst attack on this republic in modern history.\n\u201d Levin , a former chief of staff to U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese , called in to \u201c Hannity \u201d on Fox News Monday to give his reaction to the then-breaking news that FBI agents executed a search warrant at Trump \u2019 s Mar-a-Lago

@ @ @ @ @ so you have a sitting president who wants to run against him and his attorney general acting like this.\n\u201d Drawing on his experience with the Department of Justice , Levin said that the U.S. attorney in the District of Columbia , Matthew Graves , had jurisdiction over the Trump presidential records case because the National Archives is located in D.C. Graves is also the U.S. attorney overseeing the Jan. 6 investigations .\nLevin said Graves \u2019 office likely coordinated with the U.S. attorney \u2019 s office in Florida and that FBI agents @ @ @

the United States .\nPeriod , \u201d Levin emphasized .\nHe also explained that the precision of the FBI raid suggests it had been planned for some period of time , possibly weeks .\nFor months , watchdog groups have accused former President Trump of violating the Presidential Records Act by improperly handling classified documents .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some documents he was supposed to preserve while in office and took other materials with him to Mar-a-Lago after leaving office .\nEarlier this year , the National Archives and Records Administration recovered 15 boxes of presidential

accordance with federal law .\nBut the agency referred the matter to the Justice Department .\nNew York Times reporter Maggie Haberman has written a forthcoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flush some records down the toilet , an act that would potentially be illegal .\nLevin said the accusations in Haberman \u2019 s book and other reports of Trump \u2019 s alleged misconduct served as a \u201c pretext \u201d for the raid on Mar-a-Lago .\n\u201c There is no justification for sending 30 freaking FBI agents to the former president \u2019 s compound in Mar-a-Lago in early morning and conducting themselves this way or in any other cases in which they \u2019 ve done exactly the same thing , \u201d Levin said .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy [ Attorney General Merrick Garland ] goes after parents .\nHe goes after

became but an empire under Tsar Peter the Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he proclaimed his Muscovite Tsardom the Rossiiskaia Imperiia ( or Russian Empire ) .\nInside the Russian Empire , Ukrainians were commonly seen and referred to as \u2018 Little Russians , \u2019 and only by the middle of the 19th century , a small group of the Ukrainian intelligentsia started developing a \u2018 Ukrainian national ideology , \u2019 as pointed out by the Swiss historian Andreas Kappeler .\nAccording to the Russian Professor Alexei I. Miller , so-called \u2018 Little Russians \u2019 were seen as integral parts of the Russian or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miller explains that some time later , [ a ] fter 1907 , \u201d to be precise , \u201c Russian nationalism developed most actively in the southwestern territories [ of the Russian Empire ] , in the area of present-day Ukraine.\n\u201d In 1910 , for instance , a certain Grigorii A. Andriichuk , representing the area of Podolia in the Imperial Duma ( or the Lower House , a part of the legislative assembly in the late Russian Empire , which held its meetings in the Taurida Palace in St. Petersburg ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukrainian population seems to have stayed a mixture of \u2018 Ukrainophiles \u2019 and \u2018 Little Russians \u2019 right through the 20th and into the 21st .\ncenturies \u2013 the people living in the large land at Europe \u2019 s eastern edge were either West-leaning or \u2018 Ukrainophiles \u2019 or East-leaning or \u2018 Little Russians.\n\u2019 Following the Soviet demise ( 25 December 1991 ) , the Ukraine became an independent nation with a mixed population , neatly spread out according to an east-west axis .\nAnd this country neighbouring Russia , with part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Russia and any kind of Russian influence on Ukraine , was just an opportunity the U.S. could not help by exploit .\nAnd in this context , the name Victoria Nuland invariably pops up .\nAt present , she serves as Under Secretary for Political Affairs since April last year .\nPrior to that , Nuland served as Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs from September 2013 until January 2017 under President Obama and Secretary Kerry .\nIn the latter capacity she was all over the Ukraine , achieving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning U.S. designs on the Ukraine ( designs aimed at replacing Ukrainian President Victor Yanukovych ) was leaked on YouTube \u2013 Nuland can be heard saying the now-infamous phrase \u201c and , you know , Fuck the EU , \u201d as transcribed by none other than the BBC .\nUnder Obama \u2019 s indirect successor , President Biden , she is once again dealing with all things Ukrainian .\nLast year , when Nuland was in the process of becoming a Biden appointee , the American politically progressive/liberal news and opinion website Salon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ominous headline \u201c Who is Victoria Nuland ?\nA really bad idea as a key player in Biden \u2019 s foreign policy team.\n\u201d Arguably , her reasons for being overly concerned with what happens in the Ukraine are somewhat personal .\nVictoria Nuland \u2019 s father , the surgeon Sherwin B. Nuland , was himself namely born to Ukrainian Jewish immigrants \u2013 in fact , originally he carried the surname Nudelman , but as he was planning to enter medical school in 1947 , Sherwin changed his surname to Nuland with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with enthusiasm upon getting the job in September 2013 , in early December , Victoria Nuland proceeded to spill the beans in public : Let me repeat the salient words again , on time slow : the U.S. has spent \u201c over $ 5 billion [ s ] ince Ukraine \u2019 s independence in 1991\u2033 on Russia \u2019 s next-door neighbour to the west .\nThe Obama administration ( 2008-16 ) \u201c redoubled earlier American efforts to detach former Soviet republics from Russian influence and , indeed , to encourage \u2018 regime change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former U.S .\nAmbassador Jack F. Matlock recently .\nIn 2011 , the political scientist Dr Mark R. Beissinger called Ukraine \u2019 s so-called \u201c Orange Revolution [ late November 2004 to January 2005 ] .\n.\n.\none of the most spectacular displays of protest seen on the European continent since the end of the Cold War , \u201d an event that mobilized up 9 million people on the streets of Kiev ( or Kyiv ) and elsewhere in the Ukraine in temperatures as cold as minus 12 degrees centigrade .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and commentators to speak of an actual \u201c Miracle on the Maidan.\n\u201d From the point of the U.S. State Department realizing a miracle is clearly money well-spent .\nA fact that is arguably underlined by the Atlantic Council \u2018 s Peter Dickinson pointing out that this Orange Revolution \u201c succeeded in preventing Kremlin-backed candidate Viktor Yanukovych from stealing the Ukrainian presidency.\n\u201d Instead , a man clearly favoured by the State Department was given the opportunity to lead the Ukraine on a westward path \u2013 Viktor Yushchenko .\nAlas , as explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reasons , in his five-year term at the helm , Yushchenko proved \u201c unable to lead Ukraine decisively towards Euro-Atlantic integration.\n\u201d And as a result , Yanukovych was able to make an unlikely yet effective comeback and won the 2010 presidential election race .\nDickinson argues that the Orange Revolution led many Ukrainians to become \u2018 Ukrainophiles \u2019 and turn against Moscow by claiming their \u201c national identity , \u201d unburdened by the past and boldly stepping into the future .\nAlas , the reality on the ground proved somewhat different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw pro-Russia candidate and former Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych win with narrow margins over Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko .\nYanukovych won with strong support in the Eastern regions , with most regions in the West favoring Tymoshenko , \u201d as reported by CNN .\nThis means that six years after the \u201c Miracle on the Maidan , \u201d the nation was still pretty much divided between \u2018 Little Russians \u2019 in the east and \u2018 Ukrainophiles \u2019 in the west .\nThe present Russian \u201c special military operation \u201d in the Ukraine is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place less than ten years ago \u2013 the so-called \u2018 Maidan Revolution.\n\u2019 This revolution-to-revive-the-so-called \u201c Miracle on the Maidan \u201d started on 21 November 2013 as a \u2018 popular \u2019 movement advocating a pro-European course away from Russia .\nThis \u2018 popular \u2019 movement was thus primarily the \u2018 work \u2019 of \u2018 Ukrainophiles \u2019 inhabiting the western part of the huge country .\nThe population of the Donbas region in the east reacted quite differently .\nDr Andrew Wilson argues in 1995 that the Donbas has been \u201c historically poised between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newly independent Ukraine since 1991 but still the subject of bitter argument between the two states.\n\u201d Wilson explains why what happens in the Donbas counts as follows : Speaking to journalists in March 2014 , Russia \u2019 s President Putin stated that \u201c over all the years of its independence Ukraine has never been able to really overcome its ongoing political and governmental crisis .\nIts most recent exacerbation has led to an armed takeover in Kiev.\n\u201d What Putin here calls an \u201c armed takeover \u201d could be interpreted as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call \u2018 regime change operations , \u2019 as had been witnessed some years previously in the Arab Spring .\nThe BBC reported about the so-called \u201c Maidan Revolution \u201d as follows : \u201c Security forces kill at least 77 protesters in Kyiv .\nPresident Yanukovych flees to Russia , opposition takes over [ in February 2014 .\n.\nwhich led ] Russian forces [ to ] annex Crimea , prompting biggest East-West showdown since [ the ] Cold War .\nUS and European Union impose ever-harsher sanctions on Russia.\n\u201d The events that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war in

their actions as spontaneous and self [ - ] initiated , driven by public anxiety about the future after the victory of the Maidan movement in the capital .\nThe Ukrainian government dismissed the outbreak of protests as provocations organized by pro-Russian agitators and intelligence operators .\nThe above summary of events was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American nonprofit global policy think tank created in 1948 by Douglas Aircraft Company to offer research and analysis to the United States Armed Forces .\nThe Kiev government wasted no time and started shelling the east of the country .\nWhen Ukraine \u2019 s PM Arseniy Yatsenyuk ( 2014-5 ) visited Germany in January 2015 , he was questioned by a Frankfurter Allgemeine reporter about the allegations made by Hurman Rights Watch ( HRW ) regarding the use of cluster bombs and Grad multiple rocket launchers against towns and villages in southeast Ukraine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allegation , adding that \u201c there is no evidence to that .\nNo evidence.\n\u201d At the time , on the other hand , HRW \u2019 s Executive Director Kenneth Roth wrote that \u201c Human Rights Watch has produced considerable evidence of Ukraine \u2019 s failure to always distinguish between military targets and civilians , as the laws of war require.\n\u201d Though his language apears rather equivoval , Roth continues by saying that \u201c [ o ] ur researchers determined the party responsible for the attacks by establishing their incoming direction and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction within the range of the weapon.\n\u201d In other words , Roth was clearly accusing Yatsenyuk of being rather untruthful , which is but a roundabout way of saying that the Ukrainian PM was lying to the German paper .\nFor the past eight years , the Kiev government has persisted in indiscriminatly attacking the population the self-proclaimed Donetsk People \u2019 s Republic ( DPR ) and the Luhansk People \u2019 s Republic ( LPR ) .\nRussian media have over the past years scrupulously kept track of these ostensible war crimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained all but silent on the topic .\nBut now , now the situation has completely changed .\nNow , Russia is cast as the aggressor and President Putin as the evil autocrat hell-bent on exterminating Ukrainianas and destroying the world The eight-year preamble is not mentioned nor is the increasing presence of NATO in Russia \u2019 s near abroad .\nMeanwhile , the West keeps on sending more and more weapons and more and more money to the Ukraine : \u201c Western countries pledge $ 1.55 billion in military aid to Ukraine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Reuters on 11 August .\nAnd Ukraine \u2019 s current president has become a veritable media star in the West , befitting an actor and comedian propelled into presidential office .\nOn television , Volodymyr Zelensky played a character called Vasyl Petrovych Holoborodko \u2013 an absent-minded high-school history teacher who becomes president via the good offices of the internet .\nThe New York Times \u2018 TV critic , James Poniewozik asserted last March that , in real life , \u201c Mr .\nZelensky ran for president in a social-media-savvy campaign so tightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his political party was also called \u2018 Servant of the People \u2019 , \u201d like that of his fictional alter ego Holoborodko .\nFollowing the start of Russia \u2019 s \u201c special military operation , \u201d Zelensky has been using all of his acting skills to whip a veritable New Cold War hysteria predicated on Russophobia , a hatred of Russians and all things Russian that is on the verge of outright racism .\nAnd the audiences in the West are lapping up his words , admonitions and telegenix poses .\nPoniewozik explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up .\n.\n.\nas if Zelensky were a performance artist practicing his craft against a backdrop of Russian bombs and explosions .\nFar from the madding crowd , the U.S. President Joe Biden has committed a mere \u2018 $ 9 billion in U.S. military aid ; [ and ] more than $ 50 billion overall \u2019 to the Ukraine since the end of last February .\nWhile domestically , he has been struggling to pass bill to benefit Americans at home \u2013 the one exception being the so-called Inflation Reduction Act of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hail as the first stepping stone towards saving the world from \u2018 climate catastrophe.\n\u2019 As pointed out by the writer David Srirota on Twitter , the reality is rather different ( 6:16 pm 10 Aug 2022 ) .\nThe Irish campaigner , for independent journalism Chay Bowes points out that \u201c increasing numbers of mainstream journalists , commentators and ordinary individuals [ have ] rushed to \u2018 Stand with Ukraine \u2019 .\n\u201d While people on the street all around seem quite happy to voice their Russophobia , as illustrated by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Berlin elementary school attended by Russian children [ graffiti written on street ] : \u201c Let \u2019 s kill Russian kids !\n\u201d , \u2019 as documented on Facebook by a certain Leigh Fellner .\nRussia \u2019 s \u201c special military operation \u201d and subsequent armed conflict in the Ukraine sees \u201c the pro-Western media machine cultivate and disseminate disinformation , propaganda and fake news on a previously unseen scale , \u201d declares Bowes .\nThe Irishman next points out that \u201c the U.S. and its NATO allies prosecute [ a ] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air , and at sea , [ while ] another illicit battle is being fought on social media , TV and radio.\n\u201d The present crisis at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station in southeastern Ukraine \u2013 supposedly , the largest nuclear power plant in the whole of Europe \u2013 is telling in this instance .\nWhile the Russian authorities have occupied the plant since last March in order to secure the dangerous site and protect the world from another potential Chernobyl disaster , the propaganda machinery keeps pounding the message that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grounds of the nuclear facility \u2013 even writing this last sentence seems quite surreal , but that is what \u2019 s happening in the world today .\nThe revived Russophobia of yesteryear has apparently made the public believe that Russians are not human , but monsters capable of anything .\nWhile the media portray the utterly rational and extremely knowledgeable Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin as an unthinking caveman-like monster that wants to kill and destroy anyone and everything for no good reason other than sheer bloodlust and resentment : As I pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually intended \u201c to return Washington \u2019 s ship to its Pacific course that had first been set by Obama and his famous \u2018 pivot to Asia , \u2019 centred on China and the Pacific Rim.\n\u201d But before he could do that , the situation in the Ukraine blew up \u2013 a situation which is actually yet another holdover from the Obama adminsitration , as explained earlier .\nIn fact , the Obama-Biden continuity is all but personified by Victoria Nuland .\nWhile the U.S. and NATO are merely conducting a proxy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rather different for Russia , as announced by the Russian intellectual whom the West likes to vilify as a \u201c political scientist known as \u2018 Putin \u2019 s Rasputin \u2019 or \u2018 Putin \u2019 s Brain , \u2019 as well as an occult fascist.\n\u201d This man , Alexandr Dugin made a post on Facebook , significantly on 22 February 2022 : \u201c Long live Novorossiya !\nThe Great Slavic Reconquista Begins , \u201d with a link to his article carrying that very headline : Dugin \u2019 s usage of the term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the 18th and 19th centuries .\nThe French historian , sociologist , and political scientist , Dr Marl\u00e8ne Laruelle , gives a succinct definition as well as some contextual information : While Biden and his cronies think they are conducting a proxy-conflict in the New Cold War , as masterfully laid out by Manlio Dinucci , Putin and his men regard the conflict \u2018 next door \u2019 as an existential issue that will determine the very survival of Russia , as deftfully elaborated by Andrew Korybko .\nIn this context , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a New Cold War is a living actuality , a fact that seems to bypass most .\nThis reality has led to the re-configuration of alliances and oppositions \u2013 to what I \u2019 ve termed \u201c New Cold War Realignments \u201d in 2018 .\nThese new alliances stretch from east to west and from north to south : primarily Russia ( backed by Belarus , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , and Armenia or the Eurasian Economic Union/EEU ) and China ( in turn supported by India , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Russia , Pakistan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cooperation Organization/SCO ) ; with two more nations that at present are but somewhat loosely associated with the two juggernauts \u2013 Turkey and Iran .\nIn fact , rumour has it that the latter will formally join the SCO shortly , while the former seems to be dancing around between Washington and Moscow , while having a strategic partnership with the People \u2019 s Republic of China .\nThese realigned states are collectively facing up to the U.S. and its NATO allies in the EU .\nAs illustrated by President Trump \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapon , primarily against China , it stands to reason that the New Cold War rivalry also affects the economic life of the planet .\nAnd in this context the term \u201c de-dollarization \u201d pops up as a phenomenon that threatens Washington .\nSince the end of World War II , the U.S. Dollar has effectively been the world \u2019 s reserve currency .\nBut now , the \u201c New Cold War Realignments \u201d has led many to re-think the situation in order to abandon the dollar in favour of their local currencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : A Farewell to the American Empire Against this backdrop of growing American impotence in the face of new and different challenges , the U.S. seems to have strengthened its grip on the EU , which is now facing the prospect of a cold winter without cheap Russian gas .\nAlas , U.S. politicians don \u2019 t really care about Europe \u2019 s woes , instead preferring to focus on their own personal agendas .\nIn this vein , the now-octogenarian Speaker of the U.S. House , Nancy Pelosi decided to visit Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return the Biden White House to its intended renewed pivot to Asia .\nIn fact , Pelosi went a step further and threatened to visit the island of Taiwan \u2013 one of China \u2019 s red lines , as the People \u2019 s Republic regards the heirs of Chiang Kai-chek ( 1887-1975 ) as wayward children who need to return home .\nThe speaker landed on the island late Tuesday ( 2 August ) evening local time .\nAnd , minutes after Pelosi landed , China \u2019 s Eastern Theatre Command announced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as Tuesday in six zones encircling Taiwan .\nThese military operations reminded some commentators of what happened in the Ukraine last February , thus worrying that the Chinese would now do as the Russians did then .\nAlas , the military operations were but meant to frighten and send a message across the Pacific .\nStill , President Biden might very have gotten the message , but just 12 days after a visit by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , a delegation of American lawmakers arrived in Taiwan on Sunday ( 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AP .\nThis visit led to a similar Chinese reaction and now more Chinese military drills around the self-governing island are in the works .\nWhile the American influence is waning across the world , U.S. politicians like to behave as if they were still in charge , as if the Yankee Dollar were still everyone \u2019 s favourite lubricant , and the world but America \u2019 s backyard .\nBut , the world has changed , and changed forever .\nI would like to conclude by quoting the always eloquent and insightful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine and a veritable fount of geopolitical knowledge and analysis .\nHe puts forward that we are now living through an \u201c historical process , \u201d a process which encompasses the \u201c physical , psychic and moral cognitive degeneration \u201d of \u201c NATOstan \u2019 s manifest desperation in trying to contain Eurasia.\n\u201d For what Biden and his buddies do not seem to understand is the simple fact that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west .\nAnd at the moment , we are at near dark and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West ( or NATOstan , if you will ) dry .\n.\n.\nThis is the beginning of the Chinese century , as introduced by the Pelosi stunt \u2013 a century predicated on Eurasian integration and the completion of the New Silk Road that is China \u2019 s Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI ) .\n*** 21WIRE special contributor Dr. Can Erimtan is an independent

can also be a bloody sport , like hunting , bull-fighting , butchery of whales and so on .\nMaybe it is some sort of relic of ancient tradition of animal sacrifice .\nBut recently , we \u2019 ve

break down plastic waste , cut the carbon footprint of fertilizer production as well as capture and use carbon dioxide generated by industrial processes , \u201d added Taniike .\nAlthough scientifically speaking , it would be fascinating to dive further into what Toshiaki and his team have implemented , whilst appreciating their approach that combines two cutting-edge technologies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this piece , we will be looking at parallels between what was previously revealed in the globalists \u2019 One Health framework which is being promoted by the architects of the COVID-19 \u2018 global pandemic \u2019 , and the One Health climate change agenda , and those who are combining social engineering through the application of Big Data and AI .\nBelow we will be examining how One Health approach is used in combining all the doomsday computer model-based scenarios ( +AI ) currently used by the WHO and other sister UN agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technocrats in the World Economic Forum .\nAlthough the One Health approach is still in its adoption phase , this is not a major obstacle for globalist cleptocrats , as evidenced by the recent sidelining of actual scientific evidence by WHO Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , who effortlessly overruled the recommendations of his own panel of experts on declaring a health emergency for the relatively obscure condition known as \u2018 Monkeypox , \u2019 to declare on his own ( undoubtedly , inspired by the last pandemic ) unilateral \u2018 global health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c a public health emergency of international concern.\n\u201d What an epic scam .\nVideo : Media briefing on monkeypox with WHO DG Dr Tedros True scientists will always entertain a real scientific debate , and accept the constant state of re-evaluation , and promote forward-thinking , with the mission of helping their community to get closer to the truth .\nHowever , when it comes to the One Health approach , we are looking at a methodology employed by a corrupt scientific cult of \u2018 global public health.\n\u2019 The final leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover the very sensitive and complex subject of \u201c food security.\n\u201d No doubt you \u2019 ve probably heard this broad term by now , which comprises of food supply , food safety , and sustainable food production .\nGlobalist planners are hoping to nest the issue of food security neatly under the One Health Approach .\nNot surprisingly , this constant variable has now found its way into all of the latest computer models and equations now being used to justify \u201c global emergency \u201d measures at the United Nations level , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so-called leaders .\nPreviously , we investigated how the globalists and the United Nation Quadripartite ( WHO , FAO , OIE , UNEP ) had relentlessly worked at integrating One Health education into higher education curriculums in science , technology and social studies programs in order to build competencies in One Health language , and the requisite skills required to build and maintain vast networks through stakeholder institutions \u2013 supposedly designed to improve public health , environment health , food security and sustainable agriculture .\nThis is very much the epitome of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a global government structure .\nIn terms of delivering on its mission of public health , One Health appears to be a pre-digested concept that helps formulate a desired narrative by using computer modeling fed by an insatiable appetite for Big Data \u2013 which sadly removes the human dimension and often ground observations .\nMany of the scientists financed under One Health research seem to have willingly accepted this dogma , which is nothing more than obedience as career pragmatism .\nNothing new there , but none of this is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and methods used by the globalists to promote and over-exaggerate various threats posed by so-called \u2018 climate change \u2019 , and alleged

thus should be challenged at every turn .\nBack in 2013 , the World Organization for Animal Health ( OIE ) Director General Bernard Vallat , was promoting the One Health framework as the way to supposedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the environment itself .\nBut the adoption of such an approach at global , national and sub-national level has been hijacked , and inculcated into government and policymakers \u2019 minds for years .\nIt took around 20 years for us to start hearing leaders and presidents , and other high-level government officials using the term \u201c One Health \u201d \u2013 all promoting in unison , and marveling at its magical ability to predict and supposedly prevent all sort of disasters and national security threats which today have thrown the world into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nations Agency OIE , known today as the World Organisation for Animal Health ( WOAH ) , also uses a One Health approach to demonstrate how animal diseases can pose a threat to our food supply .\nThis , they claim , is a threat to our \u2018 global food security , \u2019 and to economic growth , or so they claim .\nYou can now see this is a desperate attempt to convince the policymakers of the World ( and the unelected operatives and influencers ) to address these issues in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or more likely to create ) the impending public health and food emergencies .\nIt \u2019 s quite a clever ruse , once you understand how all disciplines bounce off of each other for no valid reasons other than to provide an \u201c irrefutable data set , \u201d ready to re-feed into any subsequent computer model , which will certainly create the desired result which policy wonks are looking for .\nIf COVID-19 taught us anything , it \u2019 s that computer models can lead to unmitigated policy disasters .\nLike a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in creating and reinforcing any global emergency scenario which enables policymakers to justify the liberticide measures they are ( for most ) gladly enforcing upon their respective populations .\n.\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) , a One Health Food Security approach is essential for progress to \u2018 anticipate , prevent , detect and control diseases \u2019 that according to them spread between animals and humans .\nThe One Health approach is also deemed efficient to tackle antimicrobial resistance ( AMR ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as combating many other challenges relating to food security .\nThe globalist cult motto is : \u201c We are one world working together for One Heath \u201d The questions many are asking is : has One Health ever anticipated , prevented , detected or controlled any diseases ?\nWell , the answer is unfortunately not black and white , but the lack of any track record makes it hard to see any real benefits of such an AI and data-led approach , whilst leaving us pondering on the reasons why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shape the global security policies of a burgeoning new world order .\nIt seems a tremendous effort , with huge resources allocated , all to control the policies of tomorrow , presumably to accommodate the Schwabian Great Reset agenda , and the Fourth Industrial Revolution , and of course to comply with sanitary and phytosanitary standards of the World Trade Agreement ( WTO ) .\nAs part of their increased collaboration on One Health , the WHO Secretariat has worked closely with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop a One Health Joint Plan of Action ( OH JPA ) to guide the work of the four organizations so that they will operate under a \u201c One Health \u201d approach at a global , regional and country level .\nThe following draft One Health Joint Plan of Action ( 2022-2026 ) details the collaboration between FAO , OIE , UNEP and WHO as requested in Resolution WHA 74.7 and as required to take control of nations \u2013 while destroying them one piece at a time .\nIn other words : this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final development stages .\nAs shown in our previous articles on this subject , at the centre of this global network is the One Health High-Level Expert Panel ( OHHLEP ) .\nThis \u2018 stakeholder \u2019 steering committee gives the advice throughout the development of the OH JPA , as they seek to implement a \u2018 holistic and systematic approach \u2019 to solving these so-called man-made problems .\nThe United Nations quadripartite suggested that changes occurring in the natural environment due to climate change are now threatening and compromising \u2018 feed and food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread of infectious diseases \u2013 including zoonotic viruses , drug-resistant infections , and vector-borne diseases .\nThis is where they attempt to link climate change to food security under the One Health approach .\nThese experts now claim that changes in temperatures and humidity levels can expand vector populations beyond their present geographic ranges , and thus expose animals and humans to diseases to which they would have no natural immunity .\nOne Health allows computer-modeled projections and real world relationships to become interchangeable , and seem even reversible .\nAgain , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught us anything , it \u2019 s that allowing computer models to inform global public health policy \u2013 is an absolute road to disaster .\nIn their minds , this is cutting-edge technocracy : \u2018 high-level \u2019 interdisciplinary working groups using AI to solve the world \u2019 s challenges .\nIt sounds really good .\nOn one hand , mixing different scientific fields can open up an interesting debate , but unfortunately , as we now know , this high-flying technocracy approach offers way too much leverage for unscrupulous organisations and transnational corporations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as a Constant Emergency Creating Platform .\nMen have interacted with nature for millions of years , venturing in deep forest in the most remote part of the world \u2013 as hunters and gatherers , and yet we are still here alive and kicking , despite all odds , surviving drastic climate cycles ( cold and hot ) .\nSo what has truly changed and why so many catastrophic doomsday scenarios are suddenly being pushed into the public discourse ?\nThe OH JPA plan of actions ( pictured below ) are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is what one should expect when health , environment and food professional alarmists come together , and with the full financial backing so-called philanthropists , and their global corporations , banks , and eager government officials \u2013 always happy to dilapidate taxpayers \u2019 money in order to create an ideal policy framework that will benefit only these self-proclaimed oligarchs and their transnational corporate networks .\nOne Health Joint Plan of Action ( OH JPA ) During the course of our investigation we have also come to appreciate the role COVID-19 has played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why it was so crucial to have SARS-COV-2 released ( accidentally or not or even at all , depending on your set of believes ) to launch the real agenda of control hiding in plain sight .\nNone of these One Health public emergency remedies would make any kind of sense without COVID .\nTo portray the idea of climate change and food security as a \u201c Global Health Emergency , \u201d the globalists needed to create the fear of a persisting burden of things like endemic zoonotic , neglected tropical and vector-borne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all cleverly cooked up with a One Health recipe .\nI would go even further and say that COVID was and still is a distraction as the real agenda which is far scarier than a bad flu called COVID 19 with a survival rate estimated around 99.9 % .\nOf course , older people are more sensitive to the flu , so your chances of survival naturally vary according to your age .\nNo rocket science here .\nHaving said that , the main question still remains : Why was COVID-19 declared a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of the data available today support that claim ?\nI won \u2019 t discuss the vaccine here , as this is truly a legal matter that is currently being handled by many human rights lawyers , activists and scientists around the world , all of whom are defying the mainstream narrative and asking for transparency and justice as the elephant in the room can no longer be ignored .\nWe can debate for the next 30 years on the origin of COVID , but seeing the US reluctance to release the JFK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to change the definition of a vaccine , we see very little hope in getting to the bottom of that question .\nSo why not concentrate on the actual globalist agenda at hand , and focus our efforts on unmasking the One Health Agenda , a true threat to our democracy we should all be watching closely ?\nAccording to the FAO of the United Nations : \u201c Food security exists when all people , at all times , have physical and economic access to sufficient , safe and nutritious food that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an active and healthy life \u201d ( World Food Summit , 1996 ) .\nThis definition gives rise to four dimensions of food security : availability of food , accessibility ( economically and Physically ) , utilization ( the way it is used and assimilated by the human body ) and stability of these three dimensions .\nIn 2010 , the FAO and the WHO developed a document to assist countries ( members ) in the formulation and implementation of national food safety emergency response plans that are consistent with the risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety emergency-related programmes of FAO and WHO , namely the Emergency Prevention System for Food Safety ( EMPRES Food Safety ) , and the International Food Safety Authorities Network ( INFOSAN ) .\nWe will go back to INFOSAN in a moment .\nToday the FAO Strategic Framework 2022-31 articulates FAO \u2019 s vision of a sustainable and food secure world for all , in the context of the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development .\nThe forward of the following document is provided by FAO Director General Qu Dongyu who rapidly remind us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and its resulting economic impact , has put a strain on all countries as they strive to reach their UN Sustainable Development Goals , while containing the pandemic and its fallout .\nHe goes on saying that \u201c extreme climate events , trans boundary pests and zoonotic diseases , as well as conflicts continue to exacerbate the situation \u201d .\nMuch has been made of recent events about the global grain crisis allegedly caused by Ukrainian \u2019 s military conflict with Russia .\nThe general mainstream narrative is that Russia is causing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its bountiful harvests .\nWhile this is debatable , the fact remains that western leaders and their media arms are seizing on this perceived crisis in order to elevate the issue of food security as a prime directive of the globalist agenda .\nUkraine accounted for just under 9 % of global wheat exports in 2021 , according to the World Food Programme of the United Nations , hence , we found it quite politically motivated to place all blame on Russia , but certainly the Ukrainian conflict has somewhat exacerbated the global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , France and many other countries , saw sunflower oil deserting their supermarket \u2019 s shelves \u2013 with the government and the MSM quickly blaming the Russians \u2019 incursion into Ukraine for the empty shelves and maritime deliveries .\nEveryone was panicking , and the media were pumping the fear around the clock .\nUnfortunately for them , leading supermarket chains reacted promptly to say they were not forecasting a penury of it until July 2022 when perhaps ( and only perhaps ) a slow-down in global supply could be felt .\nWe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there is still no major shortage on the horizon .\nAs of the end of July , the global agricultural price supply index has remained relatively stable .\nSo what was it then ?\nA political instrumentalisation of a war to promote food insecurity , or more importantly to create fear ?\nA tonne of sunflower cost 640 euros in mid-February 2022 , compared to nearly 1,000 euros in April 2022 \u2013 as usual , someone is coining it in on the back of this conflict , whilst governments are using it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food insecurity campaigns .\nFAO introduces their new business model presenting the agri-food systems transformation plan as one of the key levers to unlock progress towards the entire Agenda 2030 \u2013 where of all these manufactured problems are blamed on the COVID , the climate change , the endless threat of new and exotic zoonotic diseases , and of course the Russia-Ukraine conflict .\nYet , they will never bring up the fact that US , UK and EU sanction policies designed to punish Russia are actually threatening fertilizer and other big agra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in affordable and stable quantities .\nAmid all this , we can still see how One Health is placed once more at the centre of the proposed industrial transformation to justify every single plan for action .\nThe following document provides great clues one how One Health is utilised in all major Biosecurity programmes .\nFor instance , here with the One Water One Health fit-for-purpose water quality programme , part of FAO priorities related to circular agriculture economy and \u2018 green cities.\n\u2019 This is a typical example on how the globalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as to bring them under the control of a future iteration of a One World Government , therefore extending the One Health approach to embrace all sectors being Animal and Plant Pests and Diseases ( APPD ) or Anti-Microbial Resistance ( AMR ) under a broader biosecurity programme .\nThey clearly have been working on this for a very long time .\nThe \u201c Best Production \u201d gap identified by the FAO in their BP3 One Health analysis ( Page 59 ) speaks for itself : Increasing losses to production and adverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biological threats , including zoonotic infections of pandemic potential and antimicrobial resistance ( AMR ) in the crop , animal and aquaculture sectors .\nThat is how they have instrumentalised COVID by fabricating the idea of a biological threat which was necessary in order to advance the new \u2018 Threat Based Economic Model \u2019 , which is why all current and future policy reforms will use One Health as the innovative and altruistic approach requiring countries with the use of legally bidding instruments such as treaties and other binding agreements , to relinquish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-determination to the United Nations .\nThe UN and its corporate and philanthropist partners are working relentlessly to gain control over the Global Health/Food/Environment Security Policies that govern the new litany of Emergency Responses , Preparedness and Prediction Measures for Pandemics , Potential Outbreaks , and other threats related to climate change , and \u2018 antimicrobial resistance \u2019 outbreaks .\nThe policies they are fighting for will allow them to gain greater control over nations and their people therein .\nThe One Health approach was always about Big Data and protocols that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vast amount of information that will be used unscrupulously to justify liberticide measures or push forward predictive models that will open the doors to corporate sharks and investment bankers always excited by an opportunity to increase their bottom line or create debts for their ledger .\nThe holistic One Health approach was privileged at a very early stage by the World Bank and now by the UN Quadripartite , as it allows the UN and its sponsors to fabricate the idea of an ongoing \u201c Global Food Crisis \u201d and the inflammatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health emergency known as COVID , but also the result of a Global Environment Emergency ( Climate Change ) exacerbated by conflicts ( Russia-Ukraine ) .\nThis is highly suspicious at best , especially when knowing that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , a major contributor to the WHO , has business interests in the very same sectors of activities all promoted with a One Health approach to Food Systems , Food Security and Sustainable Food Production .\nA mere coincidence ?\nTake a look below : Food safety and the One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Safety Authorities Network managed jointly by the food and agriculture organization of the UN , FAO , as well as the WHO is a global network launched in 2004 and according to them aims at fostering a global community of practice of food safety officials from around the world .\nThe sheer scope of this project is breathtaking : In this interview , Carmen Savelli Technical Officer at the Department of Food Safety and Zoonoses at the WHO , shares information about INFOSAN explaining how INFOSAN encourages a One Health approach and provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach during food safety emergency response .\nAccording to him , responding to food safety events requires One Health approach because the identification of the event can actually happen at any stage along the whole food chain , at the level of production , on a farm , for example , and all the way up to consumption and after consumption , when you have human cases of illness identified .\nThe global technocratic framework being constructed here is simply incredible : As mentioned in our previous articles , the main goal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not a central role in the shaping up of global health security policies , including the anticipated reforms of the 2005 International Health Regulations ( IHR ) .\nINFOSAN has members in 188 countries and its network is humongous , hence , they will have their fair share of weight in this transformation \u2013 especially in the implementation of what is to become a revised IHR .\n\u201c Infosan actually also supports the implementation of the International Health Regulations ( IHR ) \u201d says Carmen Savelli in his interview .\nSome of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2005 International Health Regulations ( IHR ) made on 27 May 2022 , allegedly to strengthen WHO preparedness for and response to health emergencies .\nIn Geneva , Switzerland the 194-nation members of the World Health Assembly approved a resolution that halves the two-year period for amendments to the International Health Regulations ( IHR ) to take effect down to just one year .\nWhy the rush ?\nMore on INFOSAN Members \u2019 Guide here .\n\u2018 The move was part of a highly technical package of US-proposed measures that picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kick starting the reform process in pandemic response , \u2019 states a article from Health Policy Watch .\nThere is very little doubt as to the role Colin McIff , Deputy Director of the Office of Global Affairs at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , has played in the IHR reforms agenda and of course he was applauded like a rock star when everyone gathered to approve the globalist proposal .\nIMAGE : Colin McIff , Deputy Director of the Office of Global Affairs at the U.S. Department of Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that these people are actually running away from something , or worried that something is about to catch up with them .\nNotice how everything in government since the early days of the COVID crisis has been done under an \u2019 emergency \u2019 procedure , and expect global health , food and environment security policies to conform to this trend .\nThe aim is to push for a package of reforms in anticipation of the World Health Assembly 77 in 2024 .\nNo doubt that all the globalist organizations , including Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working around the clock to convince policymakers and their stakeholders of the power of One Health .\nWhat I am trying to say here is that we have very little time to stop this masquerade before it becomes all legally binding under new international treaty reforms being implemented under various banners , like the law of the sea treaty , to be codified on various national and regional ( EU ) levels .\nSince One Health is closely linked with the lucrative new computer-modeled prediction business ( climate change , pandemic , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair that we ask ourselves if people or organisations such as the Rockefeller Foundation are blessed with the gift of foresight .\nBarely 5 months after the first news of COVID-19 invaded our TV screens , with fear peddlers all too happy to scare the public with some incredible death and case numbers , we witnessed a report worthy of the best fortune-tellers issued by the Rockefeller Foundation on July 28 , 2020 , explaining how the RF and their acolytes saw the opportunity and the obligation to transform the U.S. food system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , equitable , healthy , and resilient etc.\n, by shifting to a system that better integrates public-private and philanthropic solutions \u2013 to address America \u2019 s ( and likely the rest of the world \u2019 s ) intractable and growing nutrition insecurity .\nDid they know something we didn \u2019 t ?\nYou can read in their food policy report ( paper ) : \u201c While the opportunity to realize this vision has come to us under tragic circumstances , it has also inspired the kind of passion , commitment , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will be accomplished.\n\u201d \u201c To do so , stakeholders from across the food system and beyond must come together to drive transformational shifts in systems , policies , and practices .\nWe must collectively meet the moment to address immediate need while laying the foundation for the systemic and structural design of a transformed food system.\n\u201d What we can take away from this report is that lobbying for the transformation of food systems was clearly a priority for the Rockefeller Foundation \u2019 s agenda .\nThe report reads more like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their pilgrims \u2013 reminding them that time had come to \u201c reset \u201d the food system of the world .\nAccording to RF , Covid-19 has made it clear that despite the innovation , entrepreneurship , and dedicated efforts of many players across the supply chain , the overall food system does not promote healthy people , a healthy planet , or an \u2018 equitable \u2019 economy .\nThus , the time for a Great Reset had finally come , and bankers could throw their weight behind it , while our governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations into record-levels of debt ( if that is even possible ) and currency devaluation .\nYes , the people , not elites , would have to pay for the globalists \u2019 transformation .\nWhat is truly missing in this report is a slice of honesty where they could have mentioned the pharmaceutical and the chemical industry who made billions , if not trillions , on the back of the agri-food business , not to mention the companies who control everything you eat , drink or buy .\nNot surprisingly , only 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beverage brand in the world : I guess it is easier to blame everything on COVID or the Russians , and simply deny any responsibility for the systemic breakdowns we are now witnessing .\nWith the One Health approach , they will soon be back in business under the name of some friendly and altruistic foundations or companies boasting about how they have saved the World from a Global Food Security Emergency , selling us Bill Gates \u2019 synthetic beef , or vegan burgers from Swedish company Oumph that are said to taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe ultimate winners of the new \u2018 food security emergency \u2019 narrative are the global banking cartel .\nOn their website the World Bank Group explain how it works with partners to build food systems that can \u2018 feed everyone \u2019 \u2013 everywhere , every day by improving food security , while promoting \u2018 nutrition-sensitive agriculture \u2019 , and supposedly improving food safety .\nThe Bank is a leading financier of food systems .\nIn 2020 , there was $ 5.8 billion in new IBRD/IDA commitments to agriculture and related sectors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied an integrated \u201c One Health \u201d approach to managing risks associated with animal , human and environmental health .\nSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic , total World Bank Group financing has reached $ 272 billion , including $ 52.6 billion in the last quarter of FY22 .\nFor the 15 months from April 2022 to June 2023 , financing was expected to reach $ 170 billion .\nThe World Bank also houses the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program ( GAFSP ) , a global financing instrument that pools donor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to agricultural development across the entire value chain .\nLots of debt , and lots of profit to be made , and I will let you guess what happens when nations start defaulting on their loans .\nThe mercurial Fourth Industrial Revolution also uses a fear-based economic model , articulated around the One Health Agenda , in order to hide the fact that Schwab \u2019 s Great Reset is nothing less than a master plan to enslave nations with debts whilst creating more fictitious fiat wealth for elites to consolidate real assets .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ author Michael Pettis entitled , How Does Excessive Debt Hurt an Economy ?\nHe says : \u201c It is notable that in almost every case in history when a country \u2019 s rapid growth has been associated with even more rapid growth in its debt burden , the subsequent adjustment has always turned out to be far more difficult than even pessimists had predicted \u201d \u201c People have always systematically underestimated the positive impact on economic activity of rising debt and the negative ( and asymmetrical ) impact on economic activity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe that the future will be much different.\n\u201d The new economic model presented by the World Economic Forum , the World Bank and the United Nations Quadripartite , will , without a doubt , create fictitious wealth which is associated with rising debts and inflation , because it is usually the banking system or governments that funds soft budget entities .\nLet \u2019 s not be fooled here : they will be no redistribution of wealth , nor a cascading effect where taxpayers will reap the benefits of these grand public-private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always go \u2013 straight into the bankers \u2019 pockets and the political campaign coffers .\nGlobal Health , Food and Environment Security Policies will be shaped by these very same people or organisations to accommodate this obviously well-crafted heist .\nMichael concludes in his article that , \u201c The economic impact therefore lies not in the debt itself , but rather in the fictitious wealth it has created.\n\u201d This is how elites plan to reconsolidate their wealth , political power , and real assets .\nFollowing a One Health logic where climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health emergency ( see my previous article here ) , we needed to see if One Health had also been used to provide or justify the necessary data to push a narrative where climate change is also promoted as a food security emergency .\nIs \u2018 climate change \u2019 the engine or the cause of a food security emergency ?\nThe following Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) 2015 report brings together the computer model-based evidence from the UN \u2019 s IPCC , updated by the latest scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alleged knowledge and experience on the ground .\nIt is said to provide an overview of the cascading impacts of climate change on food security and nutrition , from physical impacts on agro-ecosystems to livelihoods and food security .\nFollow their logic , and you can see who this new power-grab will unfold .\nFAO uses IPCC over-exaggerated warming projections , assumptions and the hypothesis required to roll-out a One Health \u201c holistic approach \u201d which allow them to promote catastrophic scenarios where climate change brings a cascade of risks from \u2018 physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production , food chains , incomes and trade , with economic and social impacts on livelihoods and food security and nutrition.\n\u2019 Nothing is left out .\nWhen reading the document ( and in between the lines ) we sense a deeper agenda , which is mainly to transform , but also control agriculture systems and food systems globally .\nClimate change will be used to promote more international exchanges of genetic resources as countries would eventually seek to obtain \u2018 well-adapted \u2019 ( ideally genetically modified ) crops , livestock , trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to climate change in agriculture and food systems for food security and nutrition will need to be enabled by massive public-private investments , and binding agreements and policies , nailed into place by institutions in various regions , once more putting the banking system and their globalist organisations at the very for front of this manufactured \u2018 green \u2019 industrial revolution .\nHiding in the background are World Economic Forum stakeholders , always ready for action and planning , and immediate implementation of investment projects , especially those investments that require longer time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field of : forestry , livestock breeding , seed multiplication , R & D , innovation , and knowledge transfer to enable adaptation .\nThis is a technocrat \u2019 s playground , intentionally made to be too complex for any pleb , or even elected leader , to understand .\nSo we defer to \u2018 the experts.\n\u2019 Ask yourself this question : how the globalists could ever strive to form a One World Government , under its various guises such as the vaunted \u201c Rules-Based International Order \u201d , without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and water systems of the world , and their associated security policies requirements ?\nIt seems the way they have chosen to control these systems globally is by interfering with them , and climate change provides the perfect scapegoat used to justify such deep interference .\nThe One Health Agenda conveniently provides the added value of supplying the UN Quadripartite and the IPCC with the Big Data necessary to design their computer models that can project any scenario \u2019 s desired outcome .\nThe computer models then become the \u2018 science \u2019 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to justify a raft of new polices , and to secure more and more funding for such endeavors .\nIt \u2019 s akin to a self-licking ice cream cone .\nIf we stop questioning them and ourselves , all that is left for us to do is to \u201c trust their science \u201d .\nThis very alarmist report was compiled in 2015 with a One Health approach ( see page 15 ) examining the interface of Sustainable Agriculture , Food Safety , and Food Security by alleged climate change .\nThe report is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projections where climate change and the IPCC/FAO data ( if you believe in their accuracy ) predict everything , and justify these climate alarmists and the fearmongers \u2019 vision of the future .\nAs things stand , contrary to the long-running global warming hoax , the Greenland ice surface is actually continuing to gain in thickness , with an above-average accumulation ( following a pattern observed since 2017 , except for year 2019 ) , as confirmed by the climatic observational data of the Polar Portal in the Arctic ( this year recording @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month of June ) .\nIn his very short June 2022 article , S\u00e9bastien Renault analyzes Greenland \u2019 s factual data reported by the Danish Meteorological Institute ( DMI ) , describing the current phenomenon where the surface thickness of the Greenland polar ice sheet is actually increasing , a report curiously ignored by the main stream media .\nIt \u2019 s not difficult to see why the mainstream media routinely ignore any report like this : Photo 1 : Surface mass balance per day ( between 01/09/21 and 20/06/22 ) Photo 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( between 01/09/21 and 20/06/22 ) S\u00e9bastien remind us that it is indeed the heat of oceanic water currents , under double solar influence ( from above ) , and geothermal ( from marine subsoils ) , that contribute directly to the cyclical process of melting Arctic ice , which appears to have absolutely nothing to do with the amount of CO present in the atmosphere \u2013 a fact which perplexes climatists .\nHe explains : \u201c The imposture of climate change fearmongers , particularly with regard to the phenomena of melting ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tirelessly denounced .\nMore than ever today , at a time when such intergovernmental fraud is causing famine and impoverishment on a global scale , preventing hundreds of millions of people from meeting their basic energy and food needs.\n\u201d If you take climate change exaggeration out of the One Health approach , the entire concept suddenly falls apart , and thus , it can not justify most of the claimed doomsday computer model-based scenarios promoted 24/7 in our media and government reports .\nThis is why MSM will never give room to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meteorological Institute , as it will hinder the entire man-made global warming theory bandwagon , and of course all of their manufactured health , environmental and food emergencies .\nThe entire gravy train suddenly comes to a grinding halt .\nWe take this opportunity to direct you to a 21st century Wire article titled \u201c Despite Climate Doom Talk , Australia \u2019 s Great Barrier Reef is Blooming \u201d another topic that makes IPCC so called experts very uncomfortable .\nThe grand design of this globalist effort is the link food security to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretext to implement a global governance control mechanism over the world \u2019 s food supplies .\nThis is why exposing climate change propaganda and challenging the One Health concept is vital .\nThis is why it is now crucial to fight this intellectual battle , and to bring back real science into the conversation , but also promote real on the ground scientific work and empirical observations which do not leave space for the lies and deceit which have come to dominate this arena .\nIn this article , you will find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d and of course they have a lot to say about the over-exaggerated and wildly alarmist IPCC computer models .\nIvar Giaever , a Nobel Prize winner in physics sees climate change orthodoxy as a \u201c new religion \u201d for scientists whilst pointing to the fact that data isn \u2019 t nearly as compelling as it should be to get this kind of conformity the US Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) and the globalist would want to impose .\nLikewise , Princeton \u2019 s highly-respected physicist Will Happer is another one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is vastly overstated , and that the benefits of a modest reduction in it will be negligible .\nNo doubt one of the biggest climate skeptics is Myron Ebell , the former Director of Global Warming and International Environmental Policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute ( CEI ) .\nIn September 2016 , he was appointed by then Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to lead his transition team for the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) .\nMyron has been challenging the man-made global warming campaign and the proposed catastrophic prediction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Climate Change ( IPCC ) computer modelers .\nHe also , amongst many others , has denounced the \u2018 Climate Industrial Complex \u2019 greed \u2013 which doesn \u2019 t sit well with the globalists who quickly turned him into a \u201c climate denier.\n\u201d A modern day heretic .\nDoes that not remind you these top scientists around the world challenging the COVID-19 pandemic who where labeled \u2018 Anti-vaxxers \u2019 and \u2018 COVID deniers \u2019 \u2013 for challenging the experimental gene therapy injections which the globalists called \u201c vaccines \u201d ?\nThanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 ve all had an opportunity over the last past two and half years to see wild computer-modeled projections , and hear outrageous claims based on those same computer models , all predicting giant death tolls which thankfully never materialized .\nDo you see a pattern ?\nMost scientists ( including skeptics ) think the planet may be warming , and that humans may be playing a role in that process , but in reality , the vast majority of scientists don \u2019 t pay as much attention to it as we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between alarmists and skeptics is the impact of the alleged man-made CO2 , not whether we \u2019 re causing any measurable warming .\nThe only consensus that matters is whether scientists are actually concerned about climate change , and most scientists are simply not .\nFinally , there are many prominent scientists and scientific organizations who openly and consistently reject the idea that humans are causing a climate catastrophe , including climate experts with experience at MIT , Harvard , Columbia , Princeton , and the University of Pennsylvania , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world .\nOthers have served as official national climatologists or worked for major government agencies such as NASA and NOAA .\nAmong the many influential scientists who have questioned the causes and/or consequences of the so-called \u201c consensus \u201d on climate change are several giants of science over the past half century , such as Freeman Dyson , S. Fred Singer , Richard Lindzen , and Will Happer .\nThere are numerous others too , but these voices are systematically kept out of the MSM , and not invited to contribute to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , One Health is nothing else but a Trojan horse that once more allow the creation of a data set aiming at feeding the IPCC computer models used to support their alarmist global warming scenarios .\nThe following video from Cutting Through The Noise : Climate Science 101 with David Siegel , dated April 12 , 2022 ( 39 mins ) , and it is clearly a masterpiece which provides very valid points that explain the true state of the planet \u2019 s global warming .\nAgain , no one here is denying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it \u2019 s not near to what it was in the past , and certainly not as bad as the climate alarmist would like you to think .\nCutting Through The Noise : David Siegel Climate Science 101 v2 2 ( Please click on the video , it has not been replaced ) : We know that past CO2 levels got extremely high , and the data is available to show it , therefore establishing correlation between alleged man made CO2 and \u2018 green house \u2019 gas emissions and climate change is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument .\nOf course , many other factors come into the equation which potentially could disturb the earth climate , but evidently at a far slower pace .\nFor instance , solar cycles are arguably the most influential , but these are not used as inputs into the IPCC \u2019 s exotic modeling for man-made global warming .\nMany observations prompt us to better understand what happens if CO2 changes very quickly , over a period of time , while those other factors stay constant .\nThis is still an open question , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Powerpoint jockeys like Al Gore will have you believe .\nThe Expos\u00e9 published a great article about Climate Intelligence CLINTEL , a global network of critical scientists and engineers with a simple message : \u201c There is no climate emergency.\n\u201d In this article published on July 11 , 2021 by climatologist Judith Curry we can read : \u201c It is easy to simplify both the problem and its solutions .\nThe complexity , uncertainty and ambiguity of our knowledge of climate change are not taken into account in policy and public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and politically inapplicable on a global scale.\n\u201d \u201c More specifically , regarding climate science .\nClimate sensitivity ( reaction to a doubling of the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere ) is affected by an uncertainty factor of order 3 .\nThe alarming predictions of climate models for the 21st century are based on an emission scenario ( RCP8.5 ) that is highly implausible .\nClimate model predictions neglect natural climate variability , which dominates the regional climate on inter annual to multi-decadal time scales .\nFinally , reducing emissions will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 21st century , because if climate models are to be believed , it will only produce its effects in the 22nd century and likely even beyond.\n\u201d Again , it is vitally important to keep going back to the climate change debate , as it is inevitably linked to the One Health \u2018 food insecurity \u2019 scenario that is currently being pushed .\nAs the global climate warms slightly , crop yields in the U.S. and around the world are setting new records almost every year .\nThis is true for almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to \u2018 longer growing seasons , fewer frost events , more precipitation , and the fertilizing effects of atmospheric carbon dioxide , farmers are producing more food on less land , supporting a growing world population.\n\u2019 The 2019 global crop year saw record production of major crops such as maize , rice and wheat .\nIn addition , prior to 2019 , record crop yields have been set nearly every year for the past decade .\nMore notably , since 2015 , nearly all major U.S. crops have seen record yields per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Agriculture ( USDA ) , for instance , the USDA reported that the top three yields for corn were in 2017 and 2018 and 2019 .\nAdditionally , the top five recorded rice yields were from 2015 to 2019 , while the 2011 to 2019 wheat yields were among the top 10 historical U.S. wheat yields .\nSo global warming is not the enemy of food security .\nQuite the opposite .\nIn 2020 , these trends continue globally .\nThe United Nations \u2019 Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production rose 1.3 % compared to 2019 , despite production restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic .\nSo it \u2019 s pretty clear : global warming is extending growing seasons , reducing frost events and making more land available for crop production .\nAs global temperatures have risen slightly , global soil moisture has remained unchanged or slightly improved , and increased ocean evaporation has led to increased global precipitation , especially during the summer and autumn harvest periods .\nIn addition , carbon dioxide acts as plant food , and thus has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carbon dioxide acts as an aerial fertilizer .\nHigher atmospheric carbon dioxide levels support plant growth and resistance to drought and heat .\nFor this reason , greenhouses often take in more carbon dioxide .\nSo why should we fear climate change ?\nWhy should we fear food shortage ?\nWEF and the Global structure of Food Innovation Hubs Let \u2019 s now take a look at Klaus Schwab \u2019 s other project .\nHere \u2019 s what the alarmists at the World Economic Forum ( WEF ) are proposing to reinvent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nA growing set of global players from private and public sector drive and support an initiative known as the Food Innovation Hubs , supported by a Global Coordinating Secretariat ( GCS ) , and hosted by World Economic Forum , based in Wageningen in The Netherlands .\nAccording to their summary , the GCS enables the founding of local hubs , supports their functioning , stimulates adoption of innovation and creates a global network and learning environment .\nThe first of these Food Innovation Hubs are being developed in countries like Colombia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn addition , \u2018 scoping work \u2019 is well underway in several countries in Africa \u2013 in Zambia , Kenya , and Ethiopia , and also in Vietnam .\nEach of these \u201c hubs \u201d will be locally owned and governed , or so they say .\nThe WEF Food system initiative in collaboration with the global consultancy firm McKinsey & Company ( remember them ) one of the big winner of the COVID-19 pandemic provides a great clue as to what it is to be expected right now and in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Economic Forum has identified so-called \u201c transition pathways \u201d necessary for food systems transformation which requires several of these technocracy transitions .\nThese transitions necessitate a fundamental change in the way food is produced ( including in agri-industrial operations as well as in the practices of more than 500 million smallholder farmers around the world ) , and of course a need for farmers to adopt more \u201c sustainable farming practices , \u201d and to \u201c protect and restore natural resources , \u201d and to \u201c meet the nutrition needs of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should sound familiar by now .\nA huge transition will be required to meet the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs , but at what cost for people ?\nHowever , the Schwabians are telling us that governments have provided approximately $ 570 billion per year in public support for agricultural producers to meet development imperatives related to their \u2018 food security \u2019 canard , by not without sufficient focus on climate , nutrition and health outcomes ( One Health in action right here ) .\nNOW FOR THE NUDGING : They also go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove incentives that have the perverse effect of preventing those in the food system from changing their behaviour .\nThis is taken straight out of the WEF Behavioural Sciences | Strategic Intelligence agenda and here is how it looks like : This following report focuses on WEF Food Systems Initiative who recommended four \u2018 pathways \u2019 for creating the incentives needed to transform food systems .\nIt \u2019 s truly worth the read just to observe the architecture of control \u2013 the very essence behind their proposed \u2018 transformation.\n\u2019 When the food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will become accustomed to companies like IMPOSSIBLE ( fake meat ) selling you the magical and juicy plant based IMPOSSIBLE BURGER or SAUSAGE or CHICKEN NUGGETS .\nNote that their slogan is \u201c ONE Team One Mission \u201d .\nThey could have just as easily added One Health .\nListen to their interview on the WEFORUM of the WEF discussing whether we have reached \u201c the end of meat \u201d \u2026 The Impossible Burger promotional talk on the WEF Forum radio show : With more WEF food system incentives , the City of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fresh salad and vegetables freshly grown in the world \u2019 s first underground farm , 33 meters below the capital .\nThis is one of the solutions being proposed to feed our growing population , and to combat the threat of climate change .\nAs the rhetoric continues to reach galactic levels , it leaves one speechless and sad , especially when thinking about the Dutch farmers , but also the rest of the European farmers currently fighting against this cabal to preserve their traditions and livelihoods .\nThis is what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on behind the scene \u2013 which is nothing else but the destruction of farming and food as we know it , consuming in its path all of the jobs , businesses , and families \u2013 by shaping and lobbying for new European policies to fit the new Big Food industry , which harnesses Big Tech and Big Data business models .\nThis really is Built Back Better in action , and it will leave a trail of corpses in its wake if we don \u2019 t act now .\nThe situation in Holland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , supported by some of the most corrupt European technocrats and EU states government officials , under the leadership of WEF , to ensure the 2019 Green Pact or Green New Deal will further their agenda .\nSuffice to say , it is important that people read these documents and understand the origins of what we are currently seeing in The Netherlands , and also why it is suspiciously not being reported by the mainstream media .\nThe European Green Pact : Doc1 and Doc2 , is the initial roadmap of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their European Green Deal .\nThe Climate Agreement , presented in The Hague , on 28 June 2019 , is the real the nail in the coffin for the Dutch farmers , as it allows \u2018 climate change \u2019 to justify the slashing of Nitrogen Oxide and ammonia emissions by 2030 .\nThis is a recipe for disaster for traditional farming in The Netherlands \u2013 which is the world \u2019 s second-most productive agricultural nation .\nHere is what the corrupt Dutch government agreed for the farmers and people of The Netherlands\u2026 I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is well explained in the above document regarding the emission reduction in livestock farming in The Netherlands .\nThere is an emphasis on voluntary participation in measures , with a view to ensuring that the reduction achieved via these measures helps to reinforce the \u2018 ecological value \u2019 in the \u201c Natura 2000\u2033 areas , and half of developments in the livestock farming sector .\nThe national government will make \u20ac100 million available for this purpose .\nBut what is Natura 2000 exactly ?\nNatura 2000 is the EU wide network of nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure the survival of Europe \u2019 s most valuable species and habitats .\nIt is not restricted to nature reserves , but based on a much broader principle of conservation and sustainable use , where \u2018 people and wildlife can live together in harmony.\n\u2019 Yeah !\nRight ( they just don \u2019 t want to see people there ) !\nBy the end of 2008 , the network consisted of more than 25,000 sites , covering around 20 % of the total land area of the EU \u2014 around 800,000 km2 \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 2017 in Europe , the network represented 27,522 sites and covers 18 % of the land and 6 % of the exclusive economic zone .\nAs of March 1 , 2017 , France had 1,766 sites , covering nearly 13 % of metropolitan land territory and 11 % of the metropolitan exclusive economic zone .\nNatura 2000 in the Netherlands clearly indicates \u2018 the urgency of reducing nitrogen levels \u2019 in Natura 2000 areas .\nDo you believe this is a coincidence ?\nAfter Marine Protected Area ( MPA ) we now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( LPA ) under the \u2018 Rules of the World Order \u2019 .\nTake a look at page 3 of the following document and realise for yourself how the NWO is securing lands for themselves under the disguise of biodiversity , bird and habitat preservation .\nNine biogeographical regions were identified , Alpine , Atlantic , Black Sea , Boreal , Continental , Macaronesian , Mediterranean and Steppic .\nYou are not very welcome there .\nInstead you will be herded into one of their mega \u201c smart cities \u201d to eat their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , consuming their green energy , and obeying there laws , as well as their \u2018 science \u2019 , and everything else\u2026 .\nSome of you might have heard of the Tristate City Network in The Netherlands , a mega-city \u2018 umbrella model \u2019 developed by Peter Savelberg , which aim is to put The Netherlands \u2018 on the map \u2019 as a large green metropolis , bringing together Randstad , but also including direct neighbouring countries such as Flanders and Nord Rhein Westfalen Germany .\nOf course , the globalists are loving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the notion of nation and sovereignty , and replaces it by the idea of the quintessential mega-city of the NWO , an idea which has been trending for quite some time .\nIt is not clear if Tristate City is somehow linked with the EU Green Deal , but for sure this project has secured government and private sector support .\nWe will keep an eye on it\u2026 Moving on , it feels real good to see the Dutch and German farmers are fighting back against government \u2019 s EU Green Deal agenda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nLikewise , Italy has also been part of this protest movement for a while , and it is only a matter of time before France falls under the same sanctions and restrictions .\nAnd so the push-back should be epic too .\nAdding insult to injury , Sky News Australia recently release a video where Mr Dean said The Netherlands \u2019 government planned to cut emissions between 30 and 70 per cent \u201c as part of their green agenda \u201d .\nAdding , \u201c Completely arbitrary bureaucratic madness , but this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d he said .\n\u201c The little people , the farmers , the small businesses get crushed under the wheels of the bureaucrats who believe they are \u2018 saving the planet \u2019 .\n\u201d Subsequently , we couldn \u2019 t resist showing you what Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte , Prime Minister of The Netherlands , had to say about the WEF Innovation Hubs , which he describes as an \u2018 inventive agricultural solution \u2019 during the \u201c Transforming Food Systems and Land Use \u201d panel , at the World Economic Forum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health Approach is also being used by the environmentalists and climate alarmists , by applying what they have come to call \u201c Environmental Stressors \u201d \u2013 such as Land Use Change , Biodiversity Decline , Climate Change , Ecotoxicity and Chemical Pollution , Air Pollution , Water Pollution and finally Ocean Pollution .\nThese are new metrics of the globalist technocracy .\nThis 2022 WHO/Europe report entitled \u201c A health perspective on the role of the environment in One Health \u201d is truly revealing as it allows us to see how such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push climate change into an equation where our health and food supply is suddenly now in danger because of supposed emerging \u2018 environmental and climate change factors.\n\u2019 The WHO global strategy on health , environment and climate change , promotes multiple scenarios where the alleged consequences of global environmental change , including the over-exaggerated climate change and biodiversity loss justifies \u2018 cross-sectoral emergency action plans \u2019 in the field of land use and planning in agriculture , industry and energy .\nAll this because they care about your health ?\nThey are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pharma and Big Food to corner you in a complete dependency state where people will be used as constant guinea pigs , whilst our farmers will lose their lands and livelihood .\nA One Health Approach allows these very scientists to use any losses of diversity , including genetic diversity and transform it into a very serious threat to global food security suggesting it undermines resilience to threats such as pests , pathogens but also to climate change .\nThey will use anything to fit their models and associated agenda .\nThis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this 2022 WHO/Europe report \u201c Climate change is a \u201c threat multiplier \u201d to other environmental problems , a human health threat and a driver of biodiversity decline .\nClimate change alters habitat conditions , driving organism migration to higher latitudes and altitudes .\nMigration of species disrupts synchronicity between interacting species and changes tropical cascades .\nSuch changes may interfere with natural control of wildlife populations and cause outbursts of disease vectors or host species ( Patz & Hahn , 2012 ) .\n\u201d \u201c Increasing temperatures drive range expansions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticks , aphids and mosquitoes ) and of zoonotic hosts by facilitating survival in higher latitudes and altitudes ( as in the case of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes ) .\nSeveral neglected tropical diseases can now be found at higher latitudes.\n\u201d Their message is clear : we should all be scared .\nWHO Europe : A health perspective on the role of the environment in One Health As we have seen all along this article , the One Health agenda can explain the architecture behind the renewed globalist technocracy movement , but mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the Big Data necessary to pour into computer-generated forecasting models that help the globalists framing their new and constantly changing global health and food security policies designed to gain control over the world \u2019 s food systems , healthcare systems , the ecosystem , and the energy systems of the world , and by doing so , controlling all of us all in the process .\nRemember what globalist luminary Henry Kissinger once said to the World Economic Forum : This One Health trilogy has been a learning curve for me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same for anyone who has taken the time to read and understand this .\nThe One Health subject has never been touched upon seriously by the mainstream media , and for good reason , as it would reveal the brainchild and the primer behind the gigantic \u2018 global pandemic \u2019 fraud we were all forced to endure , as well as elites \u2019 deliberate efforts in steering any future food , climate and energy security crises , which has become the Vaudeville we are currently being forced to watch and play a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNow and in the future , be aware that most of the projects and products promoted under the term \u201c One \u201d are likely to be part or the result of this same globalist agenda .\nWe hope that in years to come , One Health will be revisited and scientists will be able to better understand the motivation behind such a cunning approach , and understanding that it was only promoted within the scientific community to streamline an emerging global scientific dictatorship , one where no more questions will be asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be compelled to follow technocratic protocols without challenging their very nature and their scientific foundations .\nIt will get worse before it gets better , and scientists from all fields need to go back to basic science , and step away from the \u2018 prediction business \u2019 as it is currently killing people , and in the medium to long term it will eventually depopulate our beautiful planet could provide elites with the pretext to spawn a new \u2018 designer \u2019 race of genetically modified humans .\nMany will argue that such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in

wisdom propagated by Western government and corporate approved information outlets .\nSo political and intellectual argument in North America and Europe has become ever more narcissistic ,

assumptions of Western superiority .\nOver the last fifteen years or so a growing number of independent writers and reporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread by well coordinated and concentrated corporate and government controlled networks of mutually reinforcing information outlets .\nThis development has notably sharpened the relation between information and class .\nMore clearly than ever the production

censor independent reporting confirm the wholesale abandonment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nA principal criterion for appraising rationality in an individual or a society is precisely their ability and self-confidence in making a case against rival arguments .\nAttempts at outright censorship , or the many other kinds of arbitrary intellectual and cultural repression deployed , represent a failure

barefaced lie .\nI know facts are unfashionable with the medical establishment these days but the hard evidence shows quite conclusively that the polio vaccine has endangered vast numbers of healthy people , still kills healthy people and played no part in eradicating the disease .\nProof that the introduction of the polio vaccine wasn \u2019 t the success it is often made out to be isn \u2019 t difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the number of polio victims the year before vaccination became compulsory was 119 .\nThe year after vaccination was introduced the figure rose to 386 .\nIn North Carolina , the number of cases before vaccination was introduced was 78 , while the number after the vaccine became compulsory rose to 313 .\nThere are similar figures for other American states .\nIf you don

immunisation .\nThe number of deaths from polio had fallen dramatically before the first polio vaccine was introduced .\nThe truth is that as with other infectious diseases the significance of polio dropped as better sanitation , better housing , cleaner water and more food were all made available in the second half of the 19th century .\nIt was social developments rather than medical ones which increased human resistance to infectious diseases .\nBut the profitable vaccine is still popular .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ unheard of in many countries .\nBut every year there are cases of paralysis probably caused by the oral polio vaccine .\nHowever , whether or not the polio vaccine actually works is , for many people , a relatively unimportant health issue .\nOf far more significance is the fact ( revealed in my book Why Animal Experiments Must Stop in 1991 ) that millions of people who were given polio jabs as children in the 1950s and 1960s may now be at a greatly increased risk of developing cancer .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the development of a poliomyelitis vaccine was made in 1949 with the aid of a human tissue culture , when the first practical vaccine was prepared in the 1950 \u2019 s monkey kidney tissue was used because that was standard laboratory practice .\nResearchers didn \u2019 t realise that one of the viruses commonly found in monkey kidney cells can cause cancer in humans .\nIf human cells had been used to prepare the vaccine ( as they could and should have been and as they are now ) the original poliomyelitis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bone , brain , liver and lung cancers have all been linked to the monkey kidney virus SV40 and something like 17 million people who were given the polio vaccine in the 1950s and 1960s are probably now at risk ( me included ) .\nMoreover , there now seems to be evidence that the virus may be passed on to the children of those who were given the contaminated vaccine .\nThe SV40 virus from the polio vaccine has already been found in cancers which have developed both in individuals who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the children of individuals who were given the vaccine .\nIt seems inconceivable that the virus could have got into the tumours other than through the polio vaccine .\nThe American Government was warned of this danger back in 1956 but the doctor who made the discovery was ignored and her laboratory was closed down .\nSurprise , surprise .\nIt was five years after this discovery before drug companies started screening out the virus .\nAnd even then Britain had millions of doses of the infected polio vaccine in stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government withdrew the vaccine and so it was almost certainly just used until it had all gone .\nNo one can be sure about this because in Britain the official records which would have identified those who had received the contaminated vaccine were all destroyed by the Department of Health in 1987 .\nOddly enough the destruction of those documents means that no one who develops cancer as a result of a vaccine they were given ( and which was recommended to their parents by the Government ) can take legal action against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so full of surprises .\nMy only remaining question is a simple one : How do these bastards sleep at night ?\nOh , I do have one other question .\nDid your doctor , practice nurse or eager health visitor mention any of this when

"Eighteen months ago I argued that those doctors and nurses giving the covid-19 jab would be tried as war criminals .\nI wasn \u2019 t surprised when I was attacked viciously by mainstream journalists and so-called self-appointed \u2018 fact checkers \u2019 .\nBut I stand by everything I said and wrote in February 2021 .\nHere , again , is what I said then : \u2018 I see that David Lammy , MP , a British politician , now says that the covid-19 vaccine is safe and it works .\nHe is the latest in a long and growing list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine \u2013 though I rather fear that they have probably spent as much time looking into the facts of the vaccine as I have spent learning about flower arranging .\nJust how Mr Lammy claims to know that the vaccine is safe and works is beyond me .\nLet me tell you about Mr Lammy .\nWhen he appeared on television quiz show he was asked to give the married name of scientists Marie and Pierre who won the Nobel Prize for physics in 1903 for their work on radium .\nLammy \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marie Curie mixed up with Marie Antoinette .\nWhen he was asked for the name of the building used as a prison by Cardinal Richelieu , he named Versailles instead of the Bastille .\nVersaille , for heaven \u2019 s sake !\nThis is a man who served as a government minister .\nHe was asked who succeeded to the English throne after Henry VIII and offered Henry VII which showed a singular lack of mathematical skills .\nAnd he once criticised the BBC for wondering whether the smoke from the Vatican would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think there was an element of racism in this well-known way of announcing if a new Pope had been elected .\nThe thing about Lammy is that to me he doesn \u2019 t seem aware of the extent of his ignorance .\nHe knows the covid-19 vaccine is safe and works because maybe he read it on a beer mat .\nOr maybe he has been conducting secret private clinical trials in his purpose built laboratory .\nMaybe he \u2019 s got a time machine which enables him to see into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covid-19 vaccine is safe and it works because someone in the Government says it \u2019 s safe and it works .\nLammy is supposed to be a member of Her Majesty \u2019 s Opposition .\nHis job is to question the Government and to protect his constituents .\nBut he has rolled over and let Bill Gates , Prince Charles and Klaus Schwab tickle his tummy .\nIncidentally , I am well aware that a decent part of the medical and scientific community doesn \u2019 t believe that the stuff currently being promoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vaccine at all .\nFor the record I agree with them .\nIt \u2019 s a form of gene therapy .\nI \u2019 d rather die than have that stuff in my body .\nBut if I don \u2019 t call it a vaccine people who trust David Lammy , the Archbishop of Canterbury and the rest of the ` roll over tickle my tummy and I \u2019 ll say whatever you want me to say \u2019 celebrities won \u2019 t know what I \u2019 m talking about .\nThe fact is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccines to help reduce the extent of the symptoms .\nThey \u2019 re not promising that the vaccine will stop people getting covid-19 and they \u2019 re not expecting the vaccine to stop people spreading the infection if they do get it .\nIf David Lammy and the Archbishop of Canterbury had done a little research they would know that .\nThey would also know that the vaccine is experimental .\nThe enthusiastic celebrities are promoting an experimental vaccine \u2013 or an experimental whatever it is .\nThe United States National Library of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently under way and they say that the trial will last two years .\nAnyone having the vaccine is themselves taking part in an experiment .\nDavid Lammy and the Archbishop of Canterbury want your granny to take part in an experiment .\nAnd your granddad .\nAnd you too .\nThe medicines agency in the UK knows that it \u2019 s an experiment .\nThey advertised for special software so that they could keep track of the high number of adverse events they were expecting .\nOf course , even after two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what \u2019 s going to happen to people who have the vaccine .\nOr what might happen to any children they might manage to have .\nIt \u2019 s all a mystery \u2013 though we do know that there are very real risks of changes to the immune system of those having the vaccine .\nBut it \u2019 s OK , David Lammy and the Archbishop of Canterbury say it \u2019 s OK .\nThey read it somewhere .\nOr someone told them .\nOr they saw a government advertisement .\nI bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they didn \u2019 t actually look through scores and scores of scientific papers before coming to that conclusion .\nI bet they didn \u2019 t make up their own minds before telling millions of people to take the bloody vaccine .\nThey just repeated the garbage they were told .\nGarbage in , garbage out .\nThe fact is that no one \u2013 not even David Lammy \u2013 can possibly know if the vaccine is safe and effective because the trial is still under way .\nYou can look at the paper yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Library of Medicine .\nLook for clinicaltrials.gov .\nAnd you \u2019 ll see , on page 3 of 14 , that the trial , or study , is expected to be completed on 31st January 2023 .\nCan you understand that , David ?\nIt \u2019 s an experiment .\nIt \u2019 s not over yet .\nNo one knows what is going to happen in two years .\nBut vaccine loving Bill Gates \u2013 whose foundation is making a fortune \u2013 wants seven billion people to take part in the experiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that thousands of people who have had the vaccine have died or been seriously injured by it .\nThat \u2019 s an undeniable fact .\nElderly people in care homes are dying in huge numbers .\nWe \u2019 re told it \u2019 s the infection but it \u2019 s not , of course .\nIt \u2019 s the damned vaccine they \u2019 re being given .\nNow , let me tell you something else .\nAnd this should strike terror into every doctor , nurse or boy scout currently involved in giving or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on medical experimentation , written in 1947 for reasons which I hope I don \u2019 t have to explain even to David Lammy , stated that explicit voluntary consent from patients is required for human experimentation .\nThat means that patients must be told that they are taking part in a trial .\nAnd they must be warned of all the possible adverse events .\nThat \u2019 s what informed consent means .\nHow many doctors and nurses jabbing people with this stuff are telling patients that it is a trial ?\nHow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to make a judgement ?\nI would guess somewhere close to none .\nAnd so , legally , all those people giving vaccinations are war criminals .\nWar criminals never think they are war criminals , of course .\nAt the end of World War II , the Nazis mostly claimed they were doing important work .\nOr just obeying orders .\nDoing what they were told .\nNone of that cuts the mustard , as they say .\nJust doing what you \u2019 re told doesn \u2019 t stop you being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear , everyone giving the covid-19 vaccines without explaining that it \u2019 s an experiment , and without listing all the possible adverse events , is a war criminal .\nIf you don \u2019 t believe me , check it out for yourself .\nWar crimes are still taken fairly seriously , these days .\nA lot of doctors and nurses are going to find themselves in the dock .\nAnd the people who endorsed the work they were doing may well find themselves there too .\nWhat \u2019 s the punishment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the activities of a war criminal ?\nMeanwhile , those who believe David Lammy , the Archbishop of Canterbury and the other celebrities who have said that the covid-19 vaccine is safe and effective should know that the vaccine is turning out to be just as dangerous as I and other doctors warned it would be .\nIt was obvious before Christmas that these vaccines would kill and injure millions .\nFor the proof , watch my previous videos or read the transcripts on my website www.vernoncoleman.com Governments and government agencies are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are dying and suffering awful neurological problems just happened to die or fall ill .\nThey are claiming that the vaccine isn \u2019 t responsible .\nThey claim that if you die within 28 days of a fake test for covid-19 then you died of covid-19 .\nThe bus that ran you over had nothing to do with it .\nBut they claim that if you die within 28 hours of having the jab then it \u2019 s a coincidence .\nWhat bastards these people are .\nThey lie , lie and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When is the world going to wake up ?\nIn America , courts have confirmed that deaths that occur 30 or even 50 years after an injury can be the result of the injury .\nTo give but one example , in 1982 , James Brady was shot by a man called Hinckley who tried to assassinate Ronald Reagan .\nBrady died in 2014 and his death was put down as a result of homicide .\nIt isn \u2019 t for government agencies to decide that deaths are coincidental .\nCoroners should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquests on every patient who dies within 28 days or even longer of having a covid-19 vaccination .\nBut there won \u2019 t be .\nMeanwhile , we have a horrifying avalanche of evidence showing that these damned vaccines are killing and maiming people \u2013 all for a disease which is proved to be no more dangerous than the annual flu .\nI have read many , many reports of the deaths caused by the vaccines .\nYou can see details of the deaths on my website under the heading ` How Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no doubt in my heart or in my mind .\nHow much longer are people going to be silent ?\nHow many must die ?\nHow many must be crippled ?\nWhen will people like David Lammy admit that they \u2019 re

decisions made by Western nations , Putin said .\nThe West caught \u201c sanctions fever \u201d as it sought to impose its will on other nations .\nAccording to the president , though this is nothing new , the current situation is marked by special circumstances \u2013 the US is losing its dominance in the global economy and politics , a \u201c tectonic shift \u201d that Western elites are not willing to acknowledge .\n\u201c Western nations want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits only them , to make everyone follow the \u2018 rules \u2019 they invented themselves and which they regularly break or change to their benefit , \u201d Putin said .\nResistance from other nations \u201c makes Western elites to \u2018 lash out \u2019 and take shortsighted cavalier decisions affecting world security , politics , and economics \u201d he added .\nWestern leaders are \u2018 detached \u2019 from their people The policies adopted by the leaders of the US and its allies run counter to the public \u2019 s interests , which they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western elites are \u201c detached from their own people , \u201d according to Putin .\nEU governments are a good example \u2013 they decided to decouple their economies from Russia , denying their businesses affordable energy and access to the Russian market , which makes them unable to compete , he said .\nPutin predicted that American companies would lead the charge to capture the market shares of businesses based in the EU as a result .\n\u201c When [ the Americans ] pursue their interests , they don \u2019 t limit themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global economic crisis will hurt vulnerable nations worst of all , according to the president \u2013 for many people , it \u2019 s a life-and-death situation , as impoverished countries will have no ability to buy crucial products .\nMeanwhile , Western nations pretend they want to help while only doing what is in their own interests , as exemplified by the Ukraine grain export deal , according to Putin .\nRussia agreed to help ships loaded with grain to leave Ukrainian ports under an arrangement mediated by Turkey and the UN in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships have gone to EU nations rather than struggling countries , the president said .\nSEE ALSO : West deceived poor nations with Ukraine grain deal \u2013 Putin \u201c Just two ships out of 87 were loaded [ in Ukraine ] under the UN Food Program , which works to provide assistance to needy countries\u2026 just 3 % that were sent to developing nations.\n\u201d According to Putin , Western nations have decades and even centuries of experience in

West \u2019 s \u201c economic , financial and technological aggression \u201d relatively well , Putin said .\nHe noted that the country \u2019 s financial system had been stabilized , inflation is going down , and unemployment is at record lows .\nSome companies were indeed hurt , especially those whose business depended on Europe in some way , he said .\nThe Russian government has mechanisms in place to support them .\nMost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( APAC ) reject \u201c the destructive logic of sanctions \u201d and seek to foster business ties and economic growth for the benefit of their people , Putin said .\nRussia appreciates players that share its attitude to national sovereignty .\nThe abundance of countries like this in APAC is \u201c its great competitive advantage \u201d and a source of long-term development .\nRussia did not start the conflict in Ukraine When asked by the host for comments on how the crisis in Ukraine has affected Russia , he reiterated Moscow \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @

Records", "content": "Your humble author , as promised , is involved in litigation to extract records from the federal government .\nIt \u2019 s easy to talk about current events .\nThe more difficult part is suing federal agencies for documentation of their wrongdoing .\nThis involves initiating FOIA requests , which are rarely answered quickly or completely .\nOut of our 75+ FOIA requests from this past year , only one was answered quickly and fully .\nA small miracle .\nThat was where we obtained CDC e-mails disclosing how they changed the definition of \u201c vaccine \u201d because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mRNA vaccines .\nIt \u2019 s a must-read if you haven \u2019 t seen it already ( even if it got us wrongly flagged on the Carnegie Mellon University COVID-19 \u201c misinformation \u201d watchlist ) : CDC Emails : Our Definition of Vaccine is \u201c Problematic \u201d Then there are the records we must fight for .\nOne development we can divulge is our effort to obtain the FBI \u2019 s records on Jeffrey Epstein .\nWe made a simple request : hand over all FBI interviews with Epstein .\nWe know those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the first to report that Epstein had been a source for the FBI .\n( It was later confirmed that Epstein cooperated on a Bear Stearns investigation . )\nBut we \u2019 re not convinced that was the only time Epstein spoke with the FBI .\nThere were other hints and rumors that he worked with the US government to recover stolen funds .\nThus the FOIA request .\nHow did the FBI respond ?\nNot by denying the existence of any records .\nInstead , the FBI is hiding behind FOIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the production of the Epstein records would interfere with ongoing law enforcement investigations : We \u2019 re exceedingly doubtful that the release of the Epstein records would \u201c interfere with enforcement proceedings.\n\u201d Ghislaine Maxwell has been convicted and Epstein is dead .\nThe only potential tie might be from a grand jury investigation into \u201c other possible co-conspirators of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\u201d But that was from the summer of 2020 and we rightly assume no charges were brought against whoever was being investigated .\nIt \u2019 s more likely that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The DOJ and FBI have been known to abuse the FOIA law enforcement exemption to hide investigative materials from public release .\nWe \u2019 ve seen them do it .\nAnd they \u2019 re doing it again .\nBut here \u2019 s the good news : the FBI \u2019 s response is a tacit admission that these records exist .\nWe \u2019 ll fight for them .\nAnd we \u2019 ll get

slavery which happened 200 or 400 years ago , the epidemic of modern slavery continues to go relatively unnoticed .\nAccording to the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 ( TVPA ) , slavery is defined as , \u201c The recruitment , harboring , transportation , provision , or obtaining of a person for labor or services , through the use of force , fraud or coercion for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude , peonage , debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : these are real slaves by anyone \u2019 s definition \u2013 trapped in factories , mines , brothels , farming fields , restaurants , and in private homes as domestic servants .\nMore than half of those affected are women and children .\nIn 2022 , the global numbers have reached record levels\u2026 A new report from the United Nations found that approximately fifty million people around the world are trapped in forced labor or forced marriage .\nThe report , entitled \u201c Global Estimates of Modern Slavery , \u201d was published by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Migration \u2014 two U.N. agencies \u2014 as well as the international human rights group Walk Free .\n\u201c It is shocking that the situation of modern slavery is not

organizations say the number of people in such dire situations has jumped 25 % from the previous report five years ago .\nThe issue is not limited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all forced labor and a quarter of all forced marriages occur in upper-middle-income or high-income countries .\nLast year , according to the report , an estimated 22 million people were living in forced marriage , a 6.6 million increase over 2016 global estimates .\nThe U.N. notes that the true number is likely far greater , particularly among marriages involving children ages 16 and younger , because estimates are based on a narrow definition of forced marriage that excludes some child marriages .\nThe report also cites concerns about compulsory prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States and discussed possible forced labor of Muslim minorities in parts of China .\nChildren account for one out of five people in forced labor , with more than half of them stuck in commercial sexual exploitation , the report said .\nThe report also found that migrant workers are over three times more likely to be in forced labor than other adult workers .\n\u201c This report underscores the urgency of ensuring that all migration is safe ,

stock trading should work .\nThe basics : All members of Congress , their spouses , and dependents under 18 would be barred \u201c from owning or trading securities , commodities , futures , derivatives , options , or other similar financial assets.\n\u201d They would have to divest the \u201c prohibited investments within 120 days of the effective date \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in \u201c a Qualified Blind Trust \u201d or \u201c widely held , diversified mutual or exchange-traded funds , or U.S. Treasury bills.\n\u201d The signatories crossed partisan and ideological lines , reflecting the philosophical diversity of advocates for the trading ban .\nWithin the Democratic majority , supporters of the idea include such staunch progressives as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Katie Porter of California as well as moderates such as Abigail Spanberger of Virginia and Jared Golden of Maine .\nThe top two names on the letter were those of Reps. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fitzpatrick ( R-Pa. ) .\nIn interviews , supporters of the idea made the essential point : That in their routine work , members of Congress run across all sorts of information \u2014 from intelligence , government

Danchenko \u2019 s false statements , expected testimony from Clinton-connected executive Charles Dolan , and one crazy development .\nBut we \u2019 ll start with the most damning development : Danchenko was on the FBI payroll as a confidential human source ( CHS ) from March 2017 through October 2020 .\nThe purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite clear .\nThe Crossfire Hurricane investigation was plagued with problems from the outset .\nThe reasons for opening the investigation were bunk .\nThose problems continued as the investigation went on , with claims of Trump/Russia collusion proven unverified or outright false .\n( Thus the targeting of Flynn for a Logan Act violation . )\nThat developed into the Carter Page FISA applications , first submitted to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ( FISC ) in October 2016 , and which relied substantially on the Steele Dossiers ( aka Steele Reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three times \u2013 more on that later .\nEach application had its own problems , from FBI lawyers lying about Carter Page to the Court being generally misled .\nRealizing its own misconduct , the FBI made Danchenko a paid CHS in March 2017 \u2013 just before the third FISA warrant was submitted in April 2017 .\nThis would allow Comey \u2019 s FBI to work directly with Danchenko in support of its counter-intelligence investigation against President Trump .\nDanchenko being a CHS also served another purpose : it protected the Bureau and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c sources and methods.\n\u201d How do you hide misconduct ?\nBury the witness .\nContext helps

2017 : The application for the second FISA warrant is submitted to the FISC .\n\u2022 January 24-25 , 2017 : Danchenko is first interviewed by the FBI .\nAt those meetings , he made false statements that he spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Millian agreed to meet him in New York .\nBoth those claims were false .\n\u2022 March 2017 : Danchenko is hired by the FBI as a CHS .\n\u2022 March 16 , 2017 : Danchenko lies to FBI agents that \u201c he received a late July 2016 telephone call from an individual who Danchenko believed was \u2018 probably \u2019 [ Millian \u201d ] , when in truth and in fact , and as

, 2017 : Danchenko lies to FBI agents that he had never \u201c spoken with PR Executive-1 \u201d ( Dolan ) about the dossier allegations .\n\u2022 June 29 , 2017 : The application for the fourth FISA

your own self-healing skills ; learn to acknowledge your body \u2019 s miraculous range of techniques for dealing with threats and diseases ; and learn to know when your body can look after itself \u2014 and when you need professional help .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2014 and this includes acupuncturists , osteopaths , aromatherapists and all other \u2018 alternative \u2019 practitioners , as well

.\nWhether he sticks needles into you , gives you herbal tea to drink or prescribes a drug for you to swallow the therapist has to do something to you , or give you something to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe evidence to show that this interventionist philosophy is wrong is incontrovertible .\nWhen you fall ill you do not necessarily need to have anything done to you .\nYour body is equipped with

threatening as cancer .\nYour internal appetite control centre can ensure that you eat only the foods that your body needs \u2014 and it can help make sure that you never become overweight .\nYour

mechanisms will be overwhelmed and will need support .\nBut to dismiss these mechanisms on the grounds that they don \u2019 t provide a complete answer to all health problems is like arguing that it isn \u2019 t worthwhile learning to swim because occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifeguard .\nI firmly believe that if you learn to use the power of your own body you will benefit in a number of ways .\nFirst , of course , you will reduce the risk of being injured by a healthcare professional .\nEvery year thousands of people suffer because of unnecessary treatments used by orthodox and alternative practitioners .\nSecond , you will benefit because when an interventionist treats an illness he usually tries to oppose your body \u2019 s own internal responses , as well as whatever outside agent may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place .\nThis isn \u2019 t necessarily a good idea .\nAll symptoms are merely signs that a fight is taking place inside your body .\nUnless the interventionist treatment is carefully designed to support and aid your body , the treatment applied may well end up damaging and even weakening your body \u2019 s internal mechanisms \u2014 eventually making you more vulnerable and more reliant on interventionists and their treatments .\nIt is vitally important that you learn to use your body \u2019 s powers and learn to recognise precisely when you @ @ @ @ @

mRNA booster vaccines for COVID .\nThe next day , September 1 , the CDC \u2019 s advisory committee and CDC Director approved the immediate rollout of the new vaccines .\nThey will be administered in the US starting this week .\nSurprisingly , more than a month before either agency had given its okay to the entirely new formulation , the federal government ordered 105 million doses from Pfizer and 66 million doses from Moderna .\nThe desired composition of the vaccine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after its advisory committee had met on June 24 , 2022 .\nThe vaccines contain a mix of the old , original Wuhan strain vaccine mRNA ( now also referred to as the ancestral vaccine ) and a new omicron BA.4/5 mRNA coding for the omicron spike protein .\nThe total amount of mRNA for the Pfizer and Moderna booster vaccines is the same as before : 30 mcg for Pfizer and 50 mcg for Moderna .\nEach is composed of 50 % omicron mRNA and 50 % ancestral mRNA , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vials and their boxes do not list the dose , hinting that the decision regarding how much to use was made very recently .\nEven the members of the CDC \u2019 s advisory committee did not know the dosage of the new bivalent vaccines until their September 1 meeting .\nThis is the fastest rollout of a new vaccine in world history .\nHow did it happen ?\nInstead of this being a tale of human grit and ingenuity , it is a tale of human weakness and recklessness .\nLet me ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine rollout occur ?\nIt occurred the only way it could possibly occur : by bending the rules , creating a new regulatory playbook and failing to obtain any human data for the new vaccines .\nThe manufacturers did not have to go through months-long trials , and FDA did not have to pore over any human trial data , because there weren \u2019 t any .\nLet that sink in : the new BA.4/5 bivalent vaccines have only been tested in mice , not humans .\nHere is an amazing fact : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave its approval to start the vaccine program , September 1 , health agencies in Canada , Switzerland and the European Union \u2019 s FDA ( the European Medicines Association ) also rolled out new , bivalent booster shot programs .\nAlmost simultaneously , the UK authorized 2 different bivalent boosters on August 15 and September 3 .\nThe UK has told people to expect the largest rollout in history for the new bivalent boosters .\nAnd it has started the program by promising large bonuses to doctors if they manage to vaccinate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by October 23 .\nThese other countries are using an earlier omicron mRNA as the template for their omicron-ancestral bivalent vaccines , while the US is using the mRNA code for the later omicron variant BA.4/5 spike .\nHow Can You Get Complete Information on These Boosters ?\nHow are the mainstream media telling this story ?\nWith their usual spin , avoiding the sticky parts .\nInstead of helping you understand what just happened , the New York Times asks , \u201c When should you get yours ?\n\u201d Not should you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it .\nThe Herald Tribune tells you why you should get it .\nSTAT News says it answers your questions , but it never asks the relevant questions about why such a rapid , unprecedented rollout occurred \u2014 especially when we are at practically historic lows for deaths and ICU stays due to COVID .\nThe Associated Press did slightly better , at least posing the question of whether you should get a new booster .\nBut then its answers don \u2019 t dig any deeper than its fellow media outlets .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ be getting the information you need to understand the boosters and the process by which they were ushered in from the major media .\nSo the Defender has reviewed FDA documents , attended the all day CDC advisory committee meeting on September 1 , studied a review of the boosters published in the New England Journal of Medicine on August 31 , and evaluated a study of omicron boosters that were tested in non-human primates by Dr. Fauci \u2019 s Vaccine Research Center .\nWe will provide you real science .\nWhat Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the New Boosters ?\nFDA did not convene its advisory committee before issuing the authorizations , and it is not hard to guess why .\nLast year , its advisors voted against authorizing the ancestral boosters , because the data they were given indicated the old vaccines were continuing to work well .\nTwo top officials at FDA who disagreed with the 2021 booster rollout resigned , hinting that the decision to issue boosters had been imposed on the FDA .\nThis year , FDA \u2019 s VRBPAC ( Vaccine and Related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been complaining about being given less and less data as they are asked to sign off on vaccine programs for younger and younger ages .\nVRBPAC member Dr. Paul Offit , a professor of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Pennsylvania and coinventor of a Rotavirus vaccine said last month that \u201c the fix was in , \u201d implying that the committee \u2019 s deliberations were a sham , because the White House announced it was purchasing the vaccine right after the meeting ended .\nDr. Offit was quoted last week as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to roll out the new boosters .\nSo FDA chose not to give him and the other members a public venue where they would predictably complain about FDA \u2019 s laxity \u2014 what some might call recklessness , insubordination or even gross malfeasance .\nAfter all , according to the FDA \u2019 s mission statement , FDA \u201c is responsible for protecting the public health by ensuring the safety , efficacy , and security of human and veterinary drugs , biological products , and medical devices.\n\u201d Not rubberstamping untested vaccines .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was probably intended to confuse the public .\nHere are several examples .\n1.Everyone knows the term \u201c safe and effective , \u201d which is an official FDA stamp of approval for licensed drugs and vaccines .\nHowever , by law the term can not be used by FDA to refer to unlicensed , experimental products , which is what all emergency use authorized drugs and vaccines are .\nSo FDA tried to hint at the desired terminology without using it .\nIn its press release on the new boosters , FDA used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quoting Dr. Peter Marks , the director of FDA \u2019 s vaccine center : \u201c We have worked closely with the vaccine manufacturers to ensure the development of these updated boosters was done safely and efficiently.\n\u201d 2.Dr .\nMarks also said , \u201c The public can be assured that a great deal of care has been taken by the FDA to ensure that these bivalent COVID-19 vaccines meet our rigorous safety , effectiveness and manufacturing quality standards for emergency use authorization.\n\u201d Again , \u2018 safe and effective \u2019 is implied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marks expects the public to miss is the fact that there are no quality standards for emergency use authorizations ( EUAs ) .\nThe statute authorizing EUAs simply requires that the known and expected benefits outweigh the known and expected risks of the product .\nThere are no quality requirements at all , and FDA is not even required to inspect the factories where EUA products are manufactured , as it must do for licensed products .\nNor is it required to inspect the final product .\nSo the FDA is fooling us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFurthermore , Dr. Marks and the FDA know that all EUA products have been granted an extremely broad waiver of liability that covers Dr. Marks , the FDA , CDC , HHS , the manufacturers , distributors , doctors , pharmacists , and everyone involved in the vaccine program .\nSo they can tell us anything , because the public has no recourse to the courts to bring suit when an EUA product is involved .\n4.FDA justifies its assessment that the untested vaccines are safe using the following argument : \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine ( original and omicron BA.1 ) and with the monovalent Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine are relevant to the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine , Bivalent because these vaccines are manufactured using the same process.\n\u201d This is the same as claiming that almond butter is safe , so peanut butter is safe too because it is manufactured using the same process .\nIs that really the best excuse for failing to perform its regulatory functions that FDA can offer ?\nWhat Happened at the CDC ACIP ( Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ) Meeting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have a hard time convincing the public to take these vaccines , since almost everyone has already had COVID , the earlier vaccine benefits were overpromised , the disease has become milder , the vaccines do not prevent infection or transmission and the fearfulness around COVID is mostly gone .\nTherefore , CDC needed to employ new strategies .\nOne strategy was to invoke the \u2018 bandwagon effect.\n\u2019 You try to convince the public that everyone else is getting the shot , so they too should jump on the bandwagon .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting that claimed that 72 % of people that were eligible planned to get the new boosters .\nHow likely is that to be true ?\nOnly 33 % of the population has already gotten a first booster , while 65 % have said , \u2018 No thanks.\n\u2019 And the interest in COVID jabs is way down .\nUnder 5 % of preschoolers have received a COVID vaccine in the 3 months since they were authorized .\nCDC implied to the ACIP that 49 % of the public had been boosted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times say the actual number is 33 % .\nHere is how CDC performed the calculation to make it appear the boosters are more popular than they are : sixty-seven per cent of the public is \u2018 fully vaccinated \u2019 according to the CDC .\nForty-nine percent of those 67 % ( those who are fully vaccinated ) is 33 % .\nThe federal government allocated a billion dollars to buy advertising and guarantee positive news coverage ( and suppress bad news ) to push the earlier COVID vaccines .\nOne wonders how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new boosters .\nCDC says that 224 million Americans are \u2018 fully vaccinated.\n\u2019 The ACIP members were told that of this number , 210 million are already eligible for the new boosters .\nThe government has bought 171 million bivalent booster doses so far ( 105 million from Pfizer and 66 million from Moderna ) which can be used for those aged 12 and up .\nFDA and CDC have yet to allow the rollout of new bivalent boosters for children under twelve , who have in the past received lower dose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies said they plan to do so within weeks .\nAnother testy issue for the ACIP committee was the question of how long these boosters will work , and how frequently they will be recommended .\nThe ACIP members are responsible for giving advice on all vaccines , and they don \u2019 t want the COVID vaccines to sour the public on other vaccines .\nAlthough a recommendation to give the bivalent boosters 4 months after an earlier dose had once been floated , the ACIP committee was asked to approve the boosters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since a prior dose .\nCDC \u2019 s Dr. Twentyman said that CDC is no longer counting the total number of doses .\nShe said that even if a person has received 4 or 5 prior COVID vaccinations , a new bivalent booster \u201c should not be denied , \u201d as long as 2 months have passed since the last dose .\nHow Long Will It Work ?\nAccording to this week \u2019 s NEJM article , Four weeks !\nAntibody titers sink 4 weeks after the 4th dose .\nNo wonder CDC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such frequent boosters .\nThe COVID vaccinators have coined a new term , hybrid immunity , riffing off hybrid electric cars .\nIt refers to the improved immunity a vaccinated person has if they also got the disease !\nAs if being vaccinated but getting the disease anyway is to be normalized as desirable .\nAfter CDC spent two years denying that natural immunity \u2014 the kind people get after infection \u2014 even exists , CDC is now trying to take a lemon vaccine , add natural immunity , call it hybrid immunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rollout Justified ?\nOmicron variants have been present since last November , and it was soon discovered that both vaccine-induced and natural immunity due to earlier variants were very limited for omicron variants , because they are so different from the ancestral strain .\nThe health agencies and manufacturers have been testing omicron vaccine prototypes for up to 9 months .\nMost of those tests involved BA.1 and BA.2 omicron strains .\nHowever , 90 % of current cases are caused by omicron BA.5 , which is genetically far from BA.1 and BA.2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( involving a few hundred subjects each ) for several of the earlier omicron vaccine prototypes , so the health agencies decided to simply pretend that mRNA designed for BA.1 and BA.2 was close enough to BA.5 that the data were comparable .\nSince 50 % of the vaccine contents would be the old vaccine , FDA claimed it had already established the safety and efficacy of that half .\nThen , to round things out , there were data from mice , which generated comparable antibody levels to the new vaccines as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , we can rely on mice to behave exactly like people , right ?\nAfter all , they have been \u2018 humanized \u2019 to contain a human ACE-2 receptor .\nNo , we can not rely on mice .\nWe can not even rely on nonhuman primates as a model for vaccines , as every species reacts uniquely and unpredictably to infections and to vaccinations .\nBut mice data do bulk up FDA \u2019 s authorization \u2018 package \u2019 so it looks like FDA did a more thorough review .\nHaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , One Needs to Ask How Well It Might Work Predictions from Nature magazine and Dr. Fauci \u2019 s NIAID Vaccine Research Center ( VRC ) at the NIH are that the new vaccines will not improve on the old vaccines .\nAccording to the VRC , \u201c a study in nonhuman primates showed that an omicron specific messenger RNA vaccine was not better than the original messenger RNA-1273 [ ancestral Moderna ] vaccine for protection against omicron challenge.\n\u201d Nature notes , \u201c an analysis [ posted August 26 ] suggests that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same protection as an extra dose of the older vaccines \u2014 particularly when it comes to keeping people out of hospital.\n\u201d Neither of these studies was discussed at the ACIP meeting .\nNo discussion was provided regarding why and how the bivalent vaccines were chosen .\nThe reason why the omicron vaccines won \u2019 t stimulate a good omicron response is attributed by the NIAID VRC authors to antigenic priming , also known as original antigenic sin .\nThis means that the immune system has been programmed to respond over and over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine it encountered , even when it encounters different coronavirus antigens later .\nHow well did the old vaccine work ?\nThe CDC slide below , presented by CDC \u2019 s Dr. Link-Gelles , is not well labeled , but it shows that whether you got two or three doses of the old vaccine , during the omicron period efficacy in all age groups was under 40 % at three months .\nBy six months it hovered around zero efficacy ( no benefit ) , and after that it was negative ( harmful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means that the vaccinated are more prone to being infected with COVID than the unvaccinated .\nThis is consistent with what we are seeing from the UK and some other countries : the vaccinated become more likely to get COVID .\nAnd it is this effect that the public health agencies are probably trying to stave off , or hide , with perpetual boosters .\nIt appears the public here and in many other countries is being misled to receive an untested ( or in other countries a BA .\n1 or 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise it will be so much better than the older vaccine .\nThe regulators know it is unlikely to be better , but their public relations engines are revved up to convince us otherwise .\nHow Safe Are the New Vaccines ?\nThat is anybody \u2019 s guess , because you can not assess human safety from animal models , since they don \u2019 t predict the human response .\nWhat was done to evaluate the safety of the bivalent vaccines ?\nReactogenicity is a word that refers to short term vaccine adverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatigue or muscle aches .\nAccording to the CDC briefers , the degree of reactogenicity from the omicron prototype vaccines was comparable to that from the older , \u2018 ancestral \u2019 COVID vaccines .\nThere were no data on more serious side effects , and Dr. Shimabukuro of CDC said there was no way to assess the risk of myocarditis due to the small number of subjects who received the prototype vaccines .\nHowever , if you look at Pfizer \u2019 s chart prepared for the ACIP members below , you will notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acute side effects ) seen after the omicron prototype vaccines than seen after the older vaccines .\nThis may be a signal that more severe reactions will result from the newer vaccines , but there is no way to be sure .\nPresenters to the ACIP claimed that myocarditis was less common after booster shots of the old vaccine than after the second dose of the initial series .\nHowever , slide 39 shown by Dr. Shimabukuro , which was quickly passed over , showed the opposite .\nFor 16-17 year-old boys and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the chance of myocarditis was increased after a booster .\n( See below . )\nSo there is no reason to think the boosters will be any safer than the second dose , in terms of myocarditis .\nThat risk , by the way , was about 1 in 2,000 young men aged 18-24 after their second dose in one Kaiser study .\nDr. Shimabukuro also said that if you get vaccinated soon after recovering from COVID , increased side effects , at least short-term , are to be expected \u2014 but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it places you at increased risk of myocarditis.\n\u201d I am not reassured by the lack of evidence .\nIn fact , pediatric cardiologist Dr. Kirk Milhoan last week reviewed all the evidence that Dr. Shimabukuro couldn \u2019 t find .\nGetting vaccinated soon after recovering from COVID is foolhardy , and any officials mandating the shots after recovery are putting those in their charge at even greater risk of adverse reactions , including myocarditis .\nSome scientists , including Dr. Barouch in last week \u2019 s NEJM , assert that myocarditis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a case of COVID than it is after vaccination .\nBut he cited not a single source for this claim .\nPediatric cardiologist Kirk Milhoan reviewed all the recent literature on the question of myocarditis rates after infection versus after vaccination .\nIt appears that the vaccine puts you at more risk of myocarditis than a COVID infection does , but there are many different factors that influence risk , including age , gender , whether you already had COVID and how recently , and the type of vaccines received .\nModerna vaccines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pfizer .\nReceiving a Moderna vaccine after an initial Pfizer vaccine raises the risk even more than getting 2 Moderna vaccines .\nSee Table 2 from an important study of myocarditis in 4 Nordic countries .\nFrance , Germany , Sweden , Norway , Finland , Denmark and Iceland have all halted Moderna COVID vaccinations for young males .\nAn ACIP member asked whether the Jynneos monkeypox vaccine , which can also induce myocarditis , could be given together with the new bivalent vaccines ?\nWould this increase the myocarditis risk ?\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefing book , \u201d which may have meant that this was not to be discussed in public .\nSpeaking of what could be discussed in public , any discussion of pregnancy and COVID vaccination was forbidden at the ACIP meeting .\nMultiple committee members asked for information on pregnancy , but the briefers steadfastly refused to provide any .\nNothing on hospitalizations , deaths , fetal outcomes .\nThe ACIP members were told they would be briefed on this at a future meeting .\nDr. Miller , representing Moderna , said they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 800 pregnant women in a study .\nWhich would someday be completed .\nThe only conclusion I can draw is that the CDC doesn \u2019 t like the results they have now .\nAnd they plan to delay providing them to the public for as long as possible .\nYet CDC established a pregnancy registry for the COVID vaccines nearly 18 months ago .\nCDC and FDA must have data on many thousands of pregnancies .\nEvery woman who receives a COVID vaccine dose must provide information on whether she is pregnant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CDC collects all this information .\nFurthermore , there are thousands of VAERS reports on adverse pregnancy outcomes .\nFDA required Pfizer/BioNTech to study the effect of the vaccine in pregnancy when it issued a license for Comirnaty on August 23 , 2021 .\nFDA also required additional vaccine safety studies in children and additional studies of myocarditis at the same time .\nThe problem is that these studies won \u2019 t be completed for up to five years , long after billions of doses have been given and the vaccines will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to justify why FDA would ask for these studies to take so long .\nWas FDA requesting such long study durations in order to delay its vaccine safety assessment until after the vaccines are no longer in use ?\nThe only conclusion I can draw is that FDA and CDC don \u2019 t like the safety results they already have .\nAnd they plan to withhold the bad news for as long as possible .\nThe committee was also interested in long COVID .\nMight the vaccines prevent this dread complication ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed that CDC does not have \u201c systematic data \u201d on long COVID .\nNor has CDC developed a case definition for long COVID .\nWhy has CDC delayed investigating this critically important complication ?\nThe NY Times revealed in February 2022 that CDC conceals the bulk of the public health data it collects .\nAccording to the Times , \u201c Much of the withheld information could help state and local health officials better target their efforts to bring the virus under control.\n\u201d You are not going to find a more public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Centers for Disease Control than that .\nDoes vaccination fail to prevent long covid ?\nDoes it cause long covid ?\nFLCCC founder and esteemed intensive care physician Dr. Paul Marik has postulated that both long COVID and many COVID vaccine injuries are due to the same thing : the prolonged presence of spike proteins in the circulation .\nIf true , there may be considerable overlap between the symptoms and pathology of long COVID and vaccine injuries , and CDC may be trying to conceal this , or perhaps be seeking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injuries are due to COVID .\nFDA Revoked All Pfizer and Moderna Emergency Use Authorizations for the Old Boosters on August 31 This was sudden and unexpected .\nAppointments had to be cancelled , because starting on August 31 the old vaccines were limited to use in only young children or for the initial series .\nThe FDA did not withdraw or recall the licensed Comirnaty and Spikevax vaccines , which have also been approved as a booster dose .\nIs this a tacit acknowledgement that there is no licensed Comirnaty or Spikevax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FDA have rolled out the new vaccines so quickly to justify removing most of the old vaccines from use , soon after reports began circulating about their contents containing undisclosed and possibly harmful materials ?\n\u2022 The FDA and CDC have cooperated to issue emergency use authorizations and rollout new , bivalent Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines this week , without any human trials , which is unprecedented .\n\u2022 These vaccines continue to enjoy extraordinary protection from liability , while the recipient has no access to the legal system in the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence that the new vaccines are safe , while there is limited evidence that they may be more harmful than earlier COVID vaccines \u2014 but in the absence of human testing , there is no way to truly predict their safety .\nSafety data are being concealed by the federal health agencies .\nMessaging by them is misleading .\n\u2022 There is no evidence the new bivalent vaccines will be more effective than the older vaccines , and existing evidence suggests that any efficacy they provide will persist no longer than 1 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to increase susceptibility to COVID infections , on average starting 6 months after an inoculation .\n\u2022 Perpetual boosters briefly stave off the negative efficacy that develops a few months after a COVID vaccination .\nThis may be why frequent boosters are being pushed .\nBut frequent boosters may also weaken overall immunity and may even contribute to rising mortality rates in the US and UK .\n\u2022 There is international coordination regarding bivalent boosters , and a major effort will be undertaken to get them into arms , despite historically low levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this video presentation with Dr. Meryl Nass for Children \u2019 s Health Defense TV : This article was originally

Igor Danchenko , the primary source of the notorious and utterly discredited \u201c Trump-Russia| \u201d dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele , have filed a motion to dismiss the charges brought against their client by special counsel John Durham .\nIn the process , they have revealed another startling and potentially criminal dimension to the FBI \u2019 s probe of potential collusion between the campaign of former President Donald Trump and the Kremlin .\nDurham charged Danchenko in November 2021 with five counts of lying to the bureau .\nFour of those relate to statements he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he repeatedly claimed to have met and had conversations with Sergey Millian , a Belarusian-born businessman who claimed ties with the Trump campaign .\nDanchenko , and thus Steele , claimed Millian was a key source of the dossier \u2019 s most explosive allegations \u2013 namely , that there was a \u201c well-developed conspiracy of cooperation \u201d between Trump and the Kremlin , that Russia \u2019 s GRU had hacked the Democratic National Convention email server and provided the content for WikiLeaks for the purposes of \u201c plausible deniability , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c golden shower \u201d from prostitutes while in Moscow years earlier , which was filmed by Russian intelligence and could be used as \u201c kompromat.\n\u201d In his FBI interview , conducted between February 9 and 12 , 2017 , Danchenko claimed to have received this incendiary intelligence through telephone conversations and email exchanges with Millian , who also suggested they discuss matters further in person in New York City .\nHowever , Durham charges that Danchenko fabricated these calls , repeatedly emailed Millian without response , and was never invited to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows that to buttress these claims , Danchenko provided the Bureau with a synopsis of a mid-August email he sent to Millian , a month prior to his sit-down interview series .\nYet , as the filing notes , the communication makes no mention of the phonecalls they \u2019 d purportedly engaged in previously , or the prospect of meeting in person .\nScapegoat : Danchenko is expected to take the fall after helping British intelligence operative Christopher Steele create the fake dossier on Trump , laundered through the FBI .\nDanchenko \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact proves he wasn \u2019 t lying about having had direct contact with Millian , and made clear they \u2019 d never spoken to his interviewers .\nProblematically for all involved , though , Danchenko , and as a result Steele , both attributed wild charges against the Trump campaign to Millian before this email .\nIn turn too , this means the FBI had concrete reasons to believe at least some of the Steele dossier was bogus on January 25 , 2017 at the very latest .\nBut the Bureau , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assess \u201d the dossier \u2019 s veracity , but to use it as a justification for further surveillance of Trump 2016 presidential campaign adviser Carter Page , and intensifying its investigation of the campaign .\nThe FBI \u2019 s questionable use of the dossier in court submissions to secure FISA warrants against Page is well-known , and was a key criticism of a December 2019 Justice Department Inspector General review , which determined the Bureau made 17 errors or omissions in its FISA applications .\nEven more damningly though , just two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the FBI , Trump privately met with then-FBI director James Comey , and the President specifically raised the Steele dossier .\nAccording to Comey \u2019 s account of the dinner , as retold in the Mueller report : \u201c the President\u2026stated that he was thinking about ordering the FBI to investigate the [ Steele ] allegations to prove they were false .\nComey responded that the President should think carefully about issuing such an order because it could create a narrative that the FBI was investigating him personally , which was incorrect.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , appealing to his ego and feigning concern for his reputation , when he knew better than anyone bar Steele and Danchenko themselves that the FBI was already investigating the former MI6 operative \u2019 s \u201c allegations \u201d and knew them to be meritless .\nHad he told the truth , perhaps the entire Russiagate fraud would \u2019 ve collapsed before it had even properly erupted publicly .\nIf he \u2019 d known , the President may not have been successfully pressured into demonstrating his anti-Russian credentials with an increasingly hostile and belligerent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to dangerous lengths the previous administration had deliberately avoided , such as arming and legitimizing the Neo-Nazi Azov Battalion , and shredding vital Cold War arms control treaties , brinksmanship that brought us to where we are today .\nIn any event , while the filing is in many ways useful confirmation of top-level FBI knowledge of the dossier \u2019 s inherent worthlessness at an early stage , it could pose problems for Danchenko \u2019 s prosecution .\nHis conviction hangs on the ability of Durham \u2019 s team to prove his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation , and it can be easily argued that the Bureau \u2019 s evident determination to investigate Trump \u2019 s non-existent Russia ties meant no disclosure , true or false , would \u2019 ve convinced the agency to stop .\nThat the FBI was utterly determined irrespective of facts to damage Trump , first as a candidate , then as leader , has long-been clear , yet it has largely faded from public memory .\nOne might argue it \u2019 s quite incredible that even the former president \u2019 s supporters have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Bureau \u2019 s raid on Mar-a-Lago , which bears clear hallmarks of being likewise politically motivated .\nEvidence of the FBI \u2019 s anti-Trump agenda is amply available in black and white \u2013 so too the agency \u2019 s surging Russophobia .\nTwo of the key Bureau figures central to the Trump-Russia probe , one-time lovers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page , spelled this out both in public testimony and private text messages .\nOn the latter front , Strzok texted Page in July 2016 \u2013 right when the Trump-Russia probe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ f*** the cheating motherf***ing Russians\u2026bastards\u2026I hate them\u2026I think they \u2019 re probably the worst .\nF***ing conniving cheating savages.\n\u201d He also pledged that the pair would together \u201c stop \u201d Trump from winning .\nPage was only slightly less foul-mouthed when she testified to Congress in July 2018 : \u201c It is my opinion that with respect to Western ideals and who it is and what it is we stand for as Americans , Russia poses the most dangerous threat to that way of life.\n\u201d Quite why Strzok and Page , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haven \u2019 t been prosecuted for their role in arguably the biggest US national security scam since the Iraq

Balakleya , Izium , Kupiansk , Volchansk and a number of villages and small locales .\nNevertheless , the Russian army , by concentrating on rearguard battles , was able to avoid significant losses

no exact information about the population of this region .\nThe last census was conducted by Kiev more than 20 years ago , and the country \u2019 s statistics are known to be wildly inaccurate .\nAt the outset , we can estimate the pre-war population at 200,000 people .\nAfter the outbreak of hostilities , some were forced to flee .\nThe number of refugees depended on the intensity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia-border town of Volchansk , people continued to live normally \u2013 they had not heard firing in the city since March \u2013 and there has always been humanitarian aid .\nHowever , the frontline villages south of Izium were virtually wiped off the face of the earth .\nIn any case , we are talking about tens of thousands of people .\nMost likely , at least 100,000 people lived in the Russian-controlled territories .\nSome of them remain under the protection of the Russian army , which controls the left bank of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kupiansk-Uzlovoi and Borovaya , which have now become the sites of intense hostilities .\nAfter the beginning of the Ukrainian offensive , some Kharkov Region residents were forced to leave their homes .\nAn evacuation was carried out in Volchansk , Veliky Burluk , Kupiansk and Izium .\nVarious estimates suggest that between 5,000 and 25,000 people have fled to Russia in September alone .\nFILE PHOTO : Residents of Mariupol in the basement of a house

particular to the nearest district center of Svatovo .\nIn any case , most local residents have remained in situ .\nBased on the communication with residents of small Donbass front-line towns that have been shelled for eight years , it is safe to say that such a decision is not politically motivated .\nResidents of such areas , many of whom are older people , those with disabilities , families with household plots or low-mobility relatives who require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , homes and traditional way of life to the end .\nThey are the ones who have not evacuated their homes in recent months , and it is they who are now under threat .\nA number of channels have appeared in the Telegram messenger app , one of the leading social media platforms for both sides of the conflict , which publish the personal data of so-called \u201c collaborators.\n\u201d The basis for accusations could be anything , including communicating with the Russian military or receiving humanitarian aid .\nSome of these

waiters.\n\u201d According to the public consensus in Ukraine , such people who sympathize with Moscow are the cause of the conflict .\nIn the eyes of Ukrainian radicals , anyone who expresses a positive attitude towards Russia is a threat to national security .\nThus , personal data in the early days of the offensive was published for one purpose : to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be killed during the

and with the functions of judge , prosecutor and executioner performed by Ukrainian combatants .\nTo help their murderous cause , similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data with calls for lynching .\nAfter the \u2018 cleansing \u2019 is completed , elements of the Ukrainian legal system will come to the captured cities .\nThey will focus on the concealment of war crimes committed during the \u201c clean-up , \u201d and instead point the finger at Russia .\nThe last two tasks will be carried out simultaneously , such as in Bucha , and those killed by Ukrainians will be cynically presented as victims of the Russian army .\nAccording to the Security Service of Ukraine ( SBU ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of collaborating with Russian authorities had already been detained .\nThe security agents are first and foremost interested in tax officials responsible for the functioning of local businesses during Moscow \u2019 s control of the territory .\nHowever , local teachers who switched to teaching the Russian curriculum are also at risk .\nDespite international humanitarian law , which obliges the party in control of a territory to preserve the educational process and emphasizes that no harm be done to educators , Kiev seems determined to punish teachers , to use them as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister of Ukraine Irina Vereshchuk says that these teachers committed crimes and should be punished for high treason .\nSuch measures by the Ukrainian government are aimed primarily at intimidating educators in Russian-controlled territory .\nBy showing a willingness to prosecute civilian workers , Kiev is raising the stakes .\nUkrainian law enforcement is also known to detain forestry workers , for having helped the Russian army to collect firewood .\nThe details are unknown : whether they supplied the Russians with firewood on a commercial basis , felled the forests entrusted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where to chop , remains unknown .\nAny civilian living in Russian-controlled territory could be charged with collaboration .\nUkraine has a special ministry for the reintegration of \u201c temporarily occupied territories , \u201d which since 2016 has been developing a policy of \u201c filtering \u201d the civilian population .\nInitially , its activity was concentrated around Donbass and Crimea but its scope has now expanded .\nThe most striking example is the law \u2018 On the State Policy of the Transitional Period \u2019 , which has been criticized by , among others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law ] for the fact that Ukrainian state policy in the territories it occupies is aimed at investigating only the alleged war crimes of the opposite side , ignoring the goal of establishing the truth about all crimes .\nThis law also introduced differentiated treatment of citizens , depending on their level of interaction with Russia and/or the Donbass republics .\nThe topic of differentiating guilt \u2013 and , according to Ukraine , the entire civilian population is guilty to a greater or lesser degree \u2013 was then promoted by all sorts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Resource Center engaged with the Soros Foundation \u2019 s \u2018 Vozrozhdeniye \u2019 and the extremist organization \u2018 Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar people , \u2019 who claim to be the exiled Ukrainian government of Crimea , developed a whole methodology for evaluating the degree of collaboration .\nFor a demonstration of this scale , Ukrainians cited three respective examples : a doctor at a Crimean city hospital , an acting city council deputy and the ex-chief prosecutor of Crimea , Natalya Poklonskaya .\nAccording to the methodology , the doctor scores 17 points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 86 .\nThus , any Crimean doctor is already guilty of collaborationism , having 17 points .\nSince 2014 , Ukrainian society , represented by non-profit organizations , has debated the doctor \u2019 s degree of guilt and the punishment which ought be meted out .\nWe see the results of such discussions in Kharkov Region .\nIn addition to fighting teachers and foresters , Ukrainian law enforcement and the media are also busy falsifying war crimes .\nThey open the so-called \u201c cellars \u201d \u2013 illegal prisons and torture chambers , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were kept .\nThe process of falsification relies on vivid shots \u2013 frames with a prayer scratched on the wall of one of the basements .\nAnother fabrication involved seven Sri Lankan students attending the Kupiansky Medical College , which was allegedly held by Russian military personnel since March , who testified about torture by the Russians .\nThe official position is simple : angry Russians simply detained and tortured foreigners .\nThat the Russian army in fact evacuated them from Mariupol and Kherson is ignored .\nFor the time being , Sri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is asking Kiev to provide more information about its citizens .\nA fair investigation , however , should not be expected until those Sri Lankans find themselves outside the hands of the Ukrainian state .\nSpeaking of Kiev \u2019 s hand , another media symbol of the \u201c genocide of the Ukrainian people \u201d was presented as hand of the deceased with rubber bracelets in the colors of the Ukrainian flag .\nApparent evidence of a hate crime : a man killed for wearing Ukrainian symbols .\nAs it turned out , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a member of the 93rd Mechanized Brigade , who was killed during fighting near Izium .\nIn general , the only mass graves that Ukrainian propaganda now clings to are the cemeteries organized by Russians , where the victims of the military conflict were buried , including Ukrainian soldiers .\nThere is an inscription on one of the crosses , in particular , \u201c APU [ Ukrainian Armed Forces ] 17 people , Izium , from the morgue.\n\u201d Ukrainians claim that there are 440 bodies there .\nSome of the crosses have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number .\nThe bodies were buried by the Russian army in accordance with the traditions of the region .\nPerhaps , of course , among those buried under the cross are Muslims , Jews , or adherents to pagan beliefs popular among Ukrainian neo-Nazi battalions , but the Russians did everything possible on their part to ensure the remains of the enemy were not desecrated .\nIn normal circumstances , these bodies would have been given to the Ukrainian side in return for the bodies of dead Russian soldiers , but Ukraine boycotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit significant losses .\nIn particular , the son of the aforementioned Sergey Sova learned a few months later about the fate of his father and through the media requested the body be transferred back home for a proper burial .\nPrior to that , Sova had most likely been listed as missing , a ploy that suppresses official numbers of dead Ukrainian soldiers and avoids compensation payments to their families .\nNow , however , the Ukrainian soldiers killed in battle and buried in accordance with the dominant religious traditions in Ukraine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c alleged genocide.\n\u201d After a while , when it is impossible to distinguish whether people were killed in early September or mid-September , they will be presented as victims of the retreating Russian army .\nAll of this is a sinister and cynical story , the truth of which we can learn only after the return of the Russian army to Kharkov .\nOnly then will the massive machine of lies , propaganda and disinformation , which is the work of the Ukrainian government in the occupied territories , be broken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn about the real war criminals .\nAs when we discovered after the liberation

"content": "It \u2019 s one of the most disturbing trends in North America and Europe today : radical and deranged school facilitators and staff pushing innocent children into getting dangerous , life-altering medical procedures .\nEarlier this year , Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton acted on behalf of concerned residents and concluded that performing certain \u201c sex-change \u201d procedures on children , and prescribing puberty-blockers to them , would now be considered \u201c child abuse \u201d under Texas law .\nAG Paxton concluded that certain procedures done on minors such as castration , fabrication of a \u201c penis \u201d using tissue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a \u201c vagina \u201d involving the removal of male sex organs , prescription of puberty-suppressors and infertility-inducers \u2013 should be considered \u201c abuse \u201d under section 261.001 of the Texas Family Code .\nDespite all this , radical left-wing civil liberties lawyers have managed to convince a judge to halt any state investigations into this systemic practice of child abuse in the state .\nHowever , a new and comprehensive report has surfaced this week which has already dealt a major blow to this industrial-scale abuse\u2026 Although Democrat Circuit Judge Diana Motz intimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gender dysphoria are disabled , a recent scientific study revealed that real and irreversible disabilities are in fact caused by those puberty-blocking hormone injections introduced to minors under the guise of remedies .\nA study published on September 19 in the Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy explained that puberty blockers , also known as luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists or GnRHa drugs , are not just creating sexless adults , although GnRHa is a drug \u201c licensed to chemically castrate men.\n\u201d They are : depleting victims \u2019 bone density ; hampering their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deleterious emotional effects .\nDr. Michael Biggs , a professor of sociology at the University of Oxford , published his findings in an article entitled , \u201c The Dutch Protocol for Juvenile Transsexuals : Origins and Evidence.\n\u201d In the article , Biggs critically reviewed the fallout and ramifications of the internationally embraced Dutch protocol .\nThe Dutch protocol was a hormone intervention practice developed by clinicians at Utrecht and Amsterdam in the mid-1990s .\nIn the early days , cross-sex hormones were not introduced until a victim was between the ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutilation was not performed until the victim was 18 .\nHowever , Peggy Cohen-Kettenis advocated for patients to begin undergoing so-called treatment prior to adulthood .\nAccording to Biggs , boys were given anti-androgen and cyproterone acetate , which prevented erections and caused breasts to grow .\nGirls , conversely , were given progestin to stop menstruation and then testosterone , before being subjected to mastectomies , hysterectomies , and oophorectomies .\nWith the endocrinologist Henriette Delemarre-van de Waal and psychiatrist Louis Gooren , Cohen-Kettenis continued to develop and then codify her protocol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the treatment of adolescents misdiagnosed with gender dysphoria .\nFor years it was argued , including in the Journal of Homosexuality , that \u201c withholding physical medical interventions \u201d in the cases of adolescents exhibiting signs of so-called gender dysphoria were \u201c more harmful to wellbeing in both adolescence and adulthood when compared to cases where physical medical interventions were provided.\n\u201d According to Biggs , clinicians and activists came to regard natal puberty as \u201c a kind of disease , \u201d concluding that \u201c hormones of either sex can be treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proponents of the protocol suggested that GnRHa was \u201c fully reversible ; in other words , no lasting effects are to be expected.\n\u201d This disproven claim was advanced , said Biggs , to \u201c avoid the question of whether a child aged 12 ( or below ) could give consent to this endocrinological experiment.\n\u201d Among the irreversible side effects of the puberty blockers was a halting of critical bodily growth , including that of genitals .\nUpon the introduction of GnRHa to men , the penis would cease to grow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment .\nAdditionally , Biggs pointed out that advocates for transsexual alterations and puberty blockers misled the public about the likelihood that victims might just get over their adolescent confusion .\nHe suggested that a number of children sterilized and transmogrified would otherwise have turned out to be sexually functional gays or lesbians .\n\u201c Clinicians need to explain how they are sure that some of the adolescents being prescribed GnRHa would not have grown into gay or lesbian adults , with their sexuality and fertility intact.\n\u201d Cohen-Kettenis and her cadre of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decrease in depressive symptoms and their behavioral problems resolved \u201c while general functioning improved \u201d post-treatment .\nHowever , Biggs suggested the evidence provided was dubious and had also excluded results of eight patients , one of whom died of necrotizing fasciitis during vaginoplasty .\nBiggs remarked a \u201c fatality rate exceeding 1 % would surely halt any other experimental treatment on healthy teenagers.\n\u201d The irreplicability of the Dutch team \u2019 s results also cast into question the legitimacy of their claims .\nIn his examination of the international adoption of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once niche practice had been grossly overpopularized as the result of positive media coverage .\n\u201c Positive media coverage is known to increase referrals to gender clinics.\n\u201d For instance , Oprah Winfrey \u2019 s network broadcast the documentary \u201c I Am Jazz : A Family in Transition \u201d in 2011 , detailing how a young boy , Jared Jennings , was placed under puberty suppression at the age of 11 , not long after his mother said that \u201c you have to kinda nip puberty in the bud.\n\u201d After the show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of clinics for \u201c gender-nonconforming children and adolescence , \u201d 32 of which soon advised puberty blockers .\nJennings , who later complained to Oprah that boys didn \u2019 t like him , now \u201c has no libido and can not orgasm.\n\u201d The surgeon who mutilated Jennings , Marci Bowers , said \u201c every single child \u2026 who was truly blocked at Tanner stage 2 , has never experienced orgasm .\nI mean , it \u2019 s really about zero.\n\u201d Similar shows normalizing and promoting puberty blockers played to millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Body , \u201d which was broadcast in England .\nThis paper was released just weeks after the Nobel prize-winning sociologist Dr. Christiane N\u00fcsslein-Volhard , director emeritus at the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology , told Germany \u2019 s leading feminist magazine that \u201c taking hormones is inherently dangerous.\n\u201d N\u00fcsslein-Volhard stated that hormones \u201c add something to the body that is not intended there .\n\u2026 The body can not handle it in the long run.\n\u201d Those \u201c who want to change their gender \u2026 can \u2019 t do it .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ People retain their gender for life.\n\u201d No amount of medical alteration can change static biological realities .\nShe indicated further that expressions of femininity in men or masculinity in women are not indicative of blurred gender lines but rather of varying hormonal levels and cultural differences .\nGender dysphoria , in other words , maybe better addressed with time and understanding than with irreversible drugs and surgery .\nThe American College of Pediatricians reportedly indicated that GnRHa agonists \u201c arrest bone growth , decrease bone accretion , prevent the sex-steroid dependent organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inhibit fertility by preventing the development of gonadal tissue and mature gametes for the duration of treatment.\n\u201d According to the FDA , 6,379 people died between 2013 and June 2019 after taking the hormone blocker Lupron .\nThere were also 41,213 adverse events and 25,645 \u201c serious \u201d reactions reported .\nLupron is one of the drugs given to children diagnosed with gender dysphoria

will continue to spend money like children at a fair .\nThe UK Government plans to spend several hundred billion pounds on reckless energy subsidies while , at the same time , reducing taxes .\nThis is akin to a man giving up his job , buying a Rolls Royce and then driving to the South of France to buy a villa .\nPushing up expenditure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massive national debt , high interest rates , ruinous levels of taxation and hyperinflation .\nAnd massive levels of poverty \u2013 even among the middle classes .\nMortgage rates will rise and house prices will fall .\nBusinesses will go bust ( despite more government hand-outs ) and unemployment will rise ( it is already much higher than they say it is because students don \u2019 t count and nor do the million or two suffering from the imaginary disease known as \u2018 long covid \u2019 . )\nThe pound will slide further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American dollar .\nThis will push up the cost of imports ( such as oil and food ) and push inflation still higher .\n\u2022 There will be many floods .\nThese will be blamed on global warming .\nNo one will mention that houses have been built on flood plains and that rivers have been deliberately left blocked .\nRegular annual flooding is inevitable and is nothing to do with the mythical global warming .\n\u2022 There will , paradoxically , also be talk of droughts .\nNo new reservoirs have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have grown massively in the last few years .\nWater shortages are inevitable .\nIn Europe and the UK , populations have grown rapidly because of massive , encouraged , legal and illegal immigration .\n\u2022 Sewage systems will continue to be unable to cope .\nSewage systems were largely built in Victorian times \u2013back in the 19th century .\nOnce again , the sewage systems and drains have not been expanded to cope with the rise in populations .\nRaw sewage will be dumped regularly into rivers and the sea .\n\u2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far higher than usual in 2022-2023 \u2013 and far higher than it was in 2020 and 2021 .\nThe excess deaths will be blamed on covid and other infections though everyone with any brain tissue knows that the deaths are a result of the pointless and dangerous lockdowns , the failure of the NHS to operate effectively , the absence of a GP service and the deaths caused by the unnecessary and toxic covid-19 jabs .\nPoor eating habits ( resulting from poverty ) will lead to long-term illness and more deaths .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced ( and blamed for the deaths ) .\n\u2022 There will be many strikes .\nIf workers receive notable pay rises , these will increase still further the level of inflation .\nThis will increase levels of poverty among those who are not members of powerful trade unions .\nThe poor , the sick and the elderly will suffer most .\nThe soaring inflation will help create a depression which will last for decades .\nThis is just what the conspirators have ordered .\n\u2022 Christmas will not be celebrated in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This will be blamed on the energy crisis but in fact the conspirators have long planned to do away with Christmas as traditional religions are removed and replaced by ersatz religions such as Chrislam \u2013 a favourite of war criminal Tony Blair .\n\u2022 The war in Ukraine will continue to be a major cause of starvation and death around the world .\nI think it likely that this one designer war will lead to 500 million deaths in Asia and Africa alone .\nThe UK Government has promised to spend billions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will rise everywhere and the quality of goods and services will fall as companies struggle to stay in business .\n\u2022 Crime and violence will increase massively as millions struggle to cope with the massive rise in living costs .\n\u2022 Controls on cash will continue to grow .\nMore and more businesses will refuse to accept cash .\nBanks will close more ATM machines and will control the distribution and use of cash .\nThis has been planned for years .\n\u2022 Most electricity in Europe is produced with the aid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absurd \u2018 green \u2019 policies mean that the price of gas and oil are destined to continue to rise , the result must be a rise in electricity prices .\nThe absurd financial sanctions on Russia resulted in a reduction in supplies of oil and gas to the EU and the UK .\nUtility companies will go bust and will need government hand-outs ( adding still further to national debts ) .\nI didn \u2019 t say my predictions would make jolly reading .\nBut these are things which I believe will happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this is a result of incompetence and none of this is accidental .\nEverything is happening on purpose .\nEverything bad that is destroying our world is deliberate .\nThis is all part of the Great Reset and we are well into the ` endgame \u2019 .\nWe would be in less danger if we were being ruled by a world government consisting of Hitler , Stalin , Mussolini , Gaddafi , Attila the Hun ,

Nobody Notices", "content": "Behind the pseudo-scientific , computer-modeled canard known as \u2018 climate change , \u2019 sits an extremely dangerous and growing affront to society and indeed , to mankind itself .\nThis fifth column is manifesting under the guise of the Green New Deal , and is being ushered in under the banner of \u201c The Great Reset \u201d \u2013 a pernicious plan birthed out of the steering committees of the United Nations and the World Economic Forum .\nThe high committee pushing this agenda reads like a who \u2019 s who of the global elite and billionaire class , led by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the former head of the Bank of England , Mark Carney , media mogul Michael Bloomberg , and Larry Fink , CEO of the $ 8 trillion wealth management fund BlackRock , to name just a few .\nThere are a few underlying ideologies which this conclave uses to justify and advance their agenda , one of which is a committed belief in the primacy of fascism\u2026 Imagine \u2013 there is a Green Movement , supposedly environmentally friendly , people friendly .\nIt has a relatively short history , some 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wouldn \u2019 t like that ?\nGreen is beautiful .\nIt pretends to protect Mother Earth and Humanity .\nOver the years , it becomes increasingly popular and turns into a political party .\n\u201c The Greens \u201d .\nGrowing ever stronger throughout the Global West .\nThey talk about and predicate against men \u2019 s wasteful lifestyle .\nThey promote organic food and fight against genetically modified or GMO food .\nThey make inroads in western countries \u2019 Parliaments and become major decision-makers .\nThey turn the two decades old \u201c global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d into their agenda .\nClimate Change becomes soon the driving force of the Greens .\nMan-made Climate Change \u2013 meaning fossil fuel-caused carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) levels in 2022 peak almost at 420 parts per million ( PPM ) .\nThis , according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) weather station in Mauna Loa , on the island of Hawaii .\nNOAA \u2019 s 2022 budget is estimated at US $ 6.9 billion .\nIs this a dangerous level ?\nWe are made to believe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information into the Green \u2019 s agenda \u2013 worldwide .\nNever mind that global oceans absorb some 67 billion tons of carbon dioxide since the creation of NOAA in 27 years , from 1992 until 2018 .\nBut a complex system of \u201c positive and negative fluxes \u201d are creating an equilibrium , oceans also emit carbon dioxide into the air , namely when the concentration of CO2 in the water is higher than in the air .\nCO2 from the oceans help feed the plants on land , when they do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plants live off carbon dioxide and release oxygen into the atmosphere .\nWithout CO2 , no plants .\nNo oxygen .\nNo life .\nThis little detail is conveniently ignored by the climate gnomes , by the Greens .\nIt doesn \u2019 t fit into their agenda .\nMay the above explanation of positive and negative fluxes just be an illustration inspiring reflection on reality which is conveniently ignored by the climate freaks and especially by the Greens .\nThey have taken over a lucrative political movement , funded by philanthropists like Soros @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against meat-eaters , hoping to convert them into insect-eaters .\nThe Green Agenda is in the process of restraining people \u2019 s liberties by abject and deceitful mind manipulation .\nIn other words , humanity is made believe what isn \u2019 t .\nOne may ask , whose agenda is this ?\nAnd why are the Greens all over the Global North so eager to help promoting it ?\nPerhaps because it is part of a larger agenda of oppression , total control and transfer of assets from the bottom and middle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they are doing .\nJust look what they are doing to Germany .\nThey help ruining the German economy , and by association the EU economy .\nThis is a process well underway .\nThe Greens occupy five ministries in Germany , among them the two most powerful ones , Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and Economy Minister Robert Habeck .\nThey are responsible for promoting relentlessly the sanctions program against Russia \u2013 obviously dictated by the US \u2013 plunging Germany and by association Europe , potentially into the worst recession Europe has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s gas supply on which Germany \u2019 s economy depends to 50 % and the rest of Europe to a slightly lesser proportion .\nMs. Baerbock and Mr. Habeck , plus their Chancellor , Scholz , are at least co-responsible for accepting Washington \u2019 s dictate of the Russian sanctions program leading to Europe \u2019 s suicide .\nOthers like France \u2019 s Macron and the Netherland \u2019 s Mark Rutte and more of so-called European leaders , happily join the club .\nIt \u2019 s a wanton suicide , because they all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are doing it .\nThey are not working for the benefit of the European people , of their fellow countrymen , but for the benefit of the faltering empire and those who pull the strings even on Washington , like financial giants , BlackRock , Vanguard , StateStreet and Co .\nThese so-called leaders of the world , are betraying their people with miserable lies and a 24/7 indoctrination media machine , for the benefit of themselves and the financial giants which are poised to take over the world .\nSo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington \u2019 s dictate .\nThere may be something much bigger behind the Greens and their agenda ?\nPerhaps the World Economic Forum ( WEF ) \u2013 which in turn is the visible instrument of the all dominating financial sector , led by the forementioned BlackRock and Co. \u2013 and then some smaller but still big enough \u201c fish \u201d , like City Bank , Chase and more .\nAll those elegantly labeled , \u201c too big to fail and too big to jail \u201d .\nThe CEO \u2019 s and managers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some kind of \u201c compensation \u201d for playing along .\nFor sure , they know what they are doing \u2013 ruining the lives of their countries \u2019 people and economy .\nThat \u2019 s for sure worth a hefty reward , maybe a \u201c life-saving \u201d recompence .\nIn many parts of the world , especially in Europe , the Greens are still hailed as the saviors of environment and humanity , hardly anybody has noticed the conversion from green to brown , from their environmental-social agenda into outright fascism .\nAnd yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d , as the Gates Foundation , the Soros Fund , the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds .\nSomebody with a lot of credibility may connect the dots between climate crisis , ( geoengineering ) crop destruction ( famine and death ) , energy shortage during predicted ice-cold western winters , no heating , driving low resistance people into flu-like diseases , for which efficient remedies are withheld , so they get sick and many may die .\nCold winters will be an opportunity to administer flu \u201c vaxxes \u201d to the masses ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killing millions , because people still trust in flu-vaxxes and get them by the 100-dreds of thousands .\nSince their immune systems are already compromised from the various covid shots and boosters , many-many , maybe hundreds of thousands , may die .\nIndeed , form the flu shots .\nOfficial cause of death : Covid .\nA great argument for more covid vaxxes , and the spiral of life destruction goes on .\nWill people wake up , before it \u2019 s too late ?\nThen there is massive infrastructure destruction \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 by geoengineered weather ( see this ) , leading \u201c bankrotten \u201d countries , to seek monetary enslavement from IMF and the World Bank .\nClimate change-caused infrastructure destruction , further reduces energy consumption , heating reduction , fossil oil-based fertilizer production , leading to food shortages and death by famine , or famine-related diseases .\nThe agenda is perfect .\nAll plays into The Great Reset \u2019 s / UN Agenda \u2019 s 2030 population reduction scenarios , leaving at the end of the vaxx-decade , as WHO calls the 2020s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 financial hegemons \u2013 expect to joyfully benefit from the bankrupted small and medium size companies of which the assets were sucked up-up and away into the blue sky of the billionaires .\nThe usual villains , the financial giants , are calling the shots on the common survivors \u2013 maybe you and me \u2013 or the next generation .\nIf we don \u2019 t stand up , rise up to the next level of humanity , becoming from purely material beings , spiritual entities , vibrating on a higher cord , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being electronically manipulable , through algorithms or robots , for their benefit of the elite , of course , course , may be accepted voluntarily , because it \u2019 s so \u201c cool \u201d being a chipped transhumans , 5G-happy , while owning nothing .\nThat would be the end-stage .\nLargely facilitated by the legendary Greens turned Browns .\nIt won \u2019 t happen .\nWe are many , they are few , and we will resist without violence , with a brand-new non-material

generates real world harms for the indigenous Amazon tribes and rainforests which such schemes pretend to protect .\nI was recently lucky enough to be able to book a ferry from the UK to France .\nAfter years of stifling regulation on free movement , in August of 2022 , one could finally travel across the English Channel without nasal swabs , without saliva tests ; and without presenting government sanctioned barcodes .\nIt only took us 3 years to get over the coronavirus paranoia and back to a calmer state of affairs .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now on the booking page for the ferry something caught my eye .\nIt was an optional tickbox at the bottom of the form .\nIt said : \u201c Would you like to pay \u00a32.50 to offset the carbon footprint for your journey ?\n\u201d .\nThis piqued my interest and so I dug deeper .\nFor starters , I followed the link provided to carbonfootprint.com .\nIt explains the basics of a carbon footprint and the dogma of the greenhouse effect in excessively simple terms .\nIn fact there are a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here you can learn that : \u201c Climate Change ( also known as Global Warming ) [ has caused temperature rise ] \u2026 with increasingly levels of human activity.\n\u201d [ sic ] .\nIt reminds me of projects in school where someone would copy and paste sections of text from a website and hand it in as their own work .\nThus , I deemed this website no great authority on the subject .\nHowever , this company registered an income of over \u00a37 million in 2022 so far .\nThis money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which pretty much converts \u2018 miles travelled \u2019 to \u2018 tons of CO2 \u2019 and then offers a byway into a carbon offset marketplace .\nIn fact Carbon markets have expanded to over \u00a3250 billion in the last year , and the World Economic Forum points to it as the main means of fighting climate change1 .\nThis burgeoning carbon offset market is also being underpinned by the drive to force businesses into the new globalist corporate compliance scheme known as Environmental , Social and Governance ( ESG ) , which is supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial interests which are meant to focus on \u201c sustainable and ethical impacts.\n\u201d All in all , it looks like a great business to be in right now \u2013 people will throw money at you to assuage their guilt over the nefarious carbon they emit just by existing .\nThe ferry company simply offers a tickbox , funnelling money over to a middleman to purchase carbon offsets , also known as carbon credits , on your behalf .\nSo let \u2019 s dig deeper , into those services on offer\u2026 While browsing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find pictures of happy Malaysian coffee farmers , shiny solar panelled roofs and scenic wind farms rising over rolling hills .\nFrom an environmentalist perspective , there is no question as to the efficacy of these projects \u2013 their mere existence is a Carbon offset .\nIn theory , the amount of Carbon emissions saved by a wind farm is calculated as the amount of \u2018 clean \u2019 energy generated versus how much CO2 would be generated using solid fuel generators .\nThey do not take into account the high intensity coal burnt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turbine \u2019 s huge fins , nor the multiple intercontinental lorries and boats to transport the hundreds of meters of steel poles to the site , nor the metric tonnes of electric components which make up the turbine \u2019 s generator , the interim power stations and giant transformers , and many miles of cabling .\nI posit that those factors might actually offset any supposed \u2018 gains \u2019 from building such projects .\nNow these \u2018 renewable \u2019 projects make up only a small part of the carbon offset market .\nNote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind and sun is renewable , but the steel , copper , rare earth metals , oil , natural gas and coal used to build these projects are far from renewable .\nFurthermore , it is not in the interest of the Carbon profiteers to include these exogenous factors in their calculation as it would eat away their profit , and rot their moral argument of \u2018 saving the planet \u2019 .\nAs we dig deeper through the spongy loams of renewables , we find thicker clay below .\nThe biggest and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMost of the offerings in Carbon marketplaces are forests , particularly in East Asian , African and South American nations .\nThis is no coincidence , since the 1970s and the inception of \u201c Sustainable Development \u201d the North-South divide on environmentalism has existed .\nThe \u2018 North \u2019 is made up of the industrial empires of the last two centuries , also confusingly referred to as \u2018 the West \u2019 .\nI always seek to avoid using the loaded terms \u2018 developed nation \u2019 or \u2018 rich country/poor country \u2019 as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut it is this \u2018 North \u2019 which seeks to regulate the growth of the \u2018 South \u2019 as they ascend the ladder of industrialisation .\nWe will explore these themes further in Part two of the Carbon Credit Series .\nI will leave you with a quote from Brazilian Miguel Os\u00f3rio de Almeida in 1971 at the first Stockholm conference on climate : \u201c To be many and to be poor is offensive to the sights and feelings of developed countries .\nMost of their suggestions do not concern cooperation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers \u201d 2 Through this lens , the rosy photographs of rainforests feel more than a little phony .\nIn fact there is a false logic behind these forest investment vehicles .\nThe official Carbon offset offered by a forest is in fact the amount of CO2 the trees suck up each year , as they have for millennia .\nThe only value being packaged and sold on these marketplaces is not cutting down the trees .\nTherefore , by not cutting down a forest , the company is maintaining a \u2018 Carbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s carbon footprint .\nOne is paying the landowner for doing nothing .\nThis logic has an acronym , and it is slapped all over these heralded offset projects : REDD .\nThat is a UN scheme called \u2018 Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation \u2019 .\nI would re-name it to , \u2018 Sell off indigenous forests to global investors \u2019 .\nNow if you think my take is too strong , let us drill deeper into the bedrock of the issue .\nREDD projects say they protect forests .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ world through carbon markets .\nYet , the truth seems a lot less green .\nIn Indonesia for example , the Katingan REDD project has displaced indigenous farmers .\nThose farmers who use traditional farming techniques are no longer allowed into their ancient forest as it is now a global asset.3 It \u2019 s biggest creditor is Shell , the notorious multinational oil company .\nShell themselves present the project as part of their green washing initiative with a heartwarming page on their website4 .\nHowever , despite the claims to be protecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being converted to palm oil plantation amidst local corruption .\nThis means that even as ancient hardwoods are displaced for quick-profit palm oil trees .\nAmazingly , they still count the same in carbon credit terms .\nAll of this occurs whilst the forest had already been designated and protected by the Indonesian government decades previously .\nThat is not enough for REDD , who take over control of the forest on behalf of their creditors .\nMost shockingly though is the fact that these REDD \u2018 protectors \u2019 paid up by carbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rampage through 9000 hectares of the Katingan rainforest , emitting tonnes of CO2 in the process .\nOne investigator interrogated Verra , the carbon credit certification body about these wildfires : \u201c Dupont-Nivet asks whether Shell \u2019 s carbon credits will remain valid even if all of Shell \u2019 s \u201c climate forest \u201d goes up in smoke ?\n\u201c Correct , \u201d Swickard replies .\n\u201c We have done extensive analyses with scenarios and models to ensure robustness.\n\u201d 5 Well , we can sleep well at night knowing that Shell \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by \u201c analyses with scenarios and models to ensure robustness \u201d .\nAnd that the forest is safe in the hands of Permian Global , appointed by REDD to guard and protect their precious carbon offset forest .\nPermian Global is a Luxembourg-based finance firm created by ex-Barclays bankers , so these forests are in safe hands , I \u2019 m sure .\nNow in the climate change movement , no rainforest gets more attention than the Amazon .\nSometimes referred to as the lungs of the world , it \u2019 s also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of animal and plant .\nYet the cursory interest people have in \u2018 saving the Amazon \u2019 may not be doing any good .\nBy making the Amazon a target for conservation , the environmental movement has opened it up to financial exploitation by \u2018 green \u2019 financial vultures .\nLet us turn to Brazil , home of the Amazon rainforest , and therefore home to some of the worst abuses of nature in the name of carbon offsets .\nIf you invest money into Brazil , it \u2019 s likely to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Desenvolvimento Econ\u00f4mico e Social \u2013 the National Bank of Economic and Social Development .\nThe BNDES is a government owned investment vehicle which funnels international funds into Brazil .\nIn fact more than half of its funds go to private entities , thus it is essentially a public-private partnership .\nWhen a company buys and sells carbon credits in Brazil , the money goes through the BNDES .\nI see this as a problem , a point of vulnerability to corruption .\nWith billions of pesos slushing through its coffers , the BNDES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of profiteers .\nFor starters , you can read about the Car Wash scandal , unearthed in 2014 : where billions of funds from the BNDES were laundered through oil giant Petrobras .\nThe scandal ripped through the Brazilian political system like a wildfire rips through a protected Indonesian rainforest .\nSuch was the scale of the crisis it even has its own entry in the Encyclopedia Brittanica6 .\nEven whilst the BNDES was in hot water over rampant corruption , its activities continued.7 Not content with mere financial harm , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here we have one of the most egregious cases of carbon credit corruption .\nFunds given in good intention eventually percolated down through to generate real world harms to the Amazon and her peoples .\nWe turn to the case of the Belo Monte Dam\u2026 Belo Monte is to be the 3rd largest dam in the world .\nIt blocks the Xingu River in central Brazil , and a tributary of the great Amazon River .\nThe river runs through acres of indigenous tribal lands and pristine rainforest .\nThe proposed cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion , although anyone who has built an enormous hydroelectric dam knows that these costs can expand as the project unfolds .\nThe dam would go on to double in price .\nThe BNDES approved a loan in 2012 to Norte Energia SA of $ 10.8billion for the dam .\nYet even then there were questions as to the efficacy of the dam .\nPlans had been pushed through without great oversight as to the viability of the dam \u2019 s hydroelectric capacity \u2013 supposedly to produce up to a third of Brazil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a political pressure group , actually did a study in 2011 to show that Belo Monte would never generate enough electricity to break even on cost.8 \u201c Critics allege that Brazil \u2019 s energy planning , and BNDES funding of dams , is focused on awarding large contracts to big construction companies rather than on the public good , with near total disregard for the dams \u2019 economic viability , environmental impacts and indigenous harm in the Amazon.\n\u201d 9 What happened when the project was undertaken was criminal , on many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River \u2019 s flow was diverted , with massive ramifications to the wildlife and people of the river .\nSeven indigenous tribes had their lands flooded and destroyed .\nWithout that , many of them have sadly disappeared \u2013 a clear case of ethnocide .\nFurthermore , industrial activity has negatively affected many other tribes in the region .\nThe Belo Monte , or \u201c Beautiful Mountain \u201d Dam , actually entailed ripping apart multiple hillsides , deforesting and digging out the fragile soils .\nDynamite was used extensively to blow up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhen responding to a piece on the project by investigative journalists , the BNDES stated : \u201c The BNDES did not \u201c contribute \u201d with money to help the construction of hydroelectric plants .\nWhat we do is to provide loans that are being repaid , with interest .\nThe BNDES \u2019 operations generate income and jobs in Brazil , and the Bank is very profitable\u2026 \u201d 9 Not only is the BNDES a profitable enterprise for international white collar criminal class , but it is a vessel for the new carbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper , which investigated 12 REDD projects in the Amazon found that carbon credit schemes consistently overstated carbon emission reductions .\nIn particular , they highlighted the profit incentive as a reason for this obfuscation .\n\u201c Results suggest that the accepted methodologies for quantifying carbon credits overstate impacts on avoided deforestation and climate change mitigation.\n\u201d 10 As we will elucidate in part two of this article , there is a whole industry of carbon cowboys : those groups of people who do the \u2018 green washing \u2019 on behalf of big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creative carbon accounting , they routinely inflate the perceived benefit of carbon sinks and forests , pretending they will absorb millions of tons of CO2 , in order to justify massive investments , and in the case of Brazil \u2013 massive public debt .\nThey then sell these financial instruments on at a huge profit \u2013 without having any accountability to the biosphere in question , namely the forests or their residents affected by these \u2018 green \u2019 projects .\nNor do they have any accountability to the buyers of their carbon credits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or just innocent ferry passengers who thought that ticking a box on the website would help make the world a better , cleaner and safer place , for the bargain price of just \u00a32.50 .\nWe should be wary of these carbon credit schemes .\nWith so little oversight , and even less real science to back up their claims of efficacy , and with such incredible mismanagement \u2013 this growing green financial sector offers huge incentives for corruption .\nThe end result of all of this can and will be tragic .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially when we consider what benefit that money and energy could have had .\nWhilst millions suffer from poverty in the slums of Brazil , their government channels billions of dollars to private pockets behind their backs .\nUnviable dams are allowed to flood indigenous tribes and priceless rainforests , all in the name of preventing climate change .\nThis is why I am wary of shallow environmental statements and groups which demand that we \u201c Act Now !\n\u201d 11 without offering deeper insights into the real-world implications of that action .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a \u2018 rush to war \u2019 such as happened in Iraq in 2003 , which was said at the time to be justified on humanitarian grounds , which led to the West ushering in an era of violent terror in the region , still raging today at an incalculable cost of human suffering and environmental degradation .\nLet \u2019 s not do the same in the name of climate change .\n2 Miguel Os\u00f3rio de Almeida quote \u201c To be many and to be poor is offensive\u2026

Control and Prevention \u2019 s ( CDC ) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices .\nOffit is also one of the few vaccine experts voicing caution regarding the new COVID boosters .\nOn Aug. 31 , the FDA granted emergency use authorizations ( EUAs ) of COVID-19 boosters from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech .\nThe bivalent version of the previous vaccines are for use as a single booster dose at least two months following primary or booster vaccination .\nModerna \u2019 s mRNA booster shots are approved by the FDA for individuals 18 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pfizer-BioNTech version is authorized for those 12 or older .\nHowever , Offit is advising healthy young people to skip the new booster shot .\nDuring an appearance on CNN earlier this month , Offit said that those over 65 , the immuno-compromised , and anyone with serious chronic health ailments could benefit from the boosters .\nHe was concerned that government health agencies were going to try to oversell the booster to everyone .\n\u201c What I fear is that they \u2019 re going to say everybody should get it when in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unlikely to benefit from the booster dose , and so I hope they targeted more specifically , to those really who are most likely to benefit from this additional dose , \u201d he said during the CNN interview .\nThe CNN anchor was perplexed that the health official didn \u2019 t recommend everyone get the new jab .\nShe asked the vaccine expert , \u201c Why not get it ?\nRight ?\nIf it does give you even if it \u2019 s a smaller benefit , is there any reason not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201c I think that when you \u2019 re asking people to get a vaccine , I think there has to be clear evidence of benefit , and we \u2019 re not going to have clinical studies before this launches.\n\u201d Moderna has begun human trials on the booster shots , and Pfizer is expected to begin theirs this month .\nExperts believe that trials likely wouldn \u2019 t be completed until the spring .\n\u201c But you \u2019 d like to have at least human data people you know , getting this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatic increase in neutralizing antibodies , and then at least you have a correlate of protection against BA.4 and BA.5 , \u201d he continued .\n\u201c You \u2019 re asking people to get a new product for which there \u2019 s no data , \u201d Offit also told CNN .\n\u201c Mice data are not adequate to launch 100-plus-billion-dose effort.\n\u201d The booster shot was authorized by the FDA despite not having been tested on humans .\nPfizer \u2019 s preliminary findings were based on tests on eight mice .\nThe FDA based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mice , data from current COVID-19 vaccines , and earlier iterations of boosters .\n\u201c Because if you don \u2019 t have that , if there \u2019 s not clear evidence of benefit , then it \u2019 s not fair I think to ask people to take a risk no matter how small , \u201d Offit declared .\n\u201c The benefit should be clear.\n\u201d On Sept. 21 , Offit wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal titled : \u201c CDC Oversells the \u2018 Bivalent \u2019 Covid Shot.\n\u201d \u201c The Centers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone over 12 receive a \u2018 bivalent \u2019 COVID-19 vaccine as a booster dose , \u201d he wrote .\n\u201c But only a select group are likely to benefit , and the evidence to date doesn \u2019 t support the view that a bivalent vaccine containing omicron or its subvariants is better than the monovalent vaccine .\nThe CDC risks eroding the public \u2019 s trust by overselling the new shot.\n\u201d Americans are not rushing to get the latest booster shot .\nAccording to CDC data released on Thursday , an estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThat figure represents approximately 1.5 % of people in the U.S. who are eligible to receive the

"content": "A small but groundbreaking study ( available here ) has been released at the Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA ) Pediatrics , demonstrating that trace amounts of COVID-19 vaccine mRNA were found in the breastmilk of lactating women as soon as one hour after vaccination .\nThis study was conducted from February to October 2020 ( more on that in a moment ) , and included only 11 lactating women , 5 of whom received the Moderna vaccine and 6 of whom received the Pfizer vaccine .\nThe comparison was made between their pre-vaccine breastmilk ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results ?\nThe breastmilk of 5 out of 11 women tested had detectable COVID-19 vaccine mRNA in their breastmilk .\nFor those keeping score , that is 45 % \u2013 nearly half \u2013 of the study group .\nOf course , given the limited sample size , this doesn \u2019 t mean that the COVID-19 vaccine mRNA will be absent from breastmilk after 45 hours .\nWe \u2019 ve already seen that the spike protein/mRNA can last for months after vaccination .\nAccording to one study summarized by Dr. Robert Malone : Back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authors : They speculate that following the administration of a COVID-19 vaccine , \u201c lipid nanoparticles containing the vaccine mRNA are carried to mammary glands via hematogenous and/or lymphatic routes.\n\u201d The limitations of this study are unfortunate .\nThere were only 11 participants , and the authors observe there is a \u201c lack of functional studies demonstrating whether detected vaccine mRNA is translationally active.\n\u201d This means that the safety of post-vaccination breastmilk is unknown .\nDespite the lack of evidence demonstrating safety , the authors conclude : \u201c The sporadic presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detected in EBM suggest that breastfeeding after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination is safe , particularly beyond 48 hours after vaccination.\n\u201d That conclusion on safety is weakened , if not contradicted , by their own advice : \u201c \u2026 caution is warranted about breastfeeding children younger than 6 months in the first 48 hours after maternal vaccination until more safety studies are conducted.\n\u201d And what does the study mean by advising \u201c caution \u201d ?\nThey fail to provide specifics , but it seems they study \u2019 s authors are hinting at stopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until more information is available .\nOur educated guess is supported by the authors \u2019 conclusions about the lack of safety data , specifically : \u2022 They \u201c did not test the possible cumulative vaccine mRNA exposure after frequent breastfeeding in infants.\n\u201d \u2022 \u201c The potential interference of COVID-19 vaccine mRNA with the immune response to multiple routine vaccines given to infants during the first 6 months of age needs to be considered.\n\u201d Were these findings hidden from the public ?\nThere \u2019 s something else curious about this study .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the study was \u201c conducted from February to October 2020.\n\u201d If that is true ( and we recognize the potential for author error ) , then the study has been suppressed for nearly two years .\nYou can \u2019 t help but guess that the reason was to not contribute to vaccine hesitancy .\nUnfortunately , publication delays allowed for contrary findings from more limited studies to take-hold and mislead the public about the lack of vaccine mRNA in breastmilk .\nIt should be no surprise that the findings of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the officials at the FDA and CDC who guaranteed the vaccines were \u201c safe and effective \u201d for pregnant women .\nThose promises were always questionable , as they are unsupported by the claims of the vaccine manufacturers themselves , who asserted : Available data on COMIRNATY/SPIKEVAX administered to pregnant women \u201c are insufficient to inform vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy.\n\u201d It has long been the case that Moderna and Pfizer are less convinced than the CDC/FDA about the pregnant rat studies : Anyway , in the face of the warning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasis on the unknowns of safety data for infants , the CDC still recommends the COVID-19 for women who are breastfeeding : \u201c CDC recommends COVID-19 vaccines for everyone ages 6 months and older , including people who are pregnant , breastfeeding , trying to get pregnant now , or might become pregnant in the future and getting boosters , if eligible.\n\u201d As to Pfizer and Moderna claims about lactation ?\nBoth vaccine manufacturers currently say it is \u201c not known \u201d whether their vaccines are \u201c excreted in human milk.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study , I \u2019 m guessing it \u2019 s because they didn \u2019 t bother to take a look .\nSee more at Techno Fog

\u2013 and to withhold treatment which might save their lives .\nHospital staff are told to deprive the elderly of food and water so that they die rather than take up hospital beds .\nNursing home staff have even been given the right to sedate elderly patients without their knowledge .\nThe only -ism that no one cares about is ageism .\nBut at what age are patients simply allowed to die ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients to be resuscitated ?\nAt what point does society have the right to say \u2018 You \u2019 ve lived long enough , now you must die and make way for someone else \u2019 ?\nAnd why should resuscitation be decided by age ?\nIt is possible to argue that it would make as much sense to decide according to wealth or beauty .\nBut ageism is now officially accepted .\nAnyone over 60 is now officially old , though in a growing number of hospitals the cut off age for resuscitation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct world but the elderly don \u2019 t count \u2013 particularly if they are white and English .\nReport after report after report shows elderly patients being left in pain , in soiled bed clothes .\nElderly patients in hospital are ignored by staff and left to starve to death , denied even water if they can not get out of bed and fetch it themselves .\nOld people are a burden which the Government can not afford and so the politicians will continue to authorise whatever methods are necessary to ensure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept to a minimum .\nThe existence of an absurd branch of medicine called geriatrics is used as an excuse to shove old people into backwater wards and to provide them with second-rate medical treatment .\nIn February 2011 , an official report condemned the NHS for its ` inhumane treatment of elderly patients \u2019 and stated that NHS hospitals were \u2018 failing to meet even the most basic standards of care \u2019 for the over-65s .\nIt is no exaggeration to say that the NHS treats the elderly with contempt .\n( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can judge a civilisation by the way it treats its elderly . )\nIt was back in February 2005 that it was revealed that the Government had advised that hospital patients with little hope of recovery should be allowed to die because of the cost of keeping them alive .\nThe Labour Government suggested that ` old people \u2019 be denied the right to food and water if they fell into a coma or couldn \u2019 t speak for themselves .\nSo much for any hope for stroke victims .\nThe Government suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the need to preserve the lives of patients and decided it had the right to overturn a right-to-life ruling which had been made when a judge ordered that artificial nutrition and hydration should not be withdrawn unless the life of a patient could be described as \u2018 intolerable \u2019 .\n( The judge had added that when there was any doubt , preservation of life should take precedence . )\nOf course , depriving the elderly of food and water is sometimes more a consequence of incompetence than official policy .\nWhen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t feed herself , but the staff didn \u2019 t feed her .\nIf no relative could get to the hospital to feed her she didn \u2019 t eat .\nDrinks were put on her tray and then taken away untouched .\n` Not thirsty , today ?\n\u2019 an idiot would ask merrily .\nMeanwhile , the Government pours money into subsidising the lives of the lazy and the work-shy .\nHealthy 30-year-olds sit around growing chip backsides and beer bellies , slumped in front of their high definition digital television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satellite television , opening the windows to let the heat out because it \u2019 s easier than turning down the central heating .\nThe elderly are classified as the \u2018 Unwanted Generation \u2019 : a political embarrassment .\nElderly individuals facing blindness from age-related macular disease are denied drugs that might have prevented their blindness .\nThe elderly are considered expensive , useless and expendable .\nThe theory is that they don \u2019 t contribute and rarely vote and can , therefore , be disregarded .\nBut those who believe this will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the definition of \u2018 old \u2019 is getting younger by the year .\nWars have taught us that people seem to be prepared to accept as normal all sorts of terrible things .\nBut how unbelievably awful it is that doctors and nurses accept that the elderly ( officially the over 60s ) must be allowed to die because keeping them alive isn \u2019 t cost effective .\nThe official attitude seems to be that old people don \u2019 t matter and don \u2019 t have rights simply because they are old .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee on Human Rights , comprised of MPs and peers , reported that 21 % of hospitals and care homes failed to meet even minimum standards of dignity and privacy for older people .\nThe Committee said it had uncovered evidence of neglect , abuse , discrimination and unfair treatment of frail , older people .\n( Their discovery came as no surprise to those of us who have been uncovering such abuse for decades . )\nHow have we managed to forget that in the 1930s the Nazis deliberately starved and dehydrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded as a useless burden on society ?\nThat is exactly what we are doing today .\nAn astonishing ( and horrifying ) survey conducted among readers of the journals Nursing Standard and Nursing Older People showed that fewer than one in six nurses said that nothing would prevent them from reporting abuse of older people in their care .\nIn other words five out of six nurses would , at least sometimes , fail to report abuse of the elderly people they were being paid to look after .\nSo , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nurses aren \u2019 t fit to be nurses .\nWould these same nurses ignore the abuse of children so easily ?\nThis is utterly appalling and an indictment of the modern nursing profession .\nThe same survey showed that six out of ten nurses would turn a blind eye to the abuse of the elderly .\nThey would say nothing if they knew that an elderly patient or care home resident was being beaten , bullied or robbed .\nWhy are nurses failing their patients ?\nUnbelievably , it seems that nurses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they themselves are abused by the person doing the abuse .\nAnother reason is , apparently , \u2018 fear of misinterpreting the situation \u2019 .\nWhat sort of political correct garbage is that ?\nHospital patients and nursing home residents now often suffer malnutrition and dehydration , abuse and rough treatment , lack of privacy , neglect , poor hygiene and bullying .\nThousands and thousands of elderly people are left for hours in soiled clothes .\nHow can anyone \u2018 misinterpret \u2019 any of that ?\nCan it be because too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incompetent ?\nIs it because too many are far too self-important to do anything other than stare at a computer screen all day long ?\nIn my view , nurses who say nothing when they see abuse are as guilty as the abusers .\nA once great profession is , today , in a worse state than it was in the days of Dickens .\nIs it so very old-fashioned of me to believe that every nurse should always report every incident of abuse ?\nAlways .\nWithout exception .\nAgeism is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care .\nA reader wrote to tell me that when she visited her doctor complaining of painful knees her doctor told her , very abruptly , that her problem was that she was living too long .\nShe was devastated .\n\u2018 It wasn \u2019 t said as a joke , \u2019 she told me .\n\u2018 He meant it.\n\u2019 In the months before he died my father repeatedly complained : \u2018 People treat me like a fool because I am old \u2019 .\nA 79-year-old reader told me : \u2018 If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead because you \u2019 re too expensive alive.\n\u2019 We now live in a world where it is considered acceptable for men and women to have to share a ward ; where hospital bathrooms are so dirty that patients dare not use them ; where dentists are so scarce and expensive that people have to resort to pulling their own bad teeth with the aid of a length of string tied to a doorknob .\nBut it is the elderly who , above all others , are regarded as disposable and irrelevant .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights .\nSexism and racism are outlawed , but ageism is not .\nIndeed , it seems clear that ageism is now a State sponsored prejudice .\nViolent , feral youths who are caught assaulting elderly law-abiding citizens are likely to be \u2018 punished \u2019 with a fistful of vouchers entitling them to a handful of free CDs ( the lyrics of which may well encourage more violence ) , but honest , elderly citizens who , can not afford to pay their council tax bill will end up in prison .\nWhen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government \u2019 s priorities take over .\nAnd so the elderly , who are regarded as an expensive burden , are considered expendable .", "author": "NEWS WIRE", "url":

agenda ?\nOn November 27 , 2018 , in the mist of another weekend marked by another revolt of the Gillets Jaunes , aka the \u201c Yellow Vests , \u201d who were protesting against the unbearable increases in fuel prices and various \u2018 green \u2019 taxes , France \u2019 s current President Emmanuel Macron declared during the presentation of the multi-year energy policy meeting that 14 nuclear reactors , each producing circa 900 megawatts , will be shut down by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 2030 .\nThe French president took this opportunity to announce the closure of the Fessenheim nuclear plant , located near the French-German border , in the summer of 2020 .\nIn contrast to the law \u2019 s initial aim of 2025 , he confirmed that the nuclear contribution was to be cut to 50 % of electricity output by 2035 .\nThe question then remains : why would France make the same mistake as Germany by rolling back its nuclear fleet , and can the France economy and society survive after losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nNuclear Power plants and reactors to be closed by 2035 in France ( Source : ASN.FR \u2013 LPComputer Graphics ) This is all part of the planned take-down of European economy .\nIt starts with the \u2018 green \u2019 deception .\nOnshore wind power and increase in photovoltaic plants in France were part of Macron \u2019 s proposed energy mix from day one and to this day the French still remember Macrons famous apocalyptic pronouncement : \u201c End of the world , \u201d or \u201c end of the month , \u201d and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both , and we must deal with both.\n\u201d Was World Economic Forum Young leader Emmanuel Macron already on a mission to prepare the ground for Schwab \u2019 s Great Reset and 4th Industrial Revolution , and these terrible energy policy decisions come back to haunt him ?\nThe answer is yes , absolutely .\nThe issue of French nuclear output is at the very center of all conversations in France these days , and despite summer coming to an end , and the dwindling Russian gas deliveries , people still want answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power supply crisis that has plagued the entire EU for the past six months , driving up inflation and forcing industries to slow down \u2013 or even shut down their production lines , member states of the EU are now being forced to pour enormous amounts of money into tax cuts , subsidies , handouts , and bailouts .\nAfter the Yellow Vest protests , a shaky Macron government realised that in the short term at least , consumer energy process needed to be capped in order to avoid massive public protests again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge cost to EDF .\nThis is only the tip of the iceberg though .\nSince August 29 , 2022 , when electricity rates on the French wholesale market went hyperbolic , Emmanuel Macron has been under fire from a number of people for his extremely poor track record , and his very questionable motives .\nMore than any other European nation , France is reliant on nuclear energy which produces nearly 70 % of its power .\nThe energy crisis that is crippling Europe at the moment has reawakened the debate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s 32 nuclear reactors which have been forced to shut down for maintenance , mostly to address corrosion and other \u2018 wear and tear \u2019 issues .\nThe economic repercussions this energy crisis is having on key industry sectors is visible , not to mention the fear and anxiety that is once more being injected into the populations .\nWith 32 reactors out of 56 reactors shut down , one can only conclude that this was the promise Macron made to his globalist cohort in order to fulfill the UN 2030 Agenda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pledge has yet to be fully carried out , it is nonetheless had a big impact on the country \u2019 s nuclear power generation .\nEDF ( Electricit\u00e9 de France ) CEO Jean-Bernard L\u00e9vy did not hesitate to make this critical situation assessment during the Medef-organized meeting of top French entrepreneurs which coincidentally was launched by the unavoidable President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky on August 29th 2022 .\nJean-Bernard L\u00e9vy made it clear from the get-go that the state-owned French energy giant EDF was under serious pressure because they lacked \u201c tools \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its operations in a timely manner .\n\u201c We don \u2019 t we have a problem of expertise , we just don \u2019 t have enough teams that are qualified \u201d said L\u00e9vy , adding that : \u201c The nuclear fleet would fall ; prepare to close the plants and the reactors , we were told \u201d , as he recalled .\nForeseeing this possibility necessitated \u201c not hiring personnel to develop \u201d reactors , but rather \u201c to shut them down.\n\u201d Incredibly , France is not able to supply its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management , this demonstrates why the closure of four major nuclear plants is currently affecting the electricity output of France .\nSuch statement put Jean Bernard L\u00e9vy \u2019 s name on the path to Macron \u2019 s black list , and in record time France was launching a hunt for a new EDF CEO , whilst setting money aside for full nationalisation .\nMore than ever , Macron is governing like a French monarch , yet curious remaining a vassal of Europe and the United States .\nOne of Europe \u2019 s largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state already holds an 84 % interest , is essential to France \u2019 s nuclear plan , which the government is relying on to mitigate the effects of high energy prices .\nUntil recently , EDF was a highly efficient monopolistic producer and distributor of electricity ( France being the biggest exporter of electricity in Europe ) .\nBut our dysfunctional government forces them to sell over a quarter of their production to private resellers at mere cost ( 49 euros per MWH ) .\nHow is this possible ?\nThis resulted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income \u2013 leaving the country \u2019 s energy infrastructure ( upkeep of nuclear power plants ) in a financial hole , along with the perverse madness that obliges EDF , because of its reduced capacity , to buy electricity on the open market at 1000 euros , and to forcibly \u201c sell \u201d the supply to those private companies at 49 euros \u2013 at a loss of 28 billion euros this year .\nMacron \u2019 s government was left with no other choice but to say EDF is \u2018 too big to fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billions of taxpayer euros .\n\u201c A daylight robbery under our very noses , and not one word from the MSM.\n\u201d Emmanuelle Wargon , president of the Energy Regulatory Commission said on Monday 19th September 2022 , \u201c The French may not escape targeted power cuts this winter \u201d , adding that this extreme scenario was plausible under certain conditions .\n\u201c If it gets really cold this winter and Electricit\u00e9 de France ( EDF ) is late in reopening the nuclear reactors , we will go into exceptional measures , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must understand why Macron is implementing energy restrictions following the shortage he himself has engineered ; is it to appease environmentalists , or to please his EU German masters and their very unpopular European Green Deal ( and self-imposed energy deficit by shunning Russian gas ) ?\nOr is there a far more sinister agenda at play here ?\nIn the event of a gas shortage , \u201c we do not cut off individuals \u201d , assured Emmanuelle Wargon during an interview for France Info .\n\u201c As for electricity , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case scenario , to engage in targeted power cuts ( load shedding ) for a few hours at the level of a municipality or a district.\n\u201d Remember , this is the official narrative , but as usual the reality is likely different .\nLooking at many of Wargon \u2019 s speeches on national TV , we can sense that she was clearly brought in by Macron not only to infantilise the population , but more importantly to create a diversion from the real reason behind these upcoming power cuts which I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing the social media war regarding vaccines , and Ukraine .\nHowever , the one they really need to win is climate change .\nThey are still riding the sick renewable energy horse in order to please their financial and political sponsors at confabs like the UN Climate Summit and the World Economic Forum .\nThey most likely would like to avoid having people dying of cold this winter , but of course they might still accept a bivalent booster shot ( of fear ) for the population .\nThey are probably telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Having said that , what the progressive liberal class are 100 % focused on at the moment in Europe , is the disintegration of industries in Spain , Italy , France , Germany and other EU countries , namely the production of steel , aluminum , zinc , and silicon .\nWe are now seeing foundries in France and in many other EU countries having to face the electricity costs that are making their operations unsustainable .\nBusinesses are being hit very hard by a sudden spike in overhead costs , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disruptions in supply chains .\nFor instance , faced with rising energy prices , the Dechaumont Foundry in France expects to see its overhead bills to rise from 1.5 million to 10 million euros next year .\nThis is simply unsustainable .\nIts director denounces the volatility of electricity prices and fears having to go out of business if nothing is done .\nNyrstar , part of commodities giant Trafigura , has temporarily close its zinc smelter in Budel , in the Netherlands , from September 1st .\nIn its press release , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision for \u201c various external factors that have an impact \u201d , but it is clear that this is mainly due to high energy prices .\nNyrstar has already cut production by almost 50 % at its three European zinc smelters The details of this development were reported by Reuters in this article which also outlines how China won \u2019 t be coming to the rescue anytime soon .\n\u201c China lacks meaningful zinc export capacity to relieve ex-China shortages .\nPort congestion and high freight costs will also continue to frustrate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently witnessing a controlled demolition of the western economy \u2013 where a self-inflicted energy crisis on the back of the West \u2019 s proxy war in Ukraine is currently underway .\nDue to a series of deliberate government policy decisions , the global supply chain is being seriously disrupted , and if you add to this the souring price of the raw materials , we must anticipate a chain of events that will bring the collapse of several strategic industrial sectors in Europe , which will trigger even more unemployment , poverty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 months from now .\nAs for Germany , Europe \u2019 s largest economy could shrink by 0.7 % in 2023 , according to the OECD \u2019 s latest forecast , with the organization citing rising energy prices and power disruptions as the reason for the continued downturn , all of which confirms our controlled demolition hypothesis .\nStrangely enough , for the second time this month , Germany has reconfirmed its reliance on nuclear energy to face the energy crisis .\nGerman Economy Minister Robert Habeck ( pictured above ) announced on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants would remain operational during the winter of 2023 due to the unavailability of many French reactors , said France Info .\nTo ensure the energy supply in Germany , \u201c the Isar 2 power station ( near Munich ) and that of Neckarwestheim ( southwest ) will remain connected in the first quarter of 2023 \u201d , due to \u201c the situation in France being worse than we expected \u201d , Habeck said at a recent press conference in Berlin .\nThe decision to extend these two German power stations confirms the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 by Steffi Lemke , the German environmental minister , whose party is historically deeply anti-nuclear .\nIntegrity seems to be the last of their concerns .\nWe have come to realise that to understand the European Commission \u2019 s strange behavior , and their current exotic energy and foreign policies , one should perhaps look into the past and see if a self-destructive attitude , as currently displayed by the European Commission President Ursula Van Der Leyen and other European WEF young leaders , could be observed on a different continent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of industrialisation .\nHas any of this happened before ?\nI will posit that the Oil Shock of 1978\u201379 certainly qualifies , and could provide some of the answers , as well as help us to better understand the origins of the globalists \u2019 orchestrated meltdown of the global economy .\nThis is also instructive in identifying the crucial role the banking cartel \u2019 s financial system is playing by creating inflation which is driving the world towards severe contraction in economic activity , and total chaos on so many fronts .\nAdditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the WEF \u2019 s \u201c Great Reset \u201d plan , and which may explain the decisions and moves recently observed on the international stage whose results can be felt at this moment in time across the western world and beyond .\nIn 1978 , despite increasing concern among the public about the declining value of the US dollar and rapid pace of inflation , considerable concern was expressed that the rate of inflation might accelerate significantly as the year progressed triggering difficult questions concerning the appropriate role of monetary policy .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panic with no clear path to stabilization .\nThe Carter \u2019 s administration decision to appoint Paul Volcker was allegedly effective in reducing inflation , but the monetary contraction combined with the impact from the oil price shock \u2013 pushed the economy into the most severe recession since the Great Depression and triggered waves of popular opposition .\nVolker \u2019 s true intention remained unclear until November 9 , 1978 , and of course we will analyze the \u201c why \u201d in a moment .\nThe Trilateral Commission \u2018 s role in orchestrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 1977\u20131981 is well documented , and that includes the push for the so-called era of \u201c globalization , \u201d as well as former Vice President Gore \u2019 s relentless effort to create a \u201c post-industrial society \u201d under the guise of fighting climate change \u2013 all which has been overt manifestations of a global plan of control to bring about a financial regime change which requires a constant state of emergency and subsequently a population in a constant state of fear .\nThe radical changes implemented by both the Nixon and Carter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts of self-destruction of America , were instrumental in bringing about the gradual dismantling of this once glorious republic \u2013 a process which continues up to this very day .\nTime has now come for Europe to undergo this transformation , better known as the 4th Industrial Revolution , the key pillar of the UN \u2019 s Agenda 2030 .\nIt \u2019 s crucial to understand the very root of this Saturnian agenda and the motivations of its architects , as well as the implications associated with their proposed new economic world order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origins of the so-called \u201c Great Reset \u201d can be traced back to the Council on Foreign Relations \u2019 CFR Project 1980s , when the name of Klaus Schwab and World Economic Forum didn \u2019 t mean anything yet .\nThis deep state project was articulated by the trilateral commission whose members were embedded in the Jimmy Carter administration among them ; Zbigniew Brzezi\u0144ski , President Carter \u2019 s National Security Advisor from 1977 to 1981 , as well as Werner Michael Blumenthal , US Secretary of the Treasury from 1977 to 1979 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States Secretary of Defense from 1977 to 1981 , and also Cyrus Vance , Secretary of State and Head of Project 1980s Working Group , and of course Paul Adolph Volcker Jr who served as the 12th chairman of the Federal Reserve from 1979 to 1987 and was the spokesman of CFR \u2019 s Project 1980s .\nFor insight on the Trialteralists , readers should also follow the work of author and researcher Patrick Wood author of Trilaterals Over Washington : Volumes I & II , and also his Trilateral Commission archive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s Project 1980s \u2013 The policy of \u2018 controlled disintegration \u2019 EIR Economics by Richard Freeman In 1971 , during the Nixon presidency , Volcker played an important role in the removal of the gold standard , which then gave birth to a floating exchange rate system ( the beginning of the end of the real economy ) , and the rise of the petrodollar .\nOn November 9th 1978 , prior to becoming the Chairman of the US Federal Reserve and pushing the interest rate up to an unheard of 21.5 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lecture , \u201c The Political Economy of the Dollar , \u201d at the Warwick University in England , and this is what he said : \u201c A control disintegration of the economy is a legitimate object for the 1980s.\n\u201d This sentence encapsulates the very spirit of the Trilateral Commission and CFR \u2019 s \u201c Project 1980s \u201d and the desire of the self-styled Masters of the World to engage in a control demolition of the western world and global economy \u2013 which certainly mirrors the dark time we are currently living .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ already well underway , using the COVID-19 pandemic , climate change , and now the war in Ukraine , as their launching platform to propel us towards a digital black hole where your fundamental rights and privacy will eventually disappear .\nWhat Volcker Really Meant by \u2018 Controlled Disintegration \u2019 From EIR Economics by David Goldman .\nAll these manufactured events will be cleverly used to explain the increase of energy prices , food prices , healthcare costs , and the general cost of living \u2013 in ways most of us have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have already figured out , this agenda is cleverly designed to set in motion a controlled collapse the US and the EU economies , paralyzing the European SME \u2019 s which are the very lungs of both continents \u2019 economy .\nUpon their collapse ( if we let it happen ) , rest assure that vultures such as Vanguard or BlackRock will be more than happy to purchase them for pennies on the dollar when we eventually reach negative growth .\nRemember what the WEF infamously said , \u2018 you will own nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blueprint for extinction , and Klaus Schwab World Economic Forum bible if you will .\nIt had ten working groups , which worked during the 1970s , eventually producing 33 books .\nThe CFR \u2019 s Project 1980 blueprint for economics was outlined in the book \u201c Alternatives to Monetary Disorder \u201c , authored by Fred Hirsch .\nHirsch was the former editor of the London Economist magazine , and it is he whom Volcker quoted in his infamous 1978 lecture announcing his policy wrote EIR Economics contributor David Goldman in 1999 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ 26 , 2022 speech delivered by Chairman of the Federal Reserve , Jer\u00f4me Powell , addressing the topic of price stability and inflation control tools , including the possibility of using the Volker magic wand .\nSurely that should tell you something !\nAlthough it is true that it is necessary to take liquidity out of the speculative system , when observing the electricity prices or food prices souring to new heights , one must question the reason why Russia and the Ukrainian conflicts is being constantly blamed instead of the unimaginable pumping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and EU economic system during the Covid 19 pandemic ?\nIt was QE on steroids , and yet few in government and media will dare speak of it .\nThe best analysis of these correlations was made by Harley Schlanger in his recent video titled , \u201c The Trilateral Commission \u2019 s Project 1980s : Origins of the Great Reset , \u201d which I have paraphrased on several occasions in this article , as his work was crucial and instrumental to reconcile and complete my research .\nSo all credits should go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to do with production slowdown or a sudden lack of consumption said Harley , but only a cunning subterfuge to hide the debt bubble and keep countries like France under the tight leash of a German-dominated European Union and the banking cartels .\nBearing in mind that 10 % of France \u2019 s debt is indexed not on the inflation in France \u2013 but on the overall inflation in the Euro Zone .\nHence , the possibility of France falling into bankruptcy , like Greece in 2011 , has become a reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand why the neoliberals prefer blaming COVID-19 , or Russia \u2019 s Special Military Operation in Ukraine \u2013 in order to cover up the biggest corporate Public Private Partnership heist of all time .\nSee this article about the indexing of France debt on EU inflation .\nAnd the speculation \u2019 s show must go on\u2026 .\nThose who are looking into the current economic policies to explain this phenomenon are wasting their time since Volker \u2019 s fight against inflation was only motivated by the primary ideology behind \u201c Project 1980\u2033 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disintegration of an old Economic system identical in many aspects to the current globalist \u2019 s initiative known as the World Economic Forum \u201c The Great Reset \u201d .\nRemember , things will never be the same , and we won \u2019 t be going back to \u2018 the old ways \u2019 said Herr Schwab .\nAgain , everything is becoming clearer now that we can actually revisit the original blueprints of this agenda .\nThat the Trilateralists \u2019 Project 1980s provided the blueprints for the Great Reset is all but undeniable now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a neo feudal system , where the self-proclaimed oligarchs collapse the economy whilst still retaining the control of the financial system , the food system , the health system etc\u2026 and of course the control of what is soon to become a very , very unhappy population ( you and me ) .\nThis is why they experimented on us \u2013 not only with the \u2018 vaccine , \u2019 but also with the vaccine mandate , aka \u201c Green Pass \u201d or \u201c le Pass Sanitaire \u201d to corral us all into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be required in the years to come \u2013 to eat , work , travel , vote\u2026the list is endless .\nSuch an exercise involves the removal of a nation \u2019 s sovereignty said Harley Schlanger , which would explain why transnational government and their networks no longer act in the best interest of our nations but in the interest of their new rules-based order .\nDeregulation of stock markets , bond markets , and the energy markets \u2013 is all part of the controlled disintegration recipe and will be imposed until we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or food , or to simply keeping our home .\nThey clearly have been working on this for a very long-time , as they knew one mistake along the way could be fatal to them .\nIt seems that they have already made a few .\nStill , we must keep on exposing this gigantic fraud , and know that they eventually will fall ; I believe the world has awakened quicker than they originally thought which has forced \u201c Mr Global \u201d to accelerate its agenda \u2019 s momentum .\nThe good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of scenario always implies mistakes , so keep your eyes peeled , and be ready to hold them to account .\nIt would be naive to believe that all this time the petrodollars were reinjected into the economy , as such revenues represent the source from which the banks have drawn most of their wealth and power .\nUnder \u2018 Volker rules \u2019 we saw deindustrialization and globalization in action , where family farms were transformed into food and agriculture cartel , not to mention the attack on US manufactures and the associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to China , South America and other cheap labour locations around the world .\nThis was also the birth of the outsourcing era pointed out Harley in his video , and in many ways it was a massive reconsolidation of wealth and power \u2013 which his all too common in the wake of a big boom-bust cycle .\nFrom the 1980 \u2019 s onward , we gradually saw the birth of the new \u2018 green \u2019 movement where ecology became politicised in order to bring into the controlled disintegration framework , with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d and \u201c stopping weapons of mass destruction \u201d whose blueprints can be found in Klaus Schwab \u2019 s mentor Henry Kissinger \u2019 s 1974 National Security Study Memorandum 200 ( The Kissinger Report ) .\nThis seminal report was declassified in 1980 and revealed for the first time in history that population growth in the Third World was identified as a \u201c national security threat \u201d and that measures to reduce birth rate and increase death rate was being seriously entertained .\nAfter just over 40 years , I believe we too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target of this agenda .\nWhat should we expect ?\nAnd what should be our response ?\nNow we are living in the \u2018 climate change \u2019 era , where a One Health approach justify government \u2018 public health \u2019 actions and other unprecedented moves against their populations , where new alleged vector-born diseases are deemed to be the direct result of things like global warming , and not a natural occurrence , or worse , conjured up by useless PCR data .\nThe globalists insist that all of these problems are man-made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is our excessive CO2 emissions that are somehow creating pandemics and environmental catastrophes that affect food supply .\nThanks to computer modeling they are able to creates impressive charts and predictive models to justify any state of emergency for health or for the environment .\nAnd today \u2019 s energy sector is no exception , it must be torn down as apparently our means for generating energy is simply not sustainable , and therefore the EU \u2019 s Green New Deal must apply .\nFunny , I always thought nuclear was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who would \u2019 ve ever imagined that a Cow \u2019 s fart and Cow \u2019 s feces will be at the centre of the new zero carbon related policies .\nThis is how neo liberal policies play a part in the control disintegration of our industries and our energy , food and agriculture systems not to become more efficient or environmental friendly , but simply to be brought under their exclusive control .\nThe Rockefeller Foundation and the Bill Gates of the world want it all , and they are prepared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faster \u201d .\nThe party \u2019 s over , and the global oligarchs are reconsolidating their wealth and power .\nOn the 25th of September , Rungis , the second-largest wholesale food market in the world after La Central de Abastos , located in Mexico City , mysteriously caught fire , perhaps accidentally , or perhaps on purpose , depending on your set of believes\u2026 however , must we all think this is a coincidence ?\nNow is the time for us French to familiarise ourselves with the \u201c Ecowatt system \u201d , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( R\u00e9seau de transport d \u2019 \u00e9lectricit\u00e9 ) which will provide the \u2018 weather forecast \u2019 for electricity .\nThe Ecowatt system , will allow users to see in real time the level of electricity available in the country thanks to a signal in a three color \u2018 traffic light \u2019 system : green ( normal ) , orange ( tense ) , and red ( very tense , synonymous with unavoidable blackouts if nothing is done to reduce consumption .\nI guess this will familiarise us all with the Chinese social credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we the people will be metered by the state real time .\nElectricity is now akin to the weather , and like a demigod the state controls that weather .\nClimate lockdowns , anyone ?\nI truly can \u2019 t think of a better way to spend winter\u2026 Make no mistake about it .\nThis is really about social engineering , and more broadly , depopulation , because if the cold doesn \u2019 t get the best of your grandparents this winter , or next the side effects of experimental pharmaceutical products mandated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our elders , our nurses , and our military , and of course on our kids \u2013 will do the job they were designed for .\nMany may soon will start to feel the pain of hunger too , as slowly the food we all like to eat will slowly disappear from our favourite shelves , whilst the mainstream media will keep on pointing the finger at Vladimir Putin ( until such time their fingers start to point at Volodymyr Zelenskyy ) .\nNon-aligned countries will feel the wrath of these neoliberals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they are ready to maim and kill for it unless we stand together as people .\nThe question is : will you fight on your knees or will you stand tall , proud and determined to defend who and what you love the most .\nNeo liberals fear the very nature of humankind , they fear the time when enough of us have realised that we are the ultimate target of their controlled disintegration , a time when disobedience and rebellion will grow so fast that it will be very hard for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for freedom and justice .\nWhat they fear the most is our ability to draw lessons from the past and our ability to swiftly react by reverting to our traditional and good way of life , grounded in common sense \u2013 taking the best of the old economic system and making the necessary changes to ensure that money and credit is going towards real production and not parasitic speculation .\nThey are vulnerable too , and our growing emancipation away for their proposed authoritarian regime and their digital currency can only weaken them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course play a part of what would become a reformed economic model , and it will be the role of the new policymakers of the world to ensure that all red tapes are in the right places and that no one , no group , no companies , no artificial intelligence software , nor any policies are in a position to dictate or control the future of mankind and the validity of our god given human rights .\nOur reset implies that free nations return to their original sovereign form and turn away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their control disintegration agenda that creates more austerity policies through endless cycles of war , regime change and genocide .\nWe now have an advantage , we know where the young leaders and the so-called masters of the World Economic Forum want to take us .\nI don \u2019 t know about you , but the future they have in store for us doesn \u2019 t feel very appealing .\nMany feel that we too have been given a chance to look straight into the abyss and the evil plan of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too needed to confront this reality \u2013 to realise that a tiny minority of the human race have been empowering and enriching themselves for a very , very long time , gradually working on their \u2018 green \u2019 depopulation agenda whilst planning to enslave us all .\nThey have gotten away with it so far , but their window of opportunity is closing faster they had anticipated , that is the price they are paying for making mistakes , or betting on the wrong horses .\nSo the time for pushback is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why they did it , to How can we overcome this .", "author": "LFC NEWS", "url":

FBI agents , including a retired deputy assistant director , head of counterterrorism and five SWAT team members , have spoken out publicly in support of suspended FBI whistleblower Stephen Friend .\nTheir heartfelt messages , obtained exclusively by The Post , show a deep and widespread anguish about the politicization of the FBI .\n\u201c It \u2019 s time to stop the FBI from being the enforcer of a political party \u2019 s ideology , \u201d says Ernie Tibaldi , a retired agent from San Francisco .\n\u201c We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apolitical and independent law enforcement entity that it always was.\n\u201d He expressed gratitude to Friend \u201c for having the courage to stand up to the corruption that has taken over the leadership of the FBI.\n\u201d Many former agents hailed Friend , a SWAT team member in Florida , as a \u201c hero \u201d after he was punished for refusing to participate in what he regarded as unnecessarily heavy-handed SWAT raids over Jan. 6 misdemeanors .\nIn his whistleblower complaint to the Department of Justice inspector general , Friend alleged that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to falsely inflate the threat of domestic terrorism , and using unconstitutional excessive force against political dissenters .\nTerry Turchie , former deputy assistant director of the FBI \u2019 s Counterterrorism Division , describes Friend as \u201c a model example of what FBI agents nationwide should be.\n\u201d \u201c Moral courage , leadership in the face of pressure , and true to the Oath of Office FBI agents take to defend the United States Constitution and protect America and its citizens .\n\u201c I am beyond proud to offer him my support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Turchie , who led the Unabomber task force , says he didn \u2019 t even use a SWAT team in 1996 to arrest Theodore Kaczynski , a violent domestic terrorist who had killed three people and injured 23 others .\n\u201c No real FBI agent would defend the position of using SWAT teams to arrest non-violent senior citizens and others with political opinions not currently tolerated by this administration , compounded by the idea that many of these cases involve misdemeanor criminal charges .\n\u201c This activity actually generates tension in communities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and injuries to FBI agents and citizens.\n\u201d Five former SWAT team members in Friend \u2019 s support group agree that raiding a nonviolent person on a misdemeanor offense was wrong and potentially dangerous .\n\u201c I was involved in numerous arrests where we never used any SWAT teams , \u201d says retired Special Agent David Baldovin , who served from 1969 to 2000 , including 25 years in SWAT .\n\u201c The current use \u2014 or should I say abuse \u2014 of bureau SWAT teams has been outrageous.\n\u201d Baldovin expressed thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say \u2018 hell , no \u2019 to the current bunch of FBI bureaucrats and tyrants.\n\u201d \u201c They do not exemplify Fidelity , Bravery and Integrity , but you , sir , certainly do \u2026 \u201c The SWAT colleagues of yours who agree to participate in these police state tactics are doing the same thing as those in Germany who participated in war crimes .\n\u2018 Only following orders , \u2019 right ?\n\u201d Another SWAT member , retired Special Agent Bob Fricke , who served from 1987 to 2008 , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using extreme SWAT tactics on elderly and other citizens who pose no physical threat , it makes me sick .\nIt has to be purely political\u2026 Continue this story at the NY Post PLEASE HELP SUPPORT OUR

the \u201c colonial \u201d West .\nCitizens of Russia , citizens of the Donetsk and Lugansk people \u2019 s republics , residents of the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions , deputies of the State Duma , senators of the Russian Federation , As you know , referendums have been held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s republics and the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions .\nThe ballots have been counted and the results have been announced .\nThe people have made their unequivocal choice .\nToday we will sign treaties on the accession of the Donetsk People \u2019 s Republic , Lugansk People \u2019 s Republic , Zaporozhye Region and Kherson Region to the Russian Federation .\nI have no doubt that the Federal Assembly will support the constitutional laws on the accession to Russia and the establishment of four new regions , our new constituent entities of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will of millions of people .\nIt is undoubtedly their right , an inherent right sealed in Article 1 of the UN Charter , which directly states the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples .\nI repeat , it is an inherent right of the people .\nIt is based on our historical affinity , and it is that right that led generations of our predecessors , those who built and defended Russia for centuries since the period of Ancient Rus , to victory .\nHere in Novorossiya , [ Pyotr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and [ Fyodor ] Ushakov fought their battles , and Catherine the Great and [ Grigory ] Potyomkin founded new cities .\nOur grandfathers and great-grandfathers fought here to the bitter end during the Great Patriotic War .\nWe will always remember the heroes of the Russian Spring , those who refused to accept the neo-Nazi coup d \u2019 \u00e9tat in Ukraine in 2014 , all those who died for the right to speak their native language , to preserve their culture , traditions and religion , and for the very right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donbass , the martyrs of the \u201c Odessa Khatyn , \u201d the victims of inhuman terrorist attacks carried out by the Kiev regime .\nWe commemorate volunteers and militiamen , civilians , children , women , senior citizens , Russians , Ukrainians , people of various nationalities ; popular leader of Donetsk Alexander Zakharchenko ; military commanders Arsen Pavlov and Vladimir Zhoga , Olga Kochura and Alexei Mozgovoy ; prosecutor of the Lugansk Republic Sergei Gorenko ; paratrooper Nurmagomed Gadzhimagomedov and all our soldiers and officers who died a hero \u2019 s death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are heroes .\nHeroes of great Russia .\nPlease join me in a minute of silence to honour their memory .\nBehind the choice of millions of residents in the Donetsk and Lugansk people \u2019 s republics , in the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions , is our common destiny and thousand-year history .\nPeople have passed this spiritual connection on to their children and grandchildren .\nDespite all the trials they endured , they carried the love for Russia through the years .\nThis is something no one can destroy .\nThat is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 those who were born after the tragic collapse of the Soviet Union \u2013 have voted for our unity , for our common future .\nIn 1991 in Belovezhskaya Pushcha , representatives of the party elite of that time made a decision to terminate the Soviet Union , without asking ordinary citizens what they wanted , and people suddenly found themselves cut off from their homeland .\nThis tore apart and dismembered our national community and triggered a national catastrophe .\nJust like the government quietly demarcated the borders of Soviet republics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution , the last leaders of the Soviet Union , contrary to the direct expression of the will of the majority of people in the referendum of 1991 , destroyed our great country , and simply made the people in the former republics face this as an accomplished fact .\nI can admit that they didn \u2019 t even know what they were doing and what consequences their actions would have in the end .\nBut it doesn \u2019 t matter now .\nThere is no Soviet Union anymore ; we can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia no longer needs it today ; this isn \u2019 t our ambition .\nBut there is nothing stronger than the determination of millions of people who , by their culture , religion , traditions , and language , consider themselves part of Russia , whose ancestors lived in a single country for centuries .\nThere is nothing stronger than their determination to return to their true historical homeland .\nFor eight long years , people in Donbass were subjected to genocide , shelling and blockades ; in Kherson and Zaporozhye , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Russia , for everything Russian .\nNow too , during the referendums , the Kiev regime threatened schoolteachers , women who worked in election commissions with reprisals and death .\nKiev threatened millions of people who came to express their will with repression .\nBut the people of Donbass , Zaporozhye and Kherson weren \u2019 t broken , and they had their say .\nI want the Kiev authorities and their true handlers in the West to hear me now , and I want everyone to remember this : the people living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Zaporozhye have become our citizens , forever .\nWe call on the Kiev regime to immediately cease fire and all hostilities ; to end the war it unleashed back in 2014 and return to the negotiating table .\nWe are ready for this , as we have said more than once .\nBut the choice of the people in Donetsk , Lugansk , Zaporozhye and Kherson will not be discussed .\nThe decision has been made , and Russia will not betray it .\nKiev \u2019 s current authorities should respect this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will ; there is no other way .\nThis is the only way to peace .\nWe will defend our land with all the forces and resources we have , and we will do everything we can to ensure the safety of our people .\nThis is the great liberating mission of our nation .\nWe will definitely rebuild the destroyed cities and towns , the residential buildings , schools , hospitals , theatres and museums .\nWe will restore and develop industrial enterprises , factories , infrastructure , as well as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education systems .\nWe will certainly work to improve the level of security .\nTogether we will make sure that citizens in the new regions can feel the support of all the people of Russia , of the entire nation , all the republics , territories and regions of our vast Motherland .\nToday I would like to address our soldiers and officers who are taking part in the special military operation , the fighters of Donbass and Novorossiya , those who went to military recruitment offices after receiving a call-up paper under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those who did this voluntarily , answering the call of their hearts .\nI would like to address their parents , wives and children , to tell them what our people are fighting for , what kind of enemy we are up against , and who is pushing the world into new wars and crises and deriving blood-stained benefits from this tragedy .\nOur compatriots , our brothers and sisters in Ukraine who are part of our united people have seen with their own eyes what the ruling class of the so-called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole .\nThey have dropped their masks and shown what they are really made of .\nWhen the Soviet Union collapsed , the West decided that the world and all of us would permanently accede to its dictates .\nIn 1991 , the West thought that Russia would never rise after such shocks and would fall to pieces on its own .\nThis almost happened .\nWe remember the horrible 1990s , hungry , cold and hopeless .\nBut Russia remained standing , came alive , grew stronger and occupied its rightful place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West continued and continues looking for another chance to strike a blow at us , to weaken and break up Russia , which they have always dreamed about , to divide our state and set our peoples against each other , and to condemn them to poverty and extinction .\nThey can not rest easy knowing that there is such a great country with this huge territory in the world , with its natural wealth , resources and people who can not and will not do someone else \u2019 s bidding .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to preserve the neo-colonial system which allows it to live off the world , to plunder it thanks to the domination of the dollar and technology , to collect an actual tribute from humanity , to extract its primary source of unearned prosperity , the rent paid to the hegemon .\nThe preservation of this annuity is their main , real and absolutely self-serving motivation .\nThis is why total de-sovereignisation is in their interest .\nThis explains their aggression towards independent states , traditional values and authentic cultures , their attempts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global currencies and technological development centres they can not control .\nIt is critically important for them to force all countries to surrender their sovereignty to the United States .\nIn certain countries , the ruling elites voluntarily agree to do this , voluntarily agree to become vassals ; others are bribed or intimidated .\nAnd if this does not work , they destroy entire states , leaving behind humanitarian disasters , devastation , ruins , millions of wrecked and mangled human lives , terrorist enclaves , social disaster zones , protectorates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t care .\nAll they care about is their own benefit .\nI want to underscore again that their insatiability and determination to preserve their unfettered dominance are the real causes of the hybrid war that the collective West is waging against Russia .\nThey do not want us to be free ; they want us to be a colony .\nThey do not want equal cooperation ; they want to loot .\nThey do not want to see us a free society , but a mass of soulless slaves .\nThey see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct threat .\nThat is why they target our philosophers for assassination .\nOur culture and art present a danger to them , so they are trying to ban them .\nOur development and prosperity are also a threat to them because competition is growing .\nThey do not want or need Russia , but we do .\nI would like to remind you that in the past , ambitions of world domination have repeatedly shattered against the courage and resilience of our people .\nRussia will always be Russia .\nWe will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Motherland .\nThe West is counting on impunity , on being able to get away with anything .\nAs a matter of fact , this was actually the case until recently .\nStrategic security agreements have been trashed ; agreements reached at the highest political level have been declared tall tales ; firm promises not to expand NATO to the east gave way to dirty deception as soon as our former leaders bought into them ; missile defence , intermediate-range and shorter-range missile treaties have been unilaterally dismantled under far-fetched pretexts .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is insisting on a rules-based order .\nWhere did that come from anyway ?\nWho has ever seen these rules ?\nWho agreed or approved them ?\nListen , this is just a lot of nonsense , utter deceit , double standards , or even triple standards !\nThey must think we \u2019 re stupid .\nRussia is a great thousand-year-old power , a whole civilisation , and it is not going to live by such makeshift , false rules .\nIt was the so-called West that trampled on the principle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is deciding , at its own discretion , who has the right to self-determination and who does not , who is unworthy of it .\nIt is unclear what their decisions are based on or who gave them the right to decide in the first place .\nThey just assumed it .\nThat is why the choice of the people in Crimea , Sevastopol , Donetsk , Lugansk , Zaporozhye and Kherson makes them so furiously angry .\nThe West does not have any moral right to weigh in , or even utter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It does not and it never did .\nWestern elites not only deny national sovereignty and international law .\nTheir hegemony has pronounced features of totalitarianism , despotism and apartheid .\nThey brazenly divide the world into their vassals \u2013 the so-called civilised countries \u2013 and all the rest , who , according to the designs of today \u2019 s Western racists , should be added to the list of barbarians and savages .\nFalse labels like \u201c rogue country \u201d or \u201c authoritarian regime \u201d are already available , and are used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is nothing new .\nThere is nothing new in this : deep down , the Western elites have remained the same colonisers .\nThey discriminate and divide peoples into the top tier and the rest .\nWe have never agreed to and will never agree to such political nationalism and racism .\nWhat else , if not racism , is the Russophobia being spread around the world ?\nWhat , if not racism , is the West \u2019 s dogmatic conviction that its civilisation and neoliberal culture is an indisputable model for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You \u2019 re either with us or against us.\n\u201d It even sounds strange .\nWestern elites are even shifting repentance for their own historical crimes on everyone else , demanding that the citizens of their countries and other peoples confess to things they have nothing to do with at all , for example , the period of colonial conquests .\nIt is worth reminding the West that it began its colonial policy back in the Middle Ages , followed by the worldwide slave trade , the genocide of Indian tribes in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the wars of England and France against China , as a result of which it was forced to open its ports to the opium trade .\nWhat they did was get entire nations hooked on drugs and purposefully exterminated entire ethnic groups for the sake of grabbing land and resources , hunting people like animals .\nThis is contrary to human nature , truth , freedom and justice .\nWhile we \u2013 we are proud that in the 20th century our country led the anti-colonial movement , which opened up opportunities for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress , reduce poverty and inequality , and defeat hunger and disease .\nTo emphasise , one of the reasons for the centuries-old Russophobia , the Western elites \u2019 unconcealed animosity toward Russia is precisely the fact that we did not allow them to rob us during the period of colonial conquests and forced the Europeans to trade with us on mutually beneficial terms .\nThis was achieved by creating a strong centralised state in Russia , which grew and got stronger based on the great moral values\u200b\u200b of Orthodox Christianity , Islam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Russian culture and the Russian word that were open to all .\nThere were numerous plans to invade Russia .\nSuch attempts were made during the Time of Troubles in the 17th century and in the period of ordeals after the 1917 revolution .\nAll of them failed .\nThe West managed to grab hold of Russia \u2019 s wealth only in the late 20th century , when the state had been destroyed .\nThey called us friends and partners , but they treated us like a colony , using various schemes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country .\nWe remember .\nWe have not forgotten anything .\nA few days ago , people in Donetsk and Lugansk , Kherson and Zaporozhye declared their support for restoring our historical unity .\nThank you !\nWestern countries have been saying for centuries that they bring freedom and democracy to other nations .\nNothing could be further from the truth .\nInstead of bringing democracy they suppressed and exploited , and instead of giving freedom they enslaved and oppressed .\nThe unipolar world is inherently anti-democratic and unfree ; it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The United States is the only country in the world that has used nuclear weapons twice , destroying the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan .\nAnd they created a precedent .\nRecall that during WWII the United States and Britain reduced Dresden , Hamburg , Cologne and many other German cities to rubble , without the least military necessity .\nIt was done ostentatiously and , to repeat , without any military necessity .\nThey had only one goal , as with the nuclear bombing of Japanese cities : to intimidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world .\nThe United States left a deep scar in the memory of the people of Korea and Vietnam with their carpet bombings and use of napalm and chemical weapons .\nIt actually continues to occupy Germany , Japan , the Republic of Korea and other countries , which they cynically refer to as equals and allies .\nLook now , what kind of alliance is that ?\nThe whole world knows that the top officials in these countries are being spied on and that their offices and homes are bugged .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who do this and for those who , like slaves , silently and meekly swallow this arrogant behaviour .\nThey call the orders and threats they make to their vassals Euro-Atlantic solidarity , and the creation of biological weapons and the use of human test subjects , including in Ukraine , noble medical research .\nIt is their destructive policies , wars and plunder that have unleashed today \u2019 s massive wave of migrants .\nMillions of people endure hardships and humiliation or die by the thousands trying to reach Europe .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhere are they taking it under the guise of ensuring the food security of the poorest countries ?\nWhere is it going ?\nThey are taking it to the self-same European countries .\nOnly five percent has been delivered to the poorest countries .\nMore cheating and naked deception again .\nIn effect , the American elite is using the tragedy of these people to weaken its rivals , to destroy nation states .\nThis goes for Europe and for the identities of France , Italy , Spain and other countries with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more sanctions against Russia and the majority of European politicians obediently go along with it .\nThey clearly understand that by pressuring the EU to completely give up Russian energy and other resources , the United States is practically pushing Europe toward deindustrialisation in a bid to get its hands on the entire European market .\nThese European elites understand everything \u2013 they do , but they prefer to serve the interests of others .\nThis is no longer servility but direct betrayal of their own peoples .\nGod bless , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe sanctions are no longer enough and now they have turned to subversion .\nIt seems incredible , but it is a fact \u2013 by causing explosions on Nord Stream \u2019 s international gas pipelines passing along the bottom of the Baltic Sea , they have actually embarked on the destruction of Europe \u2019 s entire energy infrastructure .\nIt is clear to everyone who stands to gain .\nThose who benefit are responsible , of course .\nThe dictates of the US are backed up by crude force , on the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautifully wrapped sometimes there is no wrapping at all but the gist is the same \u2013 the law of the fist .\nHence , the deployment and maintenance of hundreds of military bases in all corners of the world , NATO expansion , and attempts to cobble together new military alliances , such as AUKUS and the like .\nMuch is being done to create a Washington-Seoul-Tokyo military-political chain .\nAll states that possess or aspire to genuine strategic sovereignty and are capable of challenging Western hegemony , are automatically declared enemies .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and NATO military doctrines that require total domination .\nWestern elites are presenting their neocolonialist plans with the same hypocrisy , claiming peaceful intentions , talking about some kind of deterrence .\nThis evasive word migrates from one strategy to another but really only means one thing \u2013 undermining any and all sovereign centres of power .\nWe have already heard about the deterrence of Russia , China and Iran .\nI believe next in line are other countries of Asia , Latin America , Africa and the Middle East , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After all , we know that when they are displeased , they introduce sanctions against their allies as well \u2013 against this or that bank or company .\nThis is their practice and they will expand it .\nThey have everything in their sights , including our next-door neighbours \u2013 the CIS countries .\nAt the same time , the West has clearly been engaged in wishful thinking for a long time .\nIn launching the sanctions blitzkrieg against Russia , for example , they thought that they could once again line up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As it turns out , however , such a bright prospect does not excite everyone \u2013 other than complete political masochists and admirers of other unconventional forms of international relations .\nMost states refuse to \u201d snap a salute \u201c and instead choose the sensible path of cooperation with Russia .\nThe West clearly did not expect such insubordination .\nThey simply got used to acting according to a template , to grab whatever they please , by blackmail , bribery , intimidation , and convinced themselves that these methods would work forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past .\nSuch self-confidence is a direct product not only of the notorious concept of exceptionalism \u2013 although it never ceases to amaze \u2013 but also of the real \u201c information hunger \u201d in the West .\nThe truth has been drowned in an ocean of myths , illusions and fakes , using extremely aggressive propaganda , lying like Goebbels .\nThe more unbelievable the lie , the quicker people will believe it \u2013 that is how they operate , according to this principle .\nBut people can not be fed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t feed them with those pieces of paper , and the virtual , inflated capitalisation of western social media companies can \u2019 t heat their homes .\nEverything I am saying is important .\nAnd what I just said is no less so : you can \u2019 t feed anyone with paper \u2013 you need food ; and you can \u2019 t heat anyone \u2019 s home with these inflated capitalisations \u2013 you need energy .\nThat is why politicians in Europe have to convince their fellow citizens to eat less , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmer at home .\nAnd those who start asking fair questions like \u201c Why is that , in fact ?\n\u201d are immediately declared enemies , extremists and radicals .\nThey point back at Russia and say : that is the source of all your troubles .\nMore lies .\nI want to make special note of the fact that there is every reason to believe that the Western elites are not going to look for constructive ways out of the global food and energy crisis that they and they alone are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their long-term policy , dating back long before our special military operation in Ukraine , in Donbass .\nThey have no intention of solving the problems of injustice and inequality .\nI am afraid they would rather use other formulas they are more comfortable with .\nAnd here it is important to recall that the West bailed itself out of its early 20th century challenges with World War I .\nProfits from World War II helped the United States finally overcome the Great Depression and become the largest economy in the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of the dollar as a global reserve currency .\nAnd the 1980s crisis \u2013 things came to a head in the 1980s again \u2013 the West emerged from it unscathed largely by appropriating the inheritance and resources of the collapsed and defunct Soviet Union .\nThat \u2019 s a fact .\nNow , in order to free itself from the latest web of challenges , they need to dismantle Russia as well as other states that choose a sovereign path of development , at all costs , to be able to further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to patch their own holes .\nIf this does not happen , I can not rule out that they will try to trigger a collapse of the entire system , and blame everything on that , or , God forbid , decide to use the old formula of economic growth through war .\nRussia is aware of its responsibility to the international community and will make every effort to ensure that cooler heads prevail .\nThe current neocolonial model is ultimately doomed ; this much is obvious .\nBut I repeat that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the end .\nThey simply have nothing to offer the world except to maintain the same system of plundering and racketeering .\nThey do not give a damn about the natural right of billions of people , the majority of humanity , to freedom and justice , the right to determine their own future .\nThey have already moved on to the radical denial of moral , religious , and family values .\nLet \u2019 s answer some very simple questions for ourselves .\nNow I would like to return to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all citizens of the country \u2013 not just the colleagues that are in the hall \u2013 but all citizens of Russia : do we want to have here , in our country , in Russia , \u201c parent number one , parent number two and parent number three \u201d ( they have completely lost it ! )\ninstead of mother and father ?\nDo we want our schools to impose on our children , from their earliest days in school , perversions that lead to degradation and extinction ?\nDo we want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain other genders exist along with women and men and to offer them gender reassignment surgery ?\nIs that what we want for our country and our children ?\nThis is all unacceptable to us .\nWe have a different future of our own .\nLet me repeat that the dictatorship of the Western elites targets all societies , including the citizens of Western countries themselves .\nThis is a challenge to all .\nThis complete renunciation of what it means to be human , the overthrow of faith and traditional values , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to resemble a \u201c religion in reverse \u201d \u2013 pure Satanism .\nExposing false messiahs , Jesus Christ said in the Sermon on the Mount : \u201c By their fruits ye shall know them.\n\u201d These poisonous fruits are already obvious to people , and not only in our country but also in all countries , including many people in the West itself .\nThe world has entered a period of a fundamental , revolutionary transformation .\nNew centres of power are emerging .\nThey represent the majority \u2013 the majority !\n\u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready not only to declare their interests but also to protect them .\nThey see in multipolarity an opportunity to strengthen their sovereignty , which means gaining genuine freedom , historical prospects , and the right to their own independent , creative and distinctive forms of development , to a harmonious process .\nAs I have already said , we have many like-minded people in Europe and the United States , and we feel and see their support .\nAn essentially emancipatory , anti-colonial movement against unipolar hegemony is taking shape in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power will only grow with time .\nIt is this force that will determine our future geopolitical reality .\nToday , we are fighting for a just and free path , first of all for ourselves , for Russia , in order to leave dictate and despotism in the past .\nI am convinced that countries and peoples understand that a policy based on the exceptionalism of whoever it may be and the suppression of other cultures and peoples is inherently criminal , and that we must close this shameful chapter .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd I repeat : things will never be the same .\nThe battlefield to which destiny and history have called us is a battlefield for our people , for the great historical Russia .\nFor the great historical Russia , for future generations , our children , grandchildren and great-grandchildren .\nWe must protect them against enslavement and monstrous experiments that are designed to cripple their minds and souls .\nToday , we are fighting so that it would never occur to anyone that Russia , our people , our language , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history .\nToday , we need a consolidated society , and this consolidation can only be based on sovereignty , freedom , creation , and justice .\nOur values \u200b\u200bare humanity , mercy and compassion .\nAnd I want to close with the words of a true patriot Ivan Ilyin : \u201c If I consider Russia my Motherland , that means that I love as a Russian , contemplate and think , sing and speak as a Russian ; that I believe in the spiritual strength of the Russian people .\nIts spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my destiny ; its suffering is my grief ; and its prosperity is my joy.\n\u201d Behind these words stands a glorious spiritual choice , which , for more than a thousand years of Russian statehood , was followed by many generations of our ancestors .\nToday , we are making this choice ; the

sense of the events that have unfolded since the gas leaks first appeared emanating from the Nord Stream 1 and 2 natural gas pipelines in the Danish straits .\nNever in living memory has the world been this close to a WWIII escalation .\nWhile most governments and experts agree this was an act of sabotage , how to identify those who did it is still an open question .\nFew questions come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacks have been carried out by the US or with its allies , including Israel ?\n\u2022 Is it possible that the culprits used a fully Autonomous Underwater Drone from French Naval Group with remote mines laying capacities ( see video at end of this article ) ?\n\u2022 Is this event comparable to 9/11 , concealed by a US-led military drill , as another major event endangering the world peace , security and stability ?\n\u2022 Why is Russia is using the term \u201c terrorism \u201d when referring to the Nord Stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Event 201 \u201d for this unprecedented attack on EU and Russian key strategic energy infrastructures ?\nOnce more we found ourselves contemplating how the mainstream media , in a well rehearsed dance , does its very best to strangle the free flow of information that could be vital to identifying the true culprits , as well as the potential beneficiaries .\nOf course , Hurricane Ian arrived just in time to engulf the entirety of media coverage and attention late last week , effectively killing off the Nordstream pipeline incident in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian self-inflicted wound narrative which only make sense to the neoliberals and those who do not grasp the concept that there is no need to blow-up you own pipelines when you can simply to turn off the tap , not to mention the billions of dollars revenue Russia would lose by engaging in an act of self-sabotage .\nSeismic stations of Sweden , Norway and Finland all reported the equivalent of two explosions on Monday near the site of the leaks and stated : \u201c We know very well what an underwater blast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , there \u2019 s no doubt this is not an earthquake , \u201d Bjorn Lund , a Swedish seismologist with Uppsala University said .\nQui bono ?\nWe certainly didn \u2019 t have to wait long before witnessing the first decoy media story with the announcement of the launch of the new Norway-Poland Baltic Pipeline which coincidentally opened the day after the underwater explosions , and which overnight makes Poland the new energy hub for Northern Europe .\nInauguration of the Baltic Pipeline that connects Poland to Norway via Denmark : Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to relax , as Biden and allies are sending their investigative teams who shouldn \u2019 t have much trouble finding the origin of the blasts .\nIt \u2019 s doubtful any of them will talk about the fact that NATO partners , including the US Navy SEALs , participated in the joint military exercise BALTOPS 22 in June 2022 , in the exact area of the Nordstream attacks .\nAs for the Russians , they seemed to have already made up their minds about who could be behind this sabotage , especially after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and MEP Radek Sikorski tweeted \u201c Thank you , USA \u201d .\nSikorski eventually removed his tweet , realizing that perhaps it wasn \u2019 t the smartest move , likely after getting non-stop phone call from the White House and Brussels .\nIn the fog of war , the wrong interpretation of such events could easily escalate the conflict to a new level hence the reason for not jumping to conclusion too quickly or without exploring all other possible avenues .\nLike any crimes or investigation , one must look at who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry out the attack , as well as which one of those who were in a position to benefit from the sabotage \u2013 rather than only focus on who is being blamed in the media , a competency which Reuters fact-checkers may find elusive , judging by what they wrote in their recent article on the topic ( no surprise here ) .\nPictured : Russian ambassador to the UN shows the offending tweet .\nThe EU and NATO \u2019 s eagerness to promote ridiculous conspiracy theories was to be expected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have blown its own pipelines in a \u2018 Red October \u2019 moment , as explained by the likes of the BBC .\nAs these events unfolded , this author was actually in the middle of an investigation looking into the worsening situation of BASF chemical and fertilizer plant in Ludwigshafen Germany near the Rhine river .\nAs we were looking into BASF \u2019 s nitrogen-based fertilisers using gas and air which are so vital to many industrial sectors across Europe , the sabotage of Nordstream 1 and 2 pipelines occurred , forcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Europe to start feeling the anticipated repercussions associated with voluntarily restricting its own gas supply in Europe .\nHowever , nothing is ever as it seems , especially when you know that Germany , the Netherlands , Italy and France all have access to emergency gas reserves in case of a shortage , but are intentionally refusing to open the gas tap available to them .\nThis has to be one of the best kept secret in Europe at the moment .\nAre we meant to believe that the Germans were waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security and dependency on Russian gas ?\nThis is laughable at best , and it \u2019 s surprising just how many still don \u2019 t understand how governments and international agencies working 24/7 on energy security measures ensuring the uninterrupted availability of energy sources at an affordable price all time .\nHave they all conspired to participate in this staged crisis , or is there more to this story ?\nMy last article covered the origin of the present international energy crisis and the CFR \u2019 s \u201c Project

familiar ?\nRather ironic that Joe Biden would be holding the first U.S. hunger summit in over 50 years .\nNow let us explore another route that may expose the people behind the propaganda machine which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , whilst tutting 24/7 with their vassal corrupt MSM about \u201c European dependence on Russian gas.\n\u201d These same preachers have been using the Ukraine-Russia conflict as a platform to establish the urgency for the EU to find alternatives to cheap and reliable Russian gas .\nWould another competing pipeline project into Europe be motivation enough to participate in the destruction of Russia \u2019 s Nordstream 1 and 2 ?\nIf so , who are the competitors , do they possess the means and opportunity to carry out such an act of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Jewish Journal entitled , \u201c Instead of Relying on Rogue States like Russia for Energy , the West Should Look to Israel and its Democratic Partners , \u201d authored by Ambassador Dore Gold , the President of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs who served as the Director-General of Israel \u2019 s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and as Israel \u2019 s Ambassador to the United Nations , he states , \u201c Whether it \u2019 s reducing Western dependence on Russian gas or Iranian oil , the West is way overdue for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a precious few countries , chief among them Israel , have been quietly pushing , if not lobbying the United States and the EU \u2013 to destabilise the two centers of gravity for energy production , which are Russia and Iran .\nHe adds : \u201c In the case of Russia , the European dependence on Russian gas has undermined the West \u2019 s ability to isolate Vladimir Putin for his savage invasion of Ukraine .\nIn the case of Iran , under the guise of a flawed nuclear deal , the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world \u2019 s # 1 sponsor of terror and a major oil producer.\n\u201d Such a statement demonstrates unequivocally that Israel and its Mediterranean partners have a preferred option they would like the EU to entertain , albeit with the blessing of the United States .\nSuch option began to emerge in 2009 , with the discovery of immense reserves of natural gas off Israel \u2019 s coast , with a potential of some 381 trillion cubic feet of gas or roughly 5 percent of the world \u2019 s gas reserves .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas field with 18 trillion cubic feet of gas , a team of MIT geologists concluded that there were six more Leviathans within Israel \u2019 s territorial waters.\n\u201d Thus , a new plan for the Mediterranean gas route was born , and it included an extension known as the EastMed pipeline from Greece to Cyprus , and connected to the Southern Italy via the Poseidon Pipeline .\nThis way was Israel \u2019 s original plan to bring gas on to the European shores : In 2020 , Israel , Cyprus and Greece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertake this game changing EastMed Pipeline with a completion date in 2025 , to begin the export of Eastern Mediterranean gas to European markets ( Reuters ) .\n.\nAlthough American energy giant , Chevron ( formerly Standard Oil of California ) stepped up and completed its acquisition of Noble Energy in October 2020 , and the fact the project attracted \u20ac34.5 million in EU funding to support front end engineering design studies \u2013 the Biden administration still withdrew its support for the pipeline in January 2022 .\nTo better understand the Energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the EASTMED Gas Pipeline Project in February 2022 , I invite you to review the following document from the Atlantic Council : .\nWhen U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made the significant decision to travel to Israel to meet with the three countries and express support from the Trump White House for the Jewish state \u2019 s energy cooperation with Greece and Cyprus , the U.S. became involved ( the + 1 in the negotiations between the three Mediterranean countries ) in March 2019 .\nSo if USA Inc was on board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdraw its support for the project ?\nWell , it \u2019 s no secret that Turkish President Erdogan recognised at the time a self-interest for Turkey in taking advantage of the significant energy resources , particularly gas , in the Eastern Mediterranean , as reported in this The National News article titled , \u201c From on to off : Why Biden went cold on the Mediterranean gas pipeline from Israel.\n\u201d However , Erdogan soon found himself excluded from the EASTMED Pipeline deal , and quickly responded by signing an agreement with western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasised Turkish claims over a large bulk of Eastern Mediterranean waters , \u201c in part to push back against the proposed pipeline.\n\u201d Soon after the tension in the Eastern Mediterranean boiled over during the Trump administration , with Turkish war vessels accompanying its drill ships near Cyprus .\nAt the same time , the World Bank-funded gas pipeline from Egypt through Jordan and Syria and into Lebanon , a deal backed by the Biden administration despite the fact that technically Lebanon and Israel remain at war states a Bryan Harris February article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , \u201c Israelis had also expressed interest in exporting natural gas to Lebanon via Jordan and then into Syria \u201d , an effort apparently mediated by US diplomat and coordinator for International Energy Affairs Amos Hochstein .\nHere is a video of Hochstein explaining how the Biden Administration can support the gas pipeline project without violating the U.S. sanctions , especially those authorized by the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2019 .\nLBCI Interview with Senior Advisor for Global Energy Security Amos Hochstein ( Source : US Embassy in Lebanon ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumped to Lebanon through the Arab pipeline , which stretches from Egypt , Jordan and Syria , is mostly Israeli \u201d said this article on Ashrak Al-Awsat/ Furthermore , on January 2022 Time of Israel wrote that \u201c Israel is also said to secretly ink unprecedented deal to supply gas to Lebanon , via Jordan \u201d , the claim was of course immediately refuted by Lebanese Minister of Energy , HE Walid Fayad .\nIn The Jerusalem Post July 2022 article titled \u201c Lebanon gas deal creates strangest of connections \u2019 one can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the pipelined gas that will be reaching the Deir Ammar power plant via the pipeline will be Israeli \u2013 extracted from Israel \u2019 s Leviathan gas field in the Eastern Mediterranean \u201d .\nThe subject is of course extremely sensitive , and we have no evidence of any secret deal , nor we are interested in supporting any side of the argument .\nNonetheless , Republicans on Capitol Hill had opposed the initiative on the grounds that it would conflict with a 2019 legislation imposing full sanctions on Syria , despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration .\n( source ) Did the Biden abandon this Israeli-led pipeline deal in favor of Russian gas via Ukraine ?\nWe are not the only one to think there is a strong possibility \u2013 see article from AmericanEnergyAlliance.org In January 2022 the US Reps questioned withdrawal of US support for EastMed pipeline from Israel .\nSo from this point of view , this EastMed has essentially stalled , for now .\nThis change in policy was perceived as \u201c hypocritical and offensive , \u201d because of \u201c the Biden administration \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 pipeline , and the US announcement on 20 May 2021 to waive sanctions on Nordstream 2 which would take gas from the Russia under the Baltic Sea to Germany and was already more than 95 % complete .\nOn May 19 , 2021 , despite a U.S. government sanctions report to Congress , describing how \u2018 NS2AG and Mr. Matthias Warnig knowingly facilitated transactions to provide the pipe-laying vessel Fortuna for the construction of NS2 , \u2019 Joe Biden still determined it was in the national interests of the United States to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and NS2AG corporate officers .\nJust two months later , in July 2021 , U.S. joined with Germany to issue the Joint Statement of the United States and Germany on Support for Ukraine , followed by the immediate cancelation of the waiver , and the rest is history\u2026 What could have possibly triggered Biden sudden change of mind ?\nWell , if you remember , it was in June 2021 that journalist Jack Maxey brought to the Washington Post a copy of the hard drive from the computer that his son Hunter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April 2019 .\nCould the contents have been ugly enough to convince Biden to abandon he and his son \u2019 s dodgy deals in Ukraine and Russia ?\nWe are only speculating here , but it \u2019 s a question worth asking .\nThe U.S. withdrew financing for the \u20ac6 billion EASTMED pipeline , a 1,250-kilometer route that was intended to transport offshore gas from Israel and Egypt to the EU market .\n\u201c As a result , the project was effectively dead , \u201d concluded the National News article .\nA game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears to be a pivotal day especially as it coincided with the National Security Briefing known as the Benjamin Gettler Annual International Policy Trip .\nThe Benjamin Gettler International Policy Trip annually brings high-level delegations of retired senior military officers and civilian national security experts to a country that is important to U.S. national security and/or the U.S.-Israel \u2018 special relationship.\n\u2019 After completing their trip , each group then shares their findings and recommendations with policymakers and opinion leaders in Washington , D.C. and across the U.S .\nThe meeting focused on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mediterranean can help reduce the dependence of America \u2019 s European allies on Russian energy , as well as \u2018 how several U.S. partners in the Eastern Mediterranean have accelerated their long-standing efforts to boost energy cooperation \u2018 and grow their gas exports .\nNote that on June 15 , the European Union ( EU ) finalised a deal with Israel and Egypt to increase Israeli natural gas deliveries to Egypt which will be converted to liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) for transport to European terminals ( with the potential for involvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The document goes even further compelling the \u2018 U.S .\nto work assiduously to help create a southern gas corridor for Europe , \u2019

Most of His Plans Still a Mystery", "content": "SAN FRANCISCO ( AP ) \u2014 A super app called X ?\nA bot-free free speech haven ?\nThese are some of Elon Musk \u2019 s mysterious plans for Twitter , now that he may be buying the company after all .\nAfter months of squabbling over the fate of their bombshell $ 44 billion deal , the billionaire and the bird app are essentially back to square one \u2014 if a bit worse for wear as trust and goodwill has seemed to erode on both sides .\nMusk , the CEO of Tesla Motors and SpaceX and Twitter \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donald Trump was booted from it , has shared few concrete details about his plans for the social media platform .\nWhile he \u2019 s touted free speech and derided spam bots since agreeing to buy the company in April , what he actually wants to do about either is shrouded in mystery .\nHe could own one of the world \u2019 s most powerful communications platforms with 237 million daily users in a matter of weeks , though the deal is not final .\nThe lack of clear plans for the platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituencies , ranging from users in conflict regions where it offers an information lifeline to the company \u2019 s own employees .\n\u201c Both users and advertisers are \u2014 understandably \u2014 anxious about whether the move will fundamentally change the culture of the platform , \u201d said Brooke Erin Duffy , a professor at Cornell University who studies social media .\n\u201c And so , Musk will need to decide whether he wants to quash their concerns by retaining core features ( the content moderation system , for instance ) and keeping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertake a full-scale overhaul.\n\u201d Muddling things further , on Tuesday Musk tweeted that \u201c Buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X , the everything app , \u201d without further explanation .\nAlthough Musk \u2019 s tweets and statements have been cryptic , technology analysts have speculated that Musk wants to re-create a version of China \u2019 s WeChat app that can do video chats , messaging , streaming , scan bar codes and make payments .\nHe gave a little more detail during Tesla \u2019 s annual shareholder meeting in August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near Austin , Texas , that he uses Twitter frequently and knows the product well .\n\u201c I think I \u2019 ve got a good sense of where to point the engineering team with Twitter to make it radically better , \u201d he said .\nHandling payments for goods could be a key part of the app .\nMusk said he has a \u201c grander vision \u201d for what X.com , an online bank he started early in his career that eventually became part of PayPal , could have been .\n\u201c Obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I think Twitter would help accelerate that by three-to-five years , \u201d Musk said at the August meeting .\n\u201c So it \u2019 s kind of something that I thought would be quite useful for a long time .\nI know what to do.\n\u201d For now , Twitter has immediate and pressing problems Musk will need to deal with if he takes ownership of the company .\nIts social media rivals are struggling with declining stock prices and some , like Snap , even announced layoffs .\nGovernment regulation and attracting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenges .\nAnd Musk \u2019 s vision of a free speech haven has social media and content moderation experts , as well as digital and human rights advocates , concerned .\n\u201c When this all started in the spring , we had indicators and a strong sense of what Musk might do with the platform , \u201d said Angelo Carusone of Media Matters , a watchdog group that opposes the takeover .\n\u201c Because of the lawsuit , we know who he \u2019 s been talking to , what he \u2019 s been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision makers he wants to put in place .\nTo put it bluntly , the worst fears have been confirmed.\n\u201d Twitter employees , under former CEO Jack Dorsey and his predecessors , have spent years working to tame the platform once called the \u201c free-speech wing of the free-speech party \u201d where hate and harassment abound into something where all are welcome and safe .\nWhile it \u2019 s far from perfect , critics worry Musk \u2019 s ownership will mean turning back the clock on years of this work .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll back Twitter \u2019 s community standards and safety guidelines , reinstate Donald Trump along with scores of other accounts suspended for violence and abuse , and open the floodgates of disinformation , \u201d Carusone said .\nThe company , for instance , was an early adopter of the \u201c report abuse \u201d button in 2013 , after U.K. member of parliament Stella Creasy received a barrage of rape and death threats on the platform , echoing the experiences of other women over the years .\nIn subsequent years , Twitter continued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology to detect violent threats , harassment and misinformation that violates its policies .\nAfter evidence emerged that Russia used their platforms to try to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election , social media companies also stepped up their efforts against political misinformation .\nThe big question now is how far Musk , who describes himself as a \u201c free-speech absolutist , \u201d wants to ratchet back these systems \u2014 and whether users and advertisers will stick around if he does .\nAiming to tamp down such worries , Musk said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as broadly inclusive as possible \u201d where ideally , most of America is on it and talking \u2014 a far cry from the far-right playground his critics are warning against .\nAnd while Musk has hinted he \u2019 d consider reinstating Trump \u2019 s account , it \u2019 s not clear the former president , who has since launched his own social media platform , would return .\nThen there \u2019 s the matter of Twitter \u2019 s employees , who \u2019 ve been living with uncertainty , high- ( and low- ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s publicly derided them on their own platform .\nMusk has also targeted Twitter \u2019 s work-from home policy , having once called for the company \u2019 s headquarters to be turned into a \u201c homeless shelter \u201d because , he said , so few employees actually worked there .\nAs a hyper-frequent Twitter user with over 100 million followers , Musk does know how to use the platform .\nDuring an all-hands staff meeting Musk attended in June , he said his goal was to make it \u201c so compelling that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d If he \u2019 s able to realize this , it could finally put Twitter in the big leagues of social media , with TikTok and Meta \u2019 s Facebook and Instagram , where users are counted in the billions , not mere millions .\nOf course , Musk is also well known for predictions that are delayed or may not come true , such as colonizing Mars or deploying a fleet of autonomous robotaxis .\n\u201c This is not a car manufacturer where , good enough , all you have to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that isn \u2019 t really that hard , \u201d said David Kirsch , a professor of strategy and entrepreneurship at the University of Maryland who \u2019 s studied Twitter bots \u2019 effect on Tesla \u2019 s stock price .\n\u201c You are dealing here with all of these other companies ( that ) also have very sophisticated AI programs , very sophisticated PhD programmers\u2026everyone is trying to crack

agreement would mark a major breakthrough in relations between the two countries , which formally have been at war since Israel \u2019 s establishment in 1948 .\nBut the deal still faces some obstacles , including legal and political challenges in Israel .\nLebanese officials indicated they would approve the agreement .\nAt stake are rights over exploiting undersea natural gas reserves in

Prime Minister Yair Lapid called the deal a \u201c historic achievement that will strengthen Israel \u2019 s security , inject billions into Israel \u2019 s economy , and ensure the stability of our @

.\nLebanon has been working with the French energy giant Total on preparations for exploring the field .\nThe agreement would also leave in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serves as a de facto border between the

accept whatever lies they were told .\nThe aim , as we knew all along , was to reduce the size of the world \u2019 s population .\nThat \u2019 s what the conspirators frequently told us .\nAnd that is what they meant .\nThe covid-19 jab will kill many .\nAbandoning the elderly , the sick and the disabled will kill millions .\nThe growing famine in Asia and Africa will kill a billion or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast enough .\nA good , chronic , designer war will kill billions .\nIt is possible because the conspirators have suppressed the truth , demonised the truth-tellers and terrified millions into

have known did more harm than good ) and the bought-and-paid-for media ( bought with massive , taxpayer funded advertising which kept them alive ) supported and promoted the conspirators and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt it was patently clear that what was happening in Ukraine is being used as an excuse to build up enthusiasm for World War III .\nAnd since the beginning of what is best described as an Orwellian designer war , the conspirators have been working hard to push the collaborating public ( brains softened by too many months of mask wearing and too many toxic injections ) into demanding a war against Russia .\nThe UK Government \u2013 which has debts up to its collective eyeballs \u2013 is spending another \u00a325 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombs to Ukraine to make sure that the war continues and

Algeria, As Washington Plays Wicked Stepmother", "content": "For energy-starved EU , Algeria is no longer a metaphoric dependable girl next door .\nShe \u2019 s suddenly blossomed into a hottie who gets chased after by all her divorced former classmates at the high school reunion .\nJust a year ago French President Emmanuel Macron could hardly bother to give the former North African French colony the time of day .\nIt was mostly taken for granted that Algiers would keep pumping gas for the European Union as the bloc \u2019 s third largest natural gas supplier after Russia and Norway .\nMacron even accused the country \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c hatred towards France.\n\u201d He went as far as to ask , \u201c Was there an Algerian nation before French colonization ?\nThat \u2019 s the question.\n\u201d Sounds a lot like the rhetoric someone hears when they \u2019 re in an exploitative relationship , \u201c You were nothing before I came along and started taking advantage of you.\n\u201d But now that the EU is undergoing an acrimonious divorce from former natural gas main squeeze , Russia , its tune sure has changed .\nThis week , French Prime Minister Elizabeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministers for an \u201c economic cooperation \u201d trip .\nIncreased gas supplies for France were \u201c not on the table , \u201d according to her office .\nGuess she \u2019 s waiting until the third date , like a gentleman , before jumping all over Algeria \u2019 s gas .\nBut that moment could be coming up fast since the country \u2019 s first date with its new French charmers was with Macron himself just six weeks ago .\nHe didn \u2019 t mention gas at the time , but the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CEO of the Paris-headquartered energy multinational , Engie , hinted at his real interest .\nSimilarly , the EU energy commissioner was just expected to attend a conference in the country during the French delegation \u2019 s trip .\nOfficially , the French wooing of Algiers is all about reconciliation and making amends .\n\u201c Sorry , I ignored you and took advantage of your kindness earlier .\nHow about giving me a chance ?\nI \u2019 ve changed !\n\u201d Of course , Europe has indeed changed .\nIt \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to shake free some new gas supplies as its economy starts buckling under spiking energy prices , rationing , and blackout threats \u2014 and fall has barely even begun , let alone winter .\nFor an idea of just how bad things are , last week Borne held a press conference to introduce an \u201c energy sobriety \u201d plan for all sectors of French daily life , from businesses and sports to housing , industry , and public services .\n\u201c Sobriety is a simple concept : savings chosen rather than cuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Depending on our consumption and the weather , we will then know if we are progressing at the right pace and in the right direction.\n\u201d The government , like others across Europe , has already set heating and cooling limits .\nIn France , someone going over the 19 degree Celsius temperature for their home could theoretically risk a \u20ac1,500 fine under the French penal code , and \u20ac3,000 in the case of repeat offenders .\nBut unfortunately for Europe , Algiers has long maintained an officially nonaligned position and doesn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally and exclusively into the arms of Europe and the West , particularly now that it has other options to diversify its interests in an increasingly multipolar world .\nTo that end , it has strengthened bilateral cooperation with China and its historical ally Russia which helped it gain its independence from France .\nAnd it has every right to do so .\nFurther complicating France and the EU \u2019 s seduction efforts is its meddling stepmom , America , who doesn \u2019 t like that Algeria has ties with Russia and seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any deepening EU-Algerian relationship .\nTo that end , the US is now considering sanctioning Algeria for a $ 7 billion weapons deal with Moscow that was inked last year .\nSurely , it \u2019 s purely coincidental that it \u2019 s only now that Europe is increasingly showing up on Algeria \u2019 s doorstep with flowers that these sanctions threats are suddenly materializing .\n\u201c Any country continuing to support Russia as it relates to its conflict in Ukraine right now , its unjust and its unlawful infringement on Ukraine \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply problematic , \u201d said US State Department principal deputy spokesman , Vedant Patel , when asked to comment on a bipartisan letter demanding sanctions against Algerian government officials sent by members of Congress to Secretary of State Antony Blinken .\nAny such sanctions wouldn \u2019 t just hit Algeria .\nWherever the EU \u2019 s economic diversification away from US dependence goes , sanctions seem to follow .\nSuch was the case with Iran and the bloc \u2019 s gas supply from Russia through the new Nord Stream 2 pipeline , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time when some European leaders are starting to make noises suggesting that the US is taking advantage of the EU \u2019 s increased dependence on US natural gas in the wake of sanctioning its supply from Russia .\n\u201c Some countries , some of which are considered friends , partially charge astronomic prices , \u201d German economy minister , Robert Habeck said in an interview earlier this month .\n\u201c The US approached us when oil prices were high , leading to a release of national oil reserves also in Europe .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ also work well for lowering gas prices.\n\u201d Good luck with that begging as a strategy .\nUntil the EU stops letting Washington call the shots and meddle in its relationships , it \u2019 s never going to be able to find true happiness and prosperity \u2014 with Algeria or anyone else .\nThis story was originally published at RT International .\nPLEASE HELP SUPPORT OUR INDEPENDENT MEDIA PLATFORM HERE", "author": "NEWS

Arabia to beg the royal family to pump more oil in order help lower gasoline prices ahead of the upcoming US midterm elections , and a further rebuff to Washington by OPEC +1 , the Biden Administration has decided to lash out at the long-time ally of Washington \u2013 and threaten sanctions and other \u2018 tough \u2019 diplomatic measures .\nIronically , or not : President Biden is essentially doing what the Democrats impeached President Donald Trump for allegedly doing , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the national interest .\nIn Trump \u2019 s case , it was a phone call to Zelensky

by announcing its largest supply cut in years , no matter the desperate entreaties of the Biden administration .\nThe resulting fallout still smolders in Washington , where many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to humiliate President Biden and undermine his party \u2019 s prospects ahead of the upcoming midterm elections \u2014 on top of boosting the fossil fuel-subsidized war machine of Russian President

.\nIn a generation \u2019 s time our streets will be packed with geriatric , English beggars pleading to be given enough money to buy a little food.\n\u2019 And now we \u2019 re very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squabble between Truss \u2019 s apparently chaotic and spendthrift Government and the apparently incompetent Bank of England is setting us all up for a perfect financial Armageddon .\nThe Bank of

until they drop .\nAnd the Bank \u2019 s Governor is in Washington with the Chancellor .\nI \u2019 m sure they are having a wonderful time .\nMight I suggest that they stay there ?\nBritish pension funds are in a mess because of the twin policies of the Bank of England and the new Government .\nBut Bailey , who gets over half a million quid a year as Governor of the Bank ( and who can rightly claim to be the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem is the fault of the pension funds for doing what they are forced to do \u2013 hold Government bonds \u2013 and that they should sort out the mess .\nGilts (

what the advice is for those who manage their own pensions who , if they \u2019 ve been prudent , will have lost up to a third of their pension fund in a day .\nIt is clear that there is no place for self-reliance in the Great Reset .\nPutting aside some corn for the wet , difficult years is a waste of money .\nThe Government doesn \u2019 t want people to do that .\nThey want everyone to be dependent on them .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That \u2019 s why the Government is giving out money it hasn \u2019 t got in energy caps and massive contributions to businesses .\nThe Government doesn \u2019

Center for Renewing America has compiled a stunning dossier on the overt corruption being perpetrated by America \u2019 s increasingly partisan FBI\u2026 The FBI \u2019 s unprecedented raid on a former president \u2019 s residence is the most recent and stark example of the degree to which the federal law enforcement apparatus is being weaponized to protect the country \u2019 s political left and to attack its political right .\nThese actions reveal the need for serious action by Congress to protect the American people and restore self-government in this country .\nThis should include the creation of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s committee in the 1970s\u2014 to investigate the FBI and the other national security agencies that have participated in activities antithetical to a country that purports to be ruled by its citizens .\n\u2022 Russia Hoax : The FBI knowingly used false information , collectively known as the Steele Dossier , as a pretext for investigating a Republican candidate \u2019 s presidential campaign .\nThe dossier was produced by the rival Hillary Clinton campaign .\nFormer FBI attorney Kevin Clinesmith pled guilty to lying to the FISA court , which granted warrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u2022 Political Bias : FBI Agent Peter Strzok , a lead investigator into false allegations of collusion between Trump and Russia , famously sent a text to his FBI colleague , Lisa Page , saying the FBI \u201c will stop \u201d Trump from becoming president .\nBoth Strzok and Page were later discovered to have worked together to keep open the prosecution of Trump \u2019 s former national security advisor Michael Flynn , even after DOJ had dropped the case .\nTaxpayers are still funding Deputy Director Andrew McCabe \u2019 s legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian collusion narrative , pursued FISA warrants against the Trump campaign , and lied to investigators under oath , three times .\n\u2022 Entrapment : The FBI devised a fraudulent entrapment case against four citizens accused of a kidnapping plot against Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan .\nA jury acquitted two of the four men in April 2022 , after determining the FBI had entrapped and enticed the defendants to consider the action .\nInstead of being reprimanded , the head of the Detroit field office in charge was promoted to the prestigious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events , showing the extent to which the FBI \u2019 s culture is compromised .\n\u2022 Targeting School Board Parents : At the behest of the National School Board Association , the FBI began targeting concerned parents protesting Critical Race Theory and other divisive concepts as domestic terrorists .\nThe DOJ \u2019 s National Security Division , created in the wake of 9/11 , is involved in this effort .\nTo be clear , the National Security Division , intended to protect against foreign terrorists , is focused on concerned parents exercising their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2022 Using Law Enforcement to Protect President Biden \u2019 s Children : ( 1 ) FBI agents raided the private residence of journalist James O \u2019 Keefe allegedly searching for a missing diary belonging to President Biden \u2019 s daughter , and ( 2 ) despite video evidence of multiple federal felonies , protecting President Biden \u2019 s son from prosecution .\n\u2022 Ignoring Hillary Clinton \u2019 s Private Server : Secretary of State Hillary Clinton intentionally mishandled government documents\u2013including classified documents\u2013using a private server she had installed in her home in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out of government control , but the DOJ declined to prosecute and then-FBI Director Comey made the announcement of that declination\u2013completely contrary to proper protocol ( i.e.\n, prosecutors decide whether to prosecute [ DOJ ] , while law enforcement [ FBI ] merely investigates ) .\n\u2022 Refusing to Prosecute Pro-Abortion Extremism : There have been more than 80 firebombings and acts of vandalism against crisis pregnancy centers , pro-life women \u2019 s centers , and churches since the Dobbs decision was leaked to Politico from inside the Supreme Court .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts as domestic terrorism .\nThe FBI has forfeited the benefit of the doubt in the minds of millions of Americans .\nInstitutions require widespread public trust to maintain their legitimacy and yet the trajectory of public sentiment has rightfully been trending downward for years .\nThe Department of Justice under Attorney General Merrick Garland announced the indictment of pro-life activist Herb Geraghty on Oct. 14 , bringing the number of apparently nonviolent pro-life protesters targeted under the FACE ( Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances ) Act by President Joe Biden \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile , the agency has yet to announce a single arrest or indictment against any of the vandals or arsonists who terrorized and firebombed crisis pregnancy centers after the leak of the Supreme Court \u2019 s Dobbs v. Jackson decision overturning Roe v. Wade .\nGeraghty , a 25-year-old from Pittsburgh , is accused of participating in a \u201c reproductive health care clinic blockade in Washington , D.C. , on Oct. 22 , 2020.\n\u201d Along with nine other defendants , the DOJ alleges , Geraghty \u201c forcefully entered the [ abortion facility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors using their bodies , furniture , chains and ropes.\n\u201d In March , the FBI announced indictments against the other nine : \u201c Lauren Handy , 28 , of Alexandria , Virginia ; Jonathan Darnel , 40 , of Arlington , Virginia , Jay Smith , 32 , of Freeport , New York ; Paulette Harlow , 73 , of Kingston , Massachusetts ; Jean Marshall , 72 , of Kingston , Massachusetts ; John Hinshaw , 67 , of Levittown , New York ; Heather Idoni , 61 , of Linden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the Bronx , New York ; and Joan Bell , 74 , of Montague , New Jersey.\n\u201d \u201c The indictment also alleges that all 10 defendants violated the FACE Act by using a physical obstruction to injure , intimidate and interfere with the clinic \u2019 s employees and a patient , because they were providing or obtaining reproductive health services , \u201d the DOJ continued in its recent press release .\nA description of the demonstration by LifeSiteNews , however , paints a far less charged picture : The protest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as provisions of the FACE Act , which criminalizes \u201c attempts to \u2026 interfere with \u201d a person for \u201c obtaining or providing reproductive health services.\n\u201d The law was passed in 1994 and designed to crack down on attempted bombings or arson of abortion offices .\nThe DOJ claims , \u201c The FACE Act is not about abortions [ but ] protects all patients , providers , and facilities that provide reproductive health services , including pro-life pregnancy counseling services.\n\u201d But under Biden \u2019 s Justice Department , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to abortion facilities .\nFurthermore , if the overbroad law can be stretched by corrupt G-men to prosecute peaceful Americans exercising their First Amendment rights \u2014 as the Garland DOJ has since stretched it \u2014 Congress should repeal it .\nIn a just world , federal law wouldn \u2019 t exist to protect the practice of killing babies in their mothers \u2019 wombs .\nBut since it does , it appears the FBI made an easy example out of Geraghty and the nine other participants who were indicted in March of this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to a maximum of 11 years in prison , three years of supervised release and a fine of up to $ 260,000 , \u201d even though their alleged crimes pale in comparison to the devastation wrought by abortion activists shattering windows and pitching Molotov cocktails into pro-life pregnancy resource centers .\nSince the roundup of nine pro-lifers who participated in the D.C. protest , the FBI has made similar arrests of pro-life protesters whose alleged crimes are far less clear \u2014 indicating that the weaponized agency is becoming more emboldened in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s radical pro-abortion stance .\nOn Sept. 23 , some 20 to 30 armed FBI agents with more than a dozen vehicles swarmed Catholic pro-life activist and author Mark Houck \u2019 s Pennsylvania home and arrested him in front of his children , according to Houck \u2019 s wife Ryan-Marie .\nHouck is accused of \u201c attacking a patient escort \u201d named Bruce Love at a Planned Parenthood facility in violation of the FACE Act .\nBut Ryan-Marie says her husband only \u201c shoved him away from his child \u201d after Love refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and \u201c came into [ the son \u2019 s ] personal space.\n\u201d Furthermore , as The Federalist \u2019 s Senior Legal Correspondent Margot Cleveland reported : The case against Mark was thrown out of the district court in Philadelphia earlier this year , LifeSiteNews reported , but the FBI picked it up as the federal agency continues to wage war on the administration \u2019 s political opponents .\nHouck faces \u201c a maximum possible sentence of 11 years in prison , three years of supervised release , and fines of up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oct. 5 , the DOJ unsealed another indictment against \u201c Chester Gallagher , Heather Idoni , Calvin Zastrow , Coleman Boyd , Caroline Davis , Paul Vaughn , Dennis Green , Eva Edl , Eva Zastrow , James Zastrow and Paul Place \u201d for \u201c an alleged reproductive health care clinic blockade in Mount Juliet , Tennessee , on March 5 , 2021.\n\u201d They are accused of using \u201c force and physical obstruction to injure , intimidate and interfere with employees of the clinic and a patient who was seeking reproductive health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fines if convicted .\nThe FBI conducted an armed raid on Gallagher \u2019 s home on the same day , entering his home and questioning his neighbors when agents realized Gallagher was out of town .\nAs The Federalist \u2019 s Evita Duffy noted , far from using violence , the 11 peaceful protesters \u201c lined the inside hallway of a medical building that houses multiple offices , including the Carafem abortion facility , and peacefully tried to convince mothers seeking an abortion to choose life.\n\u201d As the FBI targets pro-lifers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superficial crimes , what has it done to hold accountable the pro-abortion terrorists who firebombed numerous pro-life organizations and pregnancy resource centers after the Supreme Court removed its prohibition on state abortion bans ?\nApparently nothing .\nA Federalist review of Justice Department press releases in 2022 revealed not a single announcement of the arrest or indictment of a pregnancy center arsonist .\nIt took the FBI 44 days after the Dobbs opinion leaked to even acknowledge it was investigating incidents of violence against pro-life groups .\nAs The Federalist \u2019 s Jordan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arrest of peaceful pro-lifers but not of violent pro-abortionists confirms Biden \u2019 s DOJ does not equally apply the law.\n\u201d Asked on Tuesday if \u201c the FBI has made any arrests related to the vandalism , firebombing , etc .\nof dozens of pregnancy resource centers and churches around the country since the leak of the Supreme Court \u2019 s Dobbs v. Jackson decision ?\n\u201d the FBI refused to comment .\nThe FBI also declined to answer whether any individuals had been indicted , or if the FBI had conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those used to target pro-life activists Mark Houck and Chester Gallagher ; the agency directed The Federalist to the DOJ for indictment inquiries .\nThe DOJ did not respond .\nPLEASE HELP SUPPORT OUR INDEPENDENT MEDIA

through a deeply perverse and purposeful top-down indoctrination process .\nWell , we know something about this .\nIn 1969 , at a gathering of pediatricians in Pittsburgh , USA , a certain doctor Richard Day stood-up and communicated a remarkable polemic about the future of humanity which he asked the attendant doctors not to take notes about .\nHowever one doctor , Lawrence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to jot-down the basic story .\nWhat he recorded is now a famous document which accurately described the precise plans/agenda of The New World Order cabal for the years ahead .\nOne of Dr Day \u2019 s key statements was \u201c We are going to make boys and girls the same.\n\u201d Making boys and girls the same is a process emanating from the Transhumanist school now being promoted as part of The Great Reset of the World Economic Forum and its director Klaus Schwab .\nThe Great Reset will \u2018 re-set \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexless \u2019 .\nOr to persuade males to become females and females to become males .\nIts aim is to contribute to depopulation goals by ensuring that no more procreation is possible for anyone other than the elite cabal who are to retain the privilege of having children via physical intercourse .\nThis \u2018 re-set \u2019 has already been pronounced by Schwab \u2019 s leading advisor , Israeli Professor Yuval Noah Harari , who recently stated outright \u201c We will

Kurzweil .\nThe promotion of a \u2018 Trans species \u2019 is giving us a view of the darkest territory of the mind .\nThe mind of the Luciferian/Masonic initiate .\nThis is the agenda for the deliberate dehumanisation of humankind .\nAnd it is now going public because its initiators clearly believe they can \u2018 reset \u2019 the social , moral and ethical map of the world .\nThis includes the social , ethical and spiritual evolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Universe and replacing them with a goal of biological sterility , is an agenda coming from \u2018 the other side \u2019 .\nBy this I mean , coming from the reversed consciousness of the despisers of humanity .\nDemonic forces .\nBut Schwab \u2019 s team has worked-out a way of selling this bleak future under the guise of

.\nA time of discovering what it means to be male and female and how society expects one to behave .\nAt this time in life it is quite easy to be enticed into a self harming mode , out of an irrational urge to be nonconformist .\nMany parents of such youth seem devoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their offspring along a road of health and sanity .\nWhile doctors and physicians offer the disfiguring surgery and debilitating drugs as though they were a routine medical procedure , exhibiting no ethical or moral fibre to resist the horror of what the Cabal expects of them \u2013 or the fees involved in performing the mutations .\nThe children , for they are such , think they are making this decision ; but their unformed minds have been poisoned and stolen from them just at the point when they are

control .\nOne has an inescapable sense that the apocalypse is not the future , but the present .\nA whole raft of humanity is allowing itself to become a vector for a programmed descent into a torture chamber devised and run by the princes of darkness .\nA number of those on the brink of being operated on have been persuaded not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have spoken-out and said how hugely relieved they are that they were helped and saved from the tragic sterile journey which lay in wait for them .\nOne can only hope that their testimonies are heard by others too confused to know which way to turn .\nBy teachers and councilors whose professions are supposed to be founded on responsible counseling of the young .\nHow could anyone with a heart and a modicum of self-respect possibly withdraw their guidance from highly vulnerable young people drifting and frightened within the present sea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Order is the father of The Great Reset .\nIt is a prison camp run by soulless entities who resemble humans .\nEach step of its manifestation is composed of a seemingly high ideal : \u2022 None A \u2018 central electromagnetic surveillance system \u2019 to \u2018 watch over \u2019 all areas of one \u2019 s life .\n\u2022 None A \u2018 microchip under the skin \u2019 for \u2018 convenient \u2019 banking/shopping operations .\nAnd now \u2018 Trans \u2019 people , to prove the fact that it \u2019 s your \u2018 right \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God \u2019 s .\nGod , after all , might have got it wrong .\nThe creation of a non biological human race is absolutely central to the

a better job than God \u2019 .\nThe supposed \u2018 removal of pain \u2019 is a further component of this exercise .\nMuch of society is already conditioned to feel it can \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ averse

.\nBut despite his aggressive rhetoric and actions , Reagan just as aggressively engaged in diplomacy with the Soviets \u2013 something that we \u2019 re not seeing from the Biden administration .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its recklessness .\n\u201c For the first time since the Cuban missile crisis , we have the threat of a nuclear weapon if in fact things continue down the path they are going , \u201d Biden said at a Democratic Party fundraiser in early October .\n\u201c We are trying to figure out , what is Putin \u2019 s off-ramp ?\n\u201d Here \u2019 s a thought : Maybe try asking him rather than guessing ?\nThat \u2019 s what diplomacy is for .\nYou sit down with the other party to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table , and start figuring out .\nRonald Reagan didn \u2019 t just shrug off nuclear Armageddon in a public address .\nBy all accounts , nuclear Armageddon terrified Reagan and it \u2019 s what drove him to the negotiating table with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev , resulting in an arms control treaty in 1986 , and well before the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 .\nReagan also didn \u2019 t tell the Soviets that Washington-backed proxies in Afghanistan , Nicaragua , Angola , Cambodia , Ethiopia , Iran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine how and when these conflicts would end .\nUnlike , Biden , who figures that Ukraine will be the ultimate arbiter .\nPeace deals between Washington proxies and their opponents always involve the US .\nNo one is fooled as to who \u2019 s fueling these conflicts .\nIf funding and weapons flow ended , then negotiations would be the only exit ramp .\nTo play dumb and pretend otherwise in the case of Ukraine is just an excuse to perpetuate endless war \u2013 which is exactly what Cheney and the neocons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aisle who agree with her are effectively supporting .\nWhat Cheney considers to be the \u201c pro-Putin wing \u201d of her party is actually the most Reaganesque .\nEven Putin himself is more Reaganesque than Cheney thinks , having adopted the supply-side \u201c Reaganomics \u201d of lowering taxes , less regulation , and anti-inflationary monetary policy .\nIf the Biden administration was more respectful and cordial with geopolitical foes , as Reagan was with Gorbachev and towards the Russian people whose technological accomplishments he reportedly admired , then maybe it could grease the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a private visit to Reagan \u2019 s Rancho Del Cielo near Santa Barbara , California ( also known as the \u201c Western White House \u201d during the Reagan years ) several years ago , I had the opportunity to sit at the table where Reagan kicked back with the Soviet leader just after the end of the Cold War in 1992 .\nAs acrimonious as things seemed during those critical times of major East-West tension , Reagan didn \u2019 t stop reaching out in all his affability .\nAnd speaking of the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Harvard economists who headed to Moscow in the \u2018 90s as an economic advisor \u2013 who can hardly be accused of being \u201c pro-Putin \u201d \u2013 is also now pointing out how ludicrous it is to bank on the current US position of a Ukraine military victory at all costs .\n\u201c What it means is an escalation of the war , an escalation of global dangers , an escalation of the economic fallout and a lost opportunity to find an off-ramp to this conflict as was taking shape already , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now a Columbia University professor .\nRepublicans , or anyone else , questioning the neocon endless war strategy in Ukraine are about as \u201c pro-Putin \u201d as Reagan was \u201c pro-Soviet.\n\u201d Cheney \u2019 s selective read of the Reagan era , and of the man and leader himself , does a disservice to his legacy of diplomacy and to those who seek to carry it on .\nPLEASE HELP SUPPORT OUR INDEPENDENT MEDIA PLATFORM HERE", "author": "NEWS WIRE", "url":

drones to its Black Sea naval base of Sevastopol .\nKIEV , Ukraine ( AP ) \u2014 Russia announced Saturday that it will immediately suspend its implementation of a U.N.-brokered grain deal that has seen more than 9 million tons of grain exported from Ukraine during the war and has brought down soaring global food prices .\nUkraine accused Russia of creating a world \u201c hunger games.\n\u201d The Russian Defense Ministry cited an alleged Ukrainian drone attack Saturday against Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the coast of occupied Crimea as the reason for the move .\nUkraine has denied the attack , saying that the Russians mishandled their own weapons .\nThe Russian declaration came one day after U.N. chief Antonio Guterres urged Russia and Ukraine to renew the grain export deal , which was scheduled to expire on Nov. 19 .\nGuterres also urged other countries , mainly in the West , to expedite the removal of obstacles blocking Russian grain and fertilizer exports .\nThe U.N. chief said

, Reddit , Discord , Wikipedia , Microsoft , and LinkedIn and others , including the recently-fired head of \u201c trust & safety \u201d political censorship department at Twitter , Vijaya Gadde , held regular secret meetings with the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) to discuss ways in which partisan social media executives could assist the Biden campaign and subsequent Administration \u2013 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views and subjects \u2013 including the White House \u2019 s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan , the Hunter Biden laptop scandal , as well as enforcing the government \u2019 s COVID-19 and lockdown narratives , and even enforcing \u201c racial justice \u201d speech online , according to new documents leaked to The Intercept .\nThe leak reveals how partisan tech executives met with the FBI and other government agencies on a monthly basis , prior to and following the 2020 election .\nCorrupt Facebook executives even set up a special portal for \u201c takedowns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email to access .\nThe leaked information also includes secret documents and minutes revealed in Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt \u2019 s lawsuit filed against the Biden Administration which alleges federal government collusion with Big Tech firms specifically to suppress Americans \u2019 First Amendment rights .\nThe timely revelation also exposes two partisan FBI officials who were directly involved in high-level communications with Facebook to suppress the infamous Hunter Biden laptop story \u2013 Laura Dehmlow , the section chief of the FBI \u2019 s Foreign Influence Task Force ( FITF ) and Elvis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco field office .\nIn addition to this , the FBI agents were also telling Twitter executives that subversive information on social media \u2018 could undermine support \u2019 for the US government .\nThe FITF was created in 2019 in response to fictional claims by Democrats , the US Intelligence Community , and corporate mainstream media \u2013 that alleged \u201c Russian influence \u201d on social media somehow got Donald Trump elected in 2016 .\nThe FBI would later expand the scope of its censorship dragnet to

nature of US support to Ukraine.\n\u201d It \u2019 s a stunning revelation for sure , which confirms the depth of corruption and unconstitutional activities carried out by US federal agencies who clearly view themselves as above the law .\nThe federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misinformation \u201d and \u201c disinformation \u201d \u2013 what we might more accurately describe as Big Brother \u2019 s

Bang\u2019 Bust Britain?", "content": "Rishi Sunak , the UK \u2019 s incumbent Prime Minister has set out his ambition to emulate Thatcher \u2019 s 1986 \u201c Big Bang \u201d of financial deregulation .\nHowever , looking at the lay of the land in 2022 , is sweeping deregulation the answer to Britons \u2019 financial woes ?\nI like to stay out of day-to-day politics , with its bland statements which never address the real issue at hand , inflammatory language designed to evoke emotions over reason and all the while ensuring that the puppet masters are able to work away behind the scenes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was drawn in recently to the economic proposal presented by the new Prime Minister of Britain .\nI liken the position more to a president , or dictator , as much of today \u2019 s UK governance is done by executive order , rather than through parliamentary deliberation .\nIn fact , there is probably a question of legitimacy at the heart of this issue which provoked my ire .\nOne basic precept of British politics is that of a mandate ; the right to rule .\nA government , a leader and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule from their mandate .\nThis is made up of a few sources of power and a couple of processes .\nOne source of power is the monarchy , which is historically said to divine its power directly from God .\nWhilst we don \u2019 t know if that phone line is still connected \u2013 we do know that British monarchs are still tied in with dictators , autocrats , kings and sultans in regimes further afield like Saudi Arabia , or Azerbaijan , as well as influential wealthy aristocrats , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world .\nYet , the monarch is viewed as more vestigial in British politics .\nThe late Queen Elizabeth spent most of her time rubber-stamping legislation , to interfere would draw her huge wealth and power into controversial territory .\nThus , MPs and their supporters like to present the greatest source of power as \u2018 from the people \u2019 .\nThe temperature of this power is now taken once every 5 years at a general election , and sometimes in-between at by-elections .\nThese elections allow someone to claim jurisdiction over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to represent those constituents \u2019 views in parliament .\nThis is the foundation of representative democracy .\nFor this reason , I will posit that the level of abstraction that is taken to claim such authority is too large of a chasm to be effective .\nI take the example of Alexander De Pfeffel ( Boris ) Johnson , the blue-blooded former PM , who was elected as representative of Uxbridge and Ruislip .\nHaving failed to be elected in Wales in 2001 , he was parachuted to this more favourable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25,000 votes .\nHowever , he only beat out his competitor \u2019 s 18,000 votes by a small margin and gained just 52 % of the votes cast in the area , with just two thirds of the people turning out .\nThus , he had no real mandate , and was allowed to become MP and then by selection from the ruling party , he was allowed to become Prime Minister , and I prefer the term , dictator , of the UK .\nFrom there he can travel the world signing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billions of pounds to companies and countries , striking deals with ne \u2019 er-do-wells and pushing through wide-reaching national laws and lockdowns by executive order without the assent of 99.97 % of the British people .\nPerhaps this is the rot at the core of the system which rankles me .\nRishi Sunak , in his first speech after inheriting the bully pulpit , made sure to address this issue of mandate : \u201c And I know he [ Johnson ] would agree that the mandate my party earned in 2019 is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is a mandate that belongs to and unites all of us.\n\u201d Here we can see our dear leader Sunak claiming that since some people voted for his team in 2019 , he has the authority to rule in the name of the newly crowned King .\nNo need to discuss what occurred in those 3 years .\nNo need to hold another election , or have anybody question his authority , the mandate has been passed round the Conservative Party like a small boy is passed round King Charles \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nYet , I \u2019 m not here just for stuffy debates on the UK \u2019 s constitution , or to make cheap jibes about the Royal family \u2019 s various and sundry scandals , like paedophilia .\nThere are bigger issues going on with real ramifications for the unsuspecting people of Britain \u2013 and these trends are reflected globally .\nRishi Sunak and his family \u2019 s net worth is at least in the hundreds of millions .\nHilariously , the UK state media was falling over itself to inform us that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a mere \u00a3730 million net worth .\nIt \u2019 s his father-in-law that \u2019 s a multi-billionaire , and we shouldn \u2019 t worry about his non-domiciled wife who paid no tax in the UK for decades .\nYet more pressing of an issue that raw wealth is the links and influences behind it .\nBefore he worked for the \u201c hard working families of Britain \u201d Sunak worked between 2001-2004 for Goldman Sachs \u2013 a fact which he chooses to not put on his Linked-In profile .\nPerhaps it is because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level .\nThat his positioning as Prime Minister is a banker takeover of the UK .\nNow this is not the first banker takeover of the UK .\nIn fact much of Britain \u2019 s global stature is borne of financialisation .\nWe could debate if it was first through the East India Company and the establishment of the British Empire through mercantilism and pillage , or domination of global financial systems through the City of London .\nYet with his new \u2018 Financial Services and Markets Bill \u2019 it is Thatcher \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1980s that dear leader Sunak wishes to emulate , I will begin by briefly describing it .\nThatcher was a singular leader in British history , her ideological drive and use of executive power marked a change from the more deliberative methods of politics used before .\nShe pushed hard for example for free-market ideas , at all costs .\nShe incurred rolling blackouts and mass strikes when she destroyed the coal and steel industries in the UK through deregulation .\nBut she would not be stopped .\n1983 saw an agreement between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settle an antitrust case brought by the previous government .\nThe antitrust case alleged that the London Stock Exchange was not serving investors or obeying laws property , it was abusing its position as market maker to serve its own profits .\nInvestigations had shown that the rampant old-boys networks in the City of London lead to an occluded miasma of financial operations and allowed a great deal of profiteering .\nThe Big Bang was to break up sections of the Exchange , such as market makers and buyers , so they weren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office .\nOstensibly this seemed like a good idea ; it was a reflection of the Glass-Stegall act in the USA which sought to separate and divide retail banking from investment and thereby protect regular savers from the vagaries of speculative investment .\nThis dichotomy is known as the \u2018 moral hazard \u2019 as bankers can risk someone else \u2019 s money without any risk to their own wealth , and if the trade goes bad , the unsuspecting saver is hit with the bill .\nBut Thatcher was not working for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package of reforms included privatising the London Stock Exchange , which would allow foreign investors to take up shares in the exchange .\nIt also included wide-ranging deregulation of stock trading as well as a move to electronic screen based trading .\nAll of these policies taken together created a huge boom in the UK \u2019 s financial sector , it became the center for stock trading in the world and created tumorous sky-scrapers such as Canary Wharf in the heart of London .\nIt unleashed a new regime of free market trading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the 2008-2009 financial crisis , even her own chancellor Nigel Lawson would come to regret the scope of deregulation : \u201c I didn \u2019 t give it a great deal of thought at that time .\nI \u2019 d taken for granted that separation , as by custom and practice we \u2019 d had that all those years ( we \u2019 d always had it ) , but it [ the financial crisis ] was a completely unforeseen consequence of the stock exchange reforms \u201d 5 The first Big Bang opened up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the next cyclical collapse larger .\nFurthermore , despite trying to combat the homogenisation of banking where too much power was concentrated in one institution , the open market solution lead to the agglomeration of international financial institutions like Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers who became \u2018 too big to fail \u2019 .\nThey had created a monster too large to kill , or let die .\nRather than that , central banks decided to bail-out these failing behemoths through money printing and quantitative easing .\nThe Big Bang reforms included wide-ranging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It helped create the Financial Conduct Authority , where we run into Andrew Bailey .\nHe also works for the Bank of England , and is heralded for the aforementioned quantitative easing packages .\nHe worked in the department charged with printing the way out of a debt hole .\nA policy which for a decade or so seemed successful , though some critics held the line that this was only patching up the cracks and not addressing the systemic problem at the core .\nYet , Bailey \u2019 s tenure at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was implicated in the collapse of London Capital & Finance Investment in 2019 .\nThe Investment group offered lucrative 8 % returns on products they sold , taking in over \u00a3200 million of investors \u2019 money .\nYet behind the scenes it was an unregulated mess , rather than taking a basket of low-risk investments they saw fit to pump money into a dodgy Faroese oil venture and splash out on a corporate helicopter .\nThe company folded at a total loss after 3 years .\nAs head of the Financial Conduct Authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people at fault in a government investigation.6 He is also famous , rather infamous , for falling asleep during a hearing over the speculative use of pension funds which had lead to many pensions being wiped.7 Sleepy Bailey woke up one morning in early March 2020 , a pivotal month in global politics , to find that he had been inculcated as head of the Bank of England .\nDays later our dear leader Johnson would declare universal lockdown , strip the public of rights to protest , to walk the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBailey was handed the poisoned chalice of an economy in flux .\nThe year 2019 had seen a year of zero growth .\nCentral banks had been keeping interest rates at near zero to prevent the breakout of rampant inflation , which has since cracked its shackles and broken free .\nBailey and the Banks \u2019 tactic through the controlled demolition of the economy was a photocopy of the 2008/9 policy : extend and pretend .\nThey would continue to print money , they would submit to any spending regime proposed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretend they were in control of a veering ship .\nYet when the Bank of England prints up to the tune of a trillion pounds in two years , and hands it to big corporations and banks decided by politicians , there are problems .\nOne is that the currency is diluted : the money in your pocket is worth less when the supply is increased .\nBut they don \u2019 t care much about the paper or plastic money in your pocket , that being only a fraction of the fully diluted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow in floods of bits and bytes through computers .\nA central bank can simply declare a bond buyback and pay off all of the junk they issued as valid bonds years ago .\nI would argue that this pernicious form of stealth tax is the cause of the so-called cost of living crisis .\nAndrew Bailey would disagree .\nHe , in a recent Mansion House speech , laid the blame anywhere but at his doorstep.8 He first mentioned the lockdowns and the \u201c precipitous downturn in economic activity \u201d , adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compromised by a premature withdrawal of stimulus \u201d ; that being a counterfactual statement as we don \u2019 t have a control economy with which to compare .\nBut a post-hoc rationalisation is what financial criminals thrive on .\nSo we have the lockdowns , which were , I re-iterate , a controlled demolition of economies worldwide , which saw billionaires make billions , whilst the poorest bore the harms .\nBut he goes on to start banging upon the favourite button of politicians today : \u2018 but Russia \u2019 .\n\u201c The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to UK inflation by some way.\n\u201d Yet I think this warrants addressing .\nBailey is not alone in bashing Russia , it seems everywhere you turn you will see ill-informed people blaming \u2018 Putin \u2019 s war of aggression \u2019 for the economic misdemeanours worldwide .\nSunak \u2019 s opening address even echoes Bailey , \u201c Covid lingers .\nPutin \u2019 s war in Ukraine has destabilised energy markets and supply chains the world over.\n\u201d 9 It \u2019 s almost like they are on the same team , even though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our dear leader Tony Blair in 1997 .\nThat \u2019 s beside the point as we know politicians , banks and organised criminals are all in bed together .\nBut does Russia really warrant the blame for global supply issues , and the rise in food and energy prices .\nI \u2019 m not so sure .\n\u2018 Global Justice \u2019 are a group which has been working on food speculation for a decade .\nThey have campaigned against the financialisation of the food supply .\nIt is a nefarious process which corrupts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ll put it simply thusly : food producers wish to get a loan to cover the cost of growing a crop , this is then sold as a \u2018 future contract \u2019 to be paid back when the food is grown , processed and sold .\nAll good .\nAnd yet , when vulture capitalists get involved it goes awry , they don \u2019 t care whether the wheat is grown or not , they will trade these contracts , package them up with other contracts and even bet on them failing .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , there is a white collar criminal turning a profit on that credit default .\nThis malfeasance in the food sector means that even though enough food in the world is grown each year to feed the world , much of it is squandered such that millions will starve .\nThey give us this stark fact to contrast the blame Russia narrative : \u201c Corporate titans in the food and energy sectors have made nearly half a trillion dollars in the last two years , with 62 new billionaires created off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while five of the largest energy companies , including BP , Shell and Total , are making $ 2,600 of profit every second.\n\u201d 10 They also point out that food production and base cost has remained very steady over the last few years .\nThere hasn \u2019 t been a mass collapse in farming , yet .\nThere hasn \u2019 t been a huge boom in demand either .\nThe real distortion in the food sector is the unregulated swamp of financial profiteers .\nAnd despite Sunak and Bailey \u2019 s claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices have fallen back to pre-war levels11 .\nSo the pain at the checkout in the supermarket is not Putin \u2019 s fault .\nThe pain at the pump is not caused by a foreign dictator .\nIt is a necessary product of the unaccountable political system corroborating with the unregulated financial sector to reap profit from human suffering .\nIt seems the robber barons of yore never really went away , they just put on a suit and tie and logged onto a computer .\nWith that in mind we turn back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.0 .\nA sad little policy document really , hoping to emulate the massive deregulation by Thatcher in the 1980s , but it is just more technocratic guff .\nThey wish to harness Britain \u2019 s position of having one foot in the EU and one out to reclaim their crown as money-launderer-in-chief .\nSunak wishes to use the rollback of EU regulation to open up UK markets to global financial criminals .\nThis is not to say that overbearing regulation from the European Union is a good thing .\nBut I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 2014 financial regulation which among other things sought to reign in the amount of food price speculation one company can partake in .\nThis policy even irked the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation enough to put a puff piece in the Guardian where they had the gall to say that regulating the food speculation sector could cause more hunger worldwide.12 Sunak wishes to depart from that regime to allow London to be the capital of food speculation .\nOther reforms include an intention to draw what money remains in British pension funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more lucrative spheres .\nWe can only suspect that the vultures were in the room when this policy was drafted as those pensions are in dire straits right now , and to put them into high-risk speculation is un-conscionable when you consider that their failure would put millions of pensioners into poverty .\nSimultaneously they have a dogged drive under the Green regime to pump money into the financialisation of nature .\n\u201c The UK \u2019 s needs around infrastructure spending and the green transition more generally , are too significant to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower risk assets \u201d 13 .\nTo meet the demands of the elite created COP/IPCC climate regime demands on carbon emissions , they have created a huge demand for carbon offset projects , yet another boondoggle for the financiers , and another insufferable cost for the poorest of the population .\nEven section 22 of Sunak \u2019 s Financial Services and Markets Bill on Cryptocurrency , leaves much to be desired .\nThe announcement initially lead to a boost in the Crypto markets who love any signal of state adoption .\nAt first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating a legal regime to allow cryptocurrency companies to operate .\nBut they are actually attempting to define them as \u201c digital settlement assets \u201d rather than currencies .\nThey much prefer stablecoins , which are pegged to central bank currencies , to the uncontrolled cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin .\nA digital currency outside of the central bank remit would be a massive threat .\nYet a digital asset that central bank could pump up and distribute without such strict regulation would allow for much more of the same kind of racketeering to occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSo the state of things as a new leader takes office is dark .\nThe bones of the UK \u2019 s economy are being gleaned by vulture capitalists .\nMeanwhile , the state media is constantly puffing up the legitimacy of this week \u2019 s dear leader , and of the much shamed monarchy .\nPrices are rising out of control due to financial speculation whilst the currency is being systematically eroded by central bankers .\nAnd they maintain a narrative of blaming a foreign government , and much of the supplicant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can all feel that something is going very wrong .\nI don \u2019 t have an optimistic outlook for the British economy .\nYet , I do believe that outside of these nefarious systems humanity can thrive .\nWe don \u2019 t need central banks to survive , but they do need us .\nWe have alternative currencies that we can use , they do not .\nAnd we are wising up to their games by the day .\n3 https :

recent statement contained in its new report on the future of the energy markets .\nAccording to their latest assessment , Europe will experience natural gas shortages through the winter of 2023-2024 \u2013 because EU countries will likely have difficulty refilling their storage facilities during the summer months .\nTo compound the problem , most countries will have nearly depleted their emergency reserves in order cope during the winter of 2022-2023 .\nAside from the EU \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of anti-Russia sanctions and cutting off its supply of affordable and reliable Russia gas , an increase in global demand next year will hit the EU especially hard , as European governments struggle to \u201c structurally reduce gas demand \u201d across the region .\nEurope could face a gap of as much as 30 billion cubic metres ( bcm ) of natural gas during the key summer period for refilling its gas storage sites in 2023 , the IEA said in new analysis published today , highlighting the need for urgent action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the global energy crisis .\nThe new report \u2013 Never too early to prepare for next winter : Europe \u2019 s gas balance for 2023-2024 \u2013 shows that gas storage sites in the European Union are now 95 % full \u2013 putting them 5 % above the 5-year average fill level .\nBut the report cautions that the cushion provided by current storage levels , as well as recent lower gas prices and unusually mild temperatures , should not lead to overly optimistic conclusions about the future .\nThe process of filling EU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key factors that may well not be repeated in 2023 .\nThese include Russian pipeline gas deliveries that , although they were cut sharply during 2022 , were close to \u2018 normal \u2019 levels for much of the first half of the year .\nTotal pipeline supply from Russia to the EU in 2022 is likely to amount to around 60 bcm , but it is highly unlikely that Russia will deliver another 60 bcm of pipeline gas in 2023 \u2013 and Russian deliveries to Europe could halt completely .\nOn top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural gas ( LNG ) imports in the first ten months of this year have been a key enabler of higher LNG availability for Europe to compensate for the drop in gas deliveries from Russia .\nIf China \u2019 s LNG imports recover next year to their 2021 levels , this would capture over 85 % of the expected increase in global LNG supply .\nAnd global LNG supply is expected to increase by only 20 bcm in 2023 , with about one-third of the growth coming from the United States .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year is about half the average increase during the 2016-2019 period and much less than the likely decline in Russian pipeline deliveries to the EU next year .\nIn the event of a full cessation of Russian pipeline gas supplies to the EU and a recovery of Chinese LNG imports to 2021 levels , the new IEA analysis shows that Europe could face a challenging supply-demand gap of 30 bcm during the key period for

between US President Joe Biden and his Ukrainian counterpart , Vladimir Zelensky , turned testy after the Ukrainian leader pressed Biden for more assistance .\nOn June 15 , Biden called Zelensky to inform him of the recent release of some $ 1 billion in assistance ( this included the drawdown of arms and equipment from US Department of Defense inventories valued at $ 350 million , and $ 650 million in additional assistance under the department \u2019 s Ukraine Security Assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication had become commonplace since Russia \u2019 s decision to send troops into Ukraine in February 2022 , with Biden informing Zelensky of each major assistance allocation in a program that had , as of June 15 , seen the dispatch of some $ 5.6 billion in American military aid .\nThis time , however , rather than thank the US president , as had been the previous practice , Zelensky proceeded to ask for more assistance , citing specific requests for equipment that had not been included in the June allocation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s sources say , Biden lost his temper .\n\u201c The American people were being quite generous , and his administration and the US military were working hard to help Ukraine , he said , raising his voice , and Zelensky could show a little more gratitude , \u201d the NBC story reports .\nAccording to NBC , the source of Biden \u2019 s anger went beyond the lack of gratitude shown by Zelensky ( NBC reports that the two leaders have since warmed to one another ) , but rather the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biden White House that support for the blank check being written for Ukraine \u2019 s war effort is waning among members of Congress on both sides of the aisle .\nWith the Republicans expected to retake control of the House of Representatives and positioned to do the same in the Senate in the upcoming mid-term elections , the Biden administration appears poised to try to squeeze out another $ 40-60 billion in aid during the lame duck session between the election and when the present term of Congress expires next January .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be challenged by the Republicans , who will seek to have its consideration postponed

the actual conduct of the conflict , including the provision of targeting data in support of US-provided artillery systems such as the M777 howitzer and the HIMARS multiple rocket launch system .\nIts two main messages can be summarized as follows : first , American weapons are helping Ukraine stand up to Russia and showing the world Putin can be defeated , and second , the US is taking every care not to cross any lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct confrontation with Moscow .\nBased in Moscow for many years , Yaffa is an experienced writer on Russian affairs .\nThe scope and scale of the sources he was able to draw upon in writing his most recent article is a \u2018 who \u2019 s who \u2019 of US and Ukrainian officialdom .\nBoth named and unnamed , all of them are well positioned to provide Yaffa with the kind of inside information that makes his article so attractive , both from an informational aspect , and readability .\nOn the Ukrainian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukraine \u2019 s defense minister ;

pursuit of a radical \u2018 green \u2019 agenda .\nJOLIET , Ill. ( AP ) \u2014 President Joe Biden on Saturday was criticized by West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin , a Democratic antagonist and ally , for being \u201c cavalier \u201d and \u201c divorced from reality \u201d after vowing to shutter coal-fired power plants and rely more heavily on wind and solar energy in the future .\nThe powerful coal-state lawmaker said Biden \u2019 s words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for people from higher energy prices and are why Americans \u201c are losing trust \u201d in Biden .\nManchin \u2019 s stinging rebuke of his party \u2019 s leader comes at precarious time for Democrats on the final weekend of campaigning before Tuesday \u2019 s elections that could put Republicans back in power in Congress .\nManchin called for a public apology , and the White House later released a statement saying Biden \u2019 s words had been \u201c twisted to suggest a meaning that was not intended \u201d and that the president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks took offense.\n\u201d Biden raised Manchin \u2019 s ire with his reference to coal power during a speech Friday in Carlsbad , California , to spotlight his $ 280 billion plan to boost the semiconductor industry and scientific research .\n\u201c I was in Massachusetts about a month ago on the site of the largest old coal plant in America .\nGuess what ?\nIt cost them too much money , \u201d Biden said .\n\u201c No one is building new coal plants because they can \u2019 t rely on it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guaranteed for the rest of their existence of the plant .\nSo it \u2019 s going to become a wind generation , \u201d Biden added .\n\u201c We \u2019 re going to be shutting these plants down all across America and having wind and solar.\n\u201d Biden had visited a former coal-fired power plant in Massachusetts in July .\nThe former Brayton Point power plant in Somerset is shifting to offshore wind power manufacturing , and Biden chose it as the embodiment of the transition to clean energy that he is seeking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed with Manchin \u2019 s help in August .\nFormer President Donald Trump promised to revive coal and restore mining jobs , but the industry \u2019 s decadelong decline continued as utilities increasingly turn to cheaper natural gas \u2014 and now renewable energy such as wind and solar power \u2014 to generate electricity .\nThe Energy Information Administration , a government agency , reports a yearly average of 39,518 employees at U.S. coal mines in 2021 , compared with 91,611 in 2011 , 51,795 in 2016 and 42,159 in 2020 .\nWyoming is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee , said in a statement that Biden \u2019 s remarks were \u201c not only outrageous and divorced from reality , they ignore the severe economic pain the American people are feeling because of rising energy costs.\n\u201d Such remarks , Manchin said , \u201c are the reason the American people are losing trust in President Biden .\n\u2026 It seems his positions change daily depending on the audience and politics of the day.\n\u201d Manchin , whose support was crucial to Biden winning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which included the biggest investment in climate programs in U.S. history , slammed Biden for \u201c offensive and disgusting \u201d words and said the president owed West Virginia coal workers \u201c an immediate and public apology.\n\u201d \u201c Let me be clear , this is something the president has never said to me .\nBeing cavalier about the coal jobs for men and women in West Virginia and across the country who literally put their lives on the line to help build and power this country is offensive and disgusting , \u201d Manchin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he learn a lesson that his words matter and have consequences.\n\u201d The White House said Biden was \u201c commenting on a fact of economics and technology \u201d at a time when the country is undertaking an \u201c energy transition \u201d that he is working to ensure means \u201c more jobs and better opportunities .\n\u2026 No one will be left behind.\n\u201d The EIA projects that coal generation is expected to decline from 22.5 % of U.S. electricity in 2021 to 21.1 % in 2022 , before falling to 19.9 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share as 2020 when production hit its lowest level in decades , in part because of COVID-19 .\nNatural gas is expected to make up for some of coal \u2019 s declining share in 2022 and beyond .\nCoal produced more than 40 % of U.S. electricity though 2011 before a steep decline caused by the fracking boom .\nIn late 2021 , Manchin torpedoed Biden \u2019 s big domestic policy bill , leading to a hardball response from the White House to a lawmaker whose

officials is not aimed at pushing Ukraine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said .\nRather , they called it a calculated attempt to ensure the government in Kyiv maintains the support of other nations facing

over the next few weeks , and I say that as a friend of Donald Trump.\n\u201d While the Red Wave apparently failed to materialise , Governor DeSantis swept to a stunning victory , defeating his Democrat challenger , former governor Charlie Christ by nearly 20 per cent , up from a 0.4 per cent victory in the 2018 contest that saw him become governor of Florida .\nIn a speech from Tampa , DeSantis said that Florida Has \u201c rewritten the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in former Democrat strongholds such as Miami-Dade county .\nMr Farage said that in light of the large margin for victory for the Florida governor \u201c the numbers supporting the DeSantis will be much higher than it was before , so there could be a really titanic clash here between two alpha males.\n\u201d Though the Brexiteer said that he believes if the contest were held now , Trump has the advantage as he had the \u201c overwhelming support \u201d of the Republican base , Farage said that DeSantis is now a \u201c @ @ @ @

openly mocking the Florida governor at a rally in Pennsylvania over the weekend , dubbing him \u201c Ron DeSanctimonious \u201d .\nHowever , despite the nickname , Mr Trump did reveal that as a Florida resident , he voted for DeSantis on Tuesday .\nFor Trump , the evening was a mixed bag in terms of endorsements .\nWhile MAGA candidates such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nVance in Ohio , Katie Britt in

Democrats .\nDemocratic governor candidate Katie Hobbs is said to have a slight lead over Republican candidate Kari Lake , but officials are now claiming there are roughly 622,455 ballots left to be counted .\nAnd that number keeps getting bigger , as various and sundry boxes of votes keep \u2018 turning up.\n\u2019 For the average lay person , it \u2019 s almost impossible to know what \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are furious , and aloof election officials have given them no reason to allay those fears .\nTwo days have passed since polls closed in Arizona and unsurprisingly , election officials in the state have failed to provide voters with the final results of numerous highly contested races .\nAs of this article \u2019 s publication , none of Arizona \u2019 s contested statewide races have been called for any of their respective candidates .\nWith 70 percent of votes tabulated , Democrat Katie Hobbs leads her Republican rival Kari Lake in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while Democrat Mark Kelly leads Republican Blake Masters by a little less than 95,000 .\nThe races for Arizona Attorney General and Secretary of State also remain up in the air , with both still too close to call .\nSEE ALSO : Arizona : Democrat-run Elections Descend Into Turmoil As Voting Machines Mysteriously Malfunction According to the Associated Press , there are approximately 600,000 ballots \u2014 roughly a quarter of all those cast \u2014 that have yet to be tabulated as of Thursday afternoon , with a large segment of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most populous county , Maricopa .\nOn Wednesday morning , Maricopa officials estimated that there are \u201c more than 400K ballots left to count , \u201d with the locality receiving \u201c 275K early ballots on Election Day.\n\u201d The chairman of Maricopa \u2019 s Board of Supervisors Bill Gates has since told a CNN reporter on Thursday that the county doesn \u2019 t expect to have all of their votes finalized until \u201c early next week.\n\u201d The delayed counting in Maricopa comes on top of the county \u2019 s Election Day fiasco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 percent of Maricopa \u2019 s voting locations stopped working due to a \u201c printer issue.\n\u201d Local officials have since issued a public apology for their gross incompetence , saying in a statement that they are \u201c confident in the work still to be done to count every vote securely and accurately.\n\u201d But the problems witnessed throughout Arizona this week are hardly exclusive to the 2022 midterms .\nEarlier this year , it took two days for election officials to determine that Kari Lake had won her race to become Arizona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described by the New York Post , \u201c [ e ] arly election results showing only mail ballots received before Election Day \u201d had given the advantage to Lake \u2019 s chief opponent , Karrin Taylor Robson .\nLake \u2019 s victory was only realized after Maricopa County had released results from \u201c thousands of mail ballots \u201d that were dropped off at voting locations on Election Day .\nSimilar delays in election results were also notable in the 2020 presidential contest between former President Donald Trump and then-candidate Joe Biden .\nWhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Fox News prematurely called the state for Biden , most of the race \u2019 s final vote tallies weren \u2019 t officially known until a week later While countries with tens of millions of citizens , such as France and Brazil , are able to tabulate nationwide election results within 24 hours , the Grand Canyon State has continued to disrespect its voters by repeatedly leaving them in limbo and turning what \u2019 s supposed to be Election Day into \u201c election season.\n\u201d International election observers have regularly pointed to delayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs of incompetent election administration , and although that doesn \u2019 t mean there was impropriety in this year \u2019 s Arizona elections , the failure to tabulate votes in a timely and efficient manner does nothing but undermine voters \u2019 confidence in the electoral process .\nMuch like their counterparts in Washington , D.C. , Arizona \u2019 s Republican leaders such as Gov .\nDoug Ducey have had numerous chances over the past two years to resolve delayed vote tabulations ; and at every available opportunity , they have simply chosen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many Arizona Republicans see a leader who tackles challenging issues rather than runs from them .\nAnd given what the public has witnessed over the past two years , it sure looks like the state could use

for months about the epic downfall of crypto-exchange company FTX and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried , their focus will be primarily on the billions lost , the mismanagement of funds , the fraud inherent in yield farming and the alleged betrayal of investor trust .\nThis is a tale as old as time and not anything surprising .\nWhat many in the mainstream are missing , though , is Fried \u2019 s attachments to the World Economic Foundation , various global elitists and his avid sermonizing of the tenets of \u201c effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the tenets of Klaus Schwab \u2019 s Stakeholder Capitalism agenda .\nThe WEF lists FTX as a corporate \u201c partner \u201d and participant , which means the company must meet the globalist organization \u2019 s standards for Stakeholder Capitalism , a socialist economic model which deconstructs the Adam Smith and Milton Friedman free market foundation .\nMilton Friedman argued that the only responsibility of business should be growth and profit ( within the boundaries of the law ) with the shareholders in mind .\nThe WEF insists that the Friedman philosophy must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealthy elites and corporations is to use profits as a tool for managing society ( the so-called \u201c stakeholders \u201d ) .\nIn other words , corporate leaders should become cultural and political leaders fulfilling greater ideological goals , all of them decidedly socialist/Marxist in origin .\nStakeholder Capitalism becomes a way to trick the public into investing their faith in corporate leadership because these companies are no longer simply \u201c in it for the money , \u201d they are in it for the survival of the world and the species , right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just mercantilists .\nThat kind of blind faith allows people to be taken advantage of in a big way .\nIt \u2019 s the same kind of faith once applied to kings and monarchies centuries ago , and it usually leads to various forms of feudalism .\nIn the WEF \u2019 s vision of the future , the average person will \u201c own nothing , have no privacy and be happy about it \u201d while corporate elites in partnership with governments micromanage all production , all distribution and all finance .\nAn ongoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model is ESG , a credit system in which loans are given to companies and individuals based on their ESG score , derived from how dedicated they are to globalist causes .\nIn the near future , if you don \u2019 t promote social justice ideology and support establishment climate change claims , then you might not be able to get a loan from the bank for your business .\nYou might not be able to get a mortgage loan for a new home .\nIn fact , you might not even be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FTX and Fried heavily relied on investment firms like BlackRock , which is a major component of the spread of ESG .\nThis may be why FTX regularly announced their devotion to climate and social justice projects , it kept them in the good graces of the ESG overlords .\nA key component of Stakeholder Capitalism is the need for a digital currency framework , which might explain the WEF \u2019 s interest in FTX as a partner .\nThe move to a cashless society is the next step necessary for the micro-management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dole out rewards or punishments based on ESG scoring .\nIt is an incremental top down implementation of a framework similar to China \u2019 s \u201c social credit system.\n\u201d The concept is being sold by the WEF and their corporate partners as way to create \u201c equity \u201d within the economy by incentivizing the redistribution of wealth

control posing as a charitable movement for the greater good .\nBut without the freedom to succeed and the freedom to fail , there can be no greater good .\nEvidence is mounting that the equity measures involved in Stakeholder Capitalism will actually erase wealth rather than create wealth .\nTo be sure , it would make the majority of people financially even \u2013 Instead of being equally rich , we will all suffer in equal poverty .\nThe downfall of FTX and Sam Blankman-Fried illustrates this problem with clarity .\nFried constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , engaging in a kind of corporate charity built on socialist guidelines and climate cultism , while at the same time draining client accounts .\nThe FTX profit strategy was based initially on taking advantage of imbalances in international crypto exchange rates ; a limited window for a quick cash grab rather than an idea for long term viability .\nIt also relied on the crypto market constantly reinventing the wheel with

are not qualified enough nor intelligent enough nor benevolent enough to mold society at large ; no one is that wise or experienced .\nBeyond that , the Stakeholder Capitalism ideology is rooted in

is a petri dish for the disease of Stakeholder Capitalism .\nIn the end , FTX and Fried are a warning to us all that business should be separate from politics and cultural moderation .\nThey are

\u0130stanbul \u2019 s fashionable and popular Beyo\u011flu district has hit the news headlines like the starting shot of a countdown to next year \u2019 s general elections \u2026 .\nThe AKP government was quick to point the finger at Kurdish terrorist groups , the PKK and its affiliate the PYD .\nThe Interior Minister S\u00fcleyman Soylu even said that the orders for the attack had come from Kobani , the Kurdish city in northern Syria just across the Turkish border .\nThe BBC summarised Sunday \u2019 s events as follows : \u201c At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 81 wounded in an explosion in a busy area of central Istanbul , Turkish authorities have said .\nThe blast happened at about 16:20 local time ( 13:20 GMT ) on Sunday [ , 13 November 2022 ] on a shopping street in the Taksim Square area .\nA suspect has now been arrested , the interior minister said .\nVice-President Fuat Oktay earlier said the blast was thought to be a terrorist attack carried out by a woman.\n\u201d On Monday morning ( 14 November 2022 ) , the Interior Minister Soylu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been sitting on a bench in the vicinity for about 40 minutes and that a few minutes after getting up to go the blast occurred , indicating that this woman had deposited an explosive device before disappearing in the ensuing crowd .\nSoylu then went on to say that the woman in question had been arrested and put into police custody .\nIn a remarkable twist of words , the Interior Minister Soylu took his allegations way beyond Kobani ( and Rojava ) and way across the Atlantic : \u201c We know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received the message given to us , and we know what the message was .\nWe do not accept the condolences of the American embassy , \u201d he said on CNN T\u00dcRK .\nFor his part , President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan ( whom I like to refer to as the Prez ) said the perpetrators would be punished while speaking at a news conference in Istanbul , before getting on a plane bound for the G20 Summit in Indonesia .\nBefore boarding , he condemned the blast as a \u201c vile attack \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terror \u201d was in the air .\nA Smell of Terror in the Air The Prez \u2019 s words did sound ominous indeed , saying to the Turkish public at home that there was now \u201c a smell of terror \u201d in the air .\nAnd the timing of this year \u2019 s Beyo\u011flu blast also seems rather interesting : a fortnight after the 99th anniversary of the Republic foundation ( 29 October ) and a few days after the commemoration of Atat\u00fcrk \u2018 s death ( 10 November ) , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s supreme leader was bound to leave the country in the able hands of his surrogates \u2013 the AKP machinery led by Soylu and the Justice Minister Bekir Bozda\u011f .\nThe former even personally fanning the flames of anti-Kurdish sentiment by referring to the city of Kobani and the PKK-PYD nexus .\nThese coincidences appear like history repeating itself .\nBack in early May 2013 , for instance , when two bomb attacks in the small city of Reyhanl\u0131 , on the Turco-Syrian border and known locally as \u201c little Syria , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. to meet President Obama ( 16 May 2013 ) , while in June 2015 , \u201c elections .\n.\n.\nproduced an unexpected outcome as voters appeared to oppose the one-party AKP rule and allowed the Kurdish their moment in the sun.\n\u201d This was the first-ever chink in the AKP \u2019 s armour : At the time , I wrote that the \u201c worst case scenario for Turkey would now undoubtedly be unsuccessful coalition negotiations that would end in early elections in 45 days \u2019 time \u201d .\nAs it turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countenance a return to the good old days of unlikely and unwieldy coalition governments and forced a re-run of the electoral contest on the strategic date of 1 November ( coinciding with the holiday period accompanying the annual celebrations of Republic Day on 29 October ) .\nAs it happens , 1 November also carries a special place in Turkey \u2019 s Kemalist mythology and historiography as Atat\u00fcrk and the then -provisional Ankara government abolished the Ottoman Sultanate on that day in 1922 .\nIn fact , the main opposition newspaper S\u00f6zc\u00fc carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day of th [ e ] election , reminding voters to keep Atat\u00fcrk and his deeds in mind while casting ballots .\nThe Prez and his AKP cohorts carried the day , winning a whopping 49.50 % of the popular vote .\nPeople were shocked and commentators lost for words , but two days before the momentous elections I told the business media company BNE IntelliNews that the AKP was likely to secure \u201c 45 % [ of the ] votes.\n\u201d The reasoning behind my prediction was clear , as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T ] he ruling AKP ha [ d ] made cunning use of the intervening not-quite five months [ June-November 2015 ] .\nThe Prez and [ his PM Ahmet Davuto\u011flu ] gave speech after speech admonishing voters to choose stability over insecurity .\nAnd , as if by happy coincidence , the terror threat posed by Kurdish nationalism and the PKK once again reared its ugly head forcing Turkey to take retaliatory military measures , inside the country as well as across the border on the grounds of the KRG in Northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next door \u2019 s not-so civil war in Syria managed to insert itself into Turkey \u2019 s frame as well , targeting the local Kurds and their political party the HDP .\nThe terror attacks in Suru\u00e7 ( 20 July 2015 ) and Ankara ( 10 October 2015 ) were quickly blamed on the Islamic State ( IS ) and led to a concerted government crackdown on sleeper cells in such diverse locations as Diyarbak\u0131r and Pendik .\nEven though the country \u2019 s Kurds and the HDP had been the primary targets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the main beneficiary was nevertheless the AKP .\nThe popular fear of terror attacks had inspired Turkey \u2019 s voting public to opt for continuity over change , to trust the Prez and his AKP machinery to defeat the terrorists \u2013 whatever ideological shape or form they might take .\nFor , prior to November , 1st , \u201c Tayyip Erdogan spoke [ over and again ] about the fact that the PKK and its Syrian ally the PYD were the same as the Caliph and his IS [ commonly known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d The \u201c smell of terror \u201d in the air had convinced a majority of the Turkish electorate to vote for stability over insecurity in 2015 , thereby assuring a landslide return to power of the AKP .\nAt the time , I termed this expectedly unexpected outcome , \u2018 Turkey \u2019 s November Surprise , \u2019 which secured a clear mandate for a post-Kemalist century .\nThe post-Kemalist century seems set to continue its course , after all the AKP establishment has over the past years successfully dismantled nearly all of Atat\u00fcrk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition is today equally at ease in using an Islamic rhetoric to appeal to the Turkish public \u2013 the opposition Mayor of \u0130stanbul being all but an Islamist wolf in sheep \u2019 s clothing .\nThe economic crisis of the past years , however , seems to cast doubt on the electoral viability of the Prez and his AKP henchmen .\nAnd that is where the sudden revival of a real or imagined or manufactured terror threat appears highly significant .\nWill terror threats and/or attacks continue into the coming year , thereby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in violently suppressing either Kurdish and/or Islamist terrorists ?\n!\nThat seems to be Erdo\u011fan \u2019 s hope , as his above-quoted words uttered before leaving the country seem to indicate .\nI would argue that his insinuation that the public will now once again have to learn how to live with the \u201c smell of terror \u201d in the air all but denotes that his personal instincts indicate that the coming weeks and months will witness news cycles filled with stories about thwarted terror attacks and \u2018 neutralized \u2019 terrorists on home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the esteemed New York Times seems to toe the party line in this context , saying that the \u201c Turkish state has been at war for decades with Kurdish militants based in the country \u2019 s southeast .\n.\n.\nAnd jihadists who belonged to or were inspired by the Islamic State.\n\u201d Following Turkey \u2019 s November Surprise , the country seems to have been rather free of serious terror attacks \u2013 between 2011 and 17 , the country \u201c was targeted 87 times by 9 different terror organizations.\n\u201d The original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2016 , targeting a tourist group on \u0130stiklal Caddes\u0131 , when a suicide bomber was able to kill 4 Israeli nationals and injure 36 other bystanders .\nNow , more than six years later , another Beyo\u011flu blast has reawakened public fear in Turkey .\nBefore boarding his Indonesia-bound plane , the Prez told reporters that \u201c [ e ] fforts to make Turkey and the Turkish nation surrender by terror will not reach their aim today , as they did not in the past.\n\u201d This determination all but shows that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the AKP is more than ready to tackle any configuration of PKK-PYD-ISIS terrorists ( apparently bent on securing an easy electoral victory for the Prez in the significant centenary year of the Turkish Republic \u2019 s foundation ) .\nFor the AKP establishment feels that only success in next year \u2019 s elections is possible and necessary , necessary \u201c in order to achieve \u201d the AKP \u2019 s \u201c very own Hedef 2023 , as [ the party ] named [ its ] manifesto containing practical goals and targets \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prerequisites for achieving the unspoken aim of the transformation of the Turkish nation into a state once again beholden to the religion of Islam and regulated by Sharia law on the centenary of the foundation of the Republic of Turkey , \u201d as I have written last July .\nWill the Prez \u2019 s plans work again this time around ?\nWill 2023 see a re-run of 2015 ?\nAnd will a possible AKP victory lead to re-definition of the Turkish along Sharia line ?\n*** 21WIRE special contributor Dr. Can Erimtan is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to live in

generated in the wake of the referenda held last September in the regions of the Donbass , it became necessary to get some clarity on the legal issues surrounding this event .\nA graduate of Harvard Law School , Dr. Alfred de Zayas served as the first UN Independent Expert on the Promotion of a Democratic and Equitable International Order , appointed by the United Nations Human Rights Council ( 2012-18 ) .\nHe worked with the United Nations from 1981 to 2003 as a senior lawyer with the Office of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Secretary of the UN Human Rights Committee , and the Chief of Petitions .\nQ : What is your analysis of the predicament facing Russian-speaking minorities living in the Donbass regions in the wake of the events of the Maidan ?\nCould the actions of the Ukrainian government these past eight years be constitutive of an attempt to commit genocide on these populations ?\nAlfred de Zayas : The Russian population in Donbass certainly had reason to feel threatened in the light of the virulence of the anti-Russian rhetoric by the leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation adopted by the putsch-Parliament .\nThe level of hatred expressed by politicians and media certainly constituted \u201c hate speech \u201d and violated article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ( ICCPR ) , which prohibits both propaganda for war and incitement to hatred and discrimination .\nThe shelling of population centers in Donbas 2014-2022 entailed war crimes and crimes against humanity , but did not amount to genocide for purposes of the 1948 Genocide Convention .\nWhile Art .\n2 of 1948 of the Genocide Convention has 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genocide .\nIt is wiser to avoid hyperbole .\nWar crimes and crimes against humanity under articles 7 and 8 of the Statute of Rome are bad enough .\nThe right to speak one \u2019 s language is protected in articles 2 and 27 of the ICCPR .\nIt is also protected in articles 2 and 15 of the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights ( ICESCR ) and numerous UN resolutions .\nMoreover , it constitutes a legitimate exercise of the right of freedom of expression under article 19 ICCPR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles 19 and 27 ICCPR .\nMoreover , Ukraine is in violation of common article 1 of the ICCPR and ICESCR , which stipulates the right of self-determination of ALL peoples , necessarily including the Russian populations of Crimea and Donbas .\nArt .\n1 reads as follows : \u201c 1 .\nAll peoples have the right of self-determination .\nBy virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic , social and cultural development .\n2 .\nAll peoples may , for their own ends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources without prejudice to any obligations arising out of international economic co-operation , based upon the principle of mutual benefit , and international law .\nIn no case may a people be deprived of its own means of subsistence .\n3 .\nThe States Parties to the present Covenant , including those having responsibility for the administration of Non-Self-Governing and Trust Territories , shall promote the realization of the right of self-determination , and shall respect that right , in conformity with the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations.\n\u201d Q @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirit of the UN Charter as it sought to engage in diplomacy rather than succumb to the calls of those advocating for immediate military intervention as early as 2014-15 ?\nAlfred de Zayas : The Russian Federation spent three decades articulating its political will to pursue international cooperation and friendly relations with all countries , as envisaged in General Assembly Resolution 2625 .\nIt made valid overtures and concrete proposals for cooperation and building a joint European house based on sovereign equality and comprehensive national security .\nIt is a great loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s peace initiatives were not taken up by the US and NATO and that promises made in 1989-91 by US Secretary of State James Baker and others were not kept .\nThe one chance to agree on nuclear disarmament as foreseen in article 6 of the Non Proliferation Treaty , the one chance to implement conventional disarmament and reorient the world toward development and peace , was thrown away by President Bill Clinton when he approved the eastern expansion of NATO , a grave breach of trust , a needless provocation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) of the UN Charter , which prohibits not only the use of force , but also the threat of the use of force .\nAfter the Maidan coup d \u2019 \u00e9tat and the Ukrainian bombardment of the Donbas , the Russian Federation spent 8 years trying to solve the dispute by peaceful means as required under art .\n2 ( 3 ) of the UN Charter .\nThe Minsk agreements were valid and moderate and would have led to durable peace , if implemented by Ukraine .\nThe continued shelling of Donbass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , constituted repeated violations by Ukraine of Art .\n2 ( 4 ) of the Charter .\nIt is the ultima irratio to wage war on a hapless civilian population to prevent the exercise of their right of self-determination .\nAll Russian attempts at peaceful negotiation in the context of OSCE and the Normandy Format were ignored .\nAs late as December 2021 Russia put on the table the drafts of two treaties that would have been the basis of a fruitful dialogue pursuant to article 2 ( 3 ) of the UN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejected these peaceful overtures .\nQ : How does the argument of self-determination behind the recent referenda reconcile itself with the outcome in the case of Catalonia ?\nAlfred de Zayas : Article 1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is clear \u2013 ALL peoples have the right of self-determination \u2013 not only formerly colonial peoples .\nThis includes Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , Slovenia , Croatia , Kosovo .\nIt also includes the Catalans , the Crimeans , the Donbass population , the peoples of Nagorno Karabakh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of self-determination are PEOPLES \u2013 duty-bearers are States , which do NOT have a prerogative to grant or deny self-determination .\nOf course self-determination is not co-terminous with secession .\nAccording to the doctrine of internal self-determination , a people has a right to exercise it through internal self-determination in the form of autonomous status ( as envisaged in the Minsk agreements ) .\nIdeally self-determination should be preceded by reliable referenda , organized and monitored by the United Nations , as was the case in Timor Leste , Sudan and Ethiopia/Eritrea .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ peoples when it failed to organize referenda in 1991 , when Ukraine unilaterally seceded from the Soviet Union , or at the latest following the unconstitutional coup d \u2019 \u00e9tat against the democratically elected President of Ukraine Victor Yanukovych .\nQ : Did the ICJ open a pandora box with its 2010 decision bearing on the legality of Kosovo \u2019 s unilateral declaration of independence ?\nAlfred de Zayas : I would NOT call it a Pandora \u2019 s box at all .\nIt represents a reaffirmation of Article 1 of the ICCPR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decolonization of Africa and Asia was mandated \u2013 self-determination being one of the pillars of the UN Charter , and incorporated in numerous Security Council and General Assembly

by former US National Security Advisor and notorious Iran-hawk John Bolton , that weapons are being provided to those carrying out the latest regime change attempt taking place against Tehran , should come as little surprise .\nBeginning on the 16th of September , less than 24 hours after Iran had joined the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation \u2013 an alliance intended to foster political , economic and military development in Eurasia \u2013 protests that initially started in response to the death of Mahsa Amini , a 22-year old Iranian woman who passed away suddenly following an interaction with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would rapidly escalate into violent riots that quickly swept the Islamic Republic .\nThe sudden , violent nature of these riots , and their coordinated coverage by Western media , bore all the trademarks of a CIA-orchestrated colour revolution , which would later be confirmed as such by the involvement of Masih Alinejad , a US Agent who previously held a meeting with former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo \u2013 like John Bolton , another long-time supporter of regime change in Iran .\nIndeed , the violent overthrow of Iranian leaderships has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the MI6 and CIA-orchestrated Operation Ajax would see then-Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh deposed following his decision to nationalise Iran \u2019 s vast oil reserves .\nHis replacement , the Western-backed Shah Pahlavi , would himself be overthrown in the 1979 Islamic Revolution , which saw the anti-American and anti-Zionist Ayatollah Khomeini come to power , the Islamic Republic remaining a steadfast foe of the West ever since .\nBolton \u2019 s admission that arms are being provided to the \u2018 Iranian opposition \u2019 however , has a much more recent historical usage .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling for government reform would quickly escalate into violent riots that soon swept the African state .\nWith weapons provided by the CIA and MI6 and the cover of a NATO-imposed No Fly Zone , terrorists would overrun the country in the space of eight months , with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi \u2013 whose planned \u2018 Gold Dinar \u2019 currency had triggered the regime change operation \u2013 being lynched in a Sirte street in October of that year , his once thriving nation being reduced to a lawless wasteland .\nLikewise in March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erupt in Syria , when terrorists armed by the US , Britain , Israel and Saudi Arabia took control of vast swathes of the Arab Republic , the casus belli being Bashar al-Assad \u2019 s 2009 refusal to allow US-ally Qatar to build a pipeline through his country , an arrangement that would have undermined his relationship with key ally Russia .\nUnlike Libya however , Damascus has been able to withstand this regime change attempt for the past 11 years , with Assad remaining in power to this day .\nThis was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iranian intervention in June 2013 , with both Damascus and Tehran sharing a common defence agreement , and a further Russian air campaign that began in September 2015 , again at the request of the Damascus , and which allowed the Syrian Arab Army to retake areas that had fallen under terrorist control , such as the key city of Aleppo .\nThis is where grim possibilities come into play in the similarities between Libya and Syria and what is currently taking place in Iran .\nShould the current disturbances eventually escalate into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Iran , the regime change lobby will undoubtedly move towards calls for a Libya-style \u2018 humanitarian intervention \u2019 to take place against the Islamic Republic .\nPossessing some of the most advanced air defence systems in the Middle East , any attempt to close Iran \u2019 s skies would undoubtedly lead to Tehran \u2019 s missile capabilities being put to use on Washington \u2019 s regional allies such as Israel and Saudi Arabia , turning a proxy war into a major regional conflict .\nIndeed , Iran \u2019 s capabilities in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2020 , when a retaliatory missile strike was launched against the Ain Al-Asad US airbase in neighbouring Iraq , in response to the drone strike assassination of Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani .\nEven the scenario of a major regional conflict however , would be before even Iran \u2019 s own allies decided to become involved .\nIn March 2021 , a 25-year cooperation deal was signed between Iran and Nuclear-armed China in order to further relations in regards to the development of energy infrastructure .\nFollowing the Russian intervention in Ukraine earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ties , with Vladimir Putin paying a visit to the Iranian capital in July .\nThe possibility that either Beijing or Moscow may decide to intervene should Western military action be taken against Iran is distinct , and therefore it is not just in Iran \u2019 s interest that the current disturbances are quelled as quickly as possible , but the entire world \u2019 s .\nSEE MORE IRAN NEWS AT :

coal simultaneously soaring and even forcing closure of major industrial plants such as chemicals or aluminum or steel .\nThe Biden Administration and EU have insisted that all is because of Putin and Russia \u2019 s military actions in Ukraine .\nThis is not the case .\nThe energy crisis is a long-planned strategy of western corporate and political circles to dismantle industrial economies in the name of a dystopian Green Agenda .\nThat has its roots in the period years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launched its military action in Ukraine .\nIn January , 2020 on the eve of the economically and socially devastating covid lockdowns , the CEO of the world \u2019 s largest investment fund , Larry Fink of Blackrock , issued a letter to Wall Street colleagues and corporate CEOs on the future of investment flows .\nIn the document , modestly titled \u201c A Fundamental Reshaping of Finance \u201d , Fink , who manages the world \u2019 s largest investment fund with some $ 7 trillion then under management , announced a radical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c go green.\n\u201d In his closely-followed 2020 letter Fink declared , \u201c In the near future \u2013 and sooner than most anticipate \u2013 there will be a significant re-allocation of capital\u2026Climate risk is investment risk.\n\u201d Further he stated , \u201c Every government , company , and shareholder must confront climate change.\n\u201d In a separate letter to Blackrock investor clients , Fink delivered the new agenda for capital investing .\nHe declared that Blackrock will exit certain high-carbon investments such as coal , the largest source of electricity for the USA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Blackrock would screen new investment in oil , gas and coal to determine their adherence to the UN Agenda 2030 \u201c sustainability.\n\u201d Fink made clear the world \u2019 s largest fund would begin to disinvest in oil , gas and coal .\n\u201c Over time , \u201d Fink wrote , \u201c companies and governments that do not respond to stakeholders and address sustainability risks will encounter growing skepticism from the markets , and in turn , a higher cost of capital.\n\u201d He added that , \u201c Climate change has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospects\u2026 we are on the edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance.\n\u201d From that point on the so-called ESG investing , penalizing CO2 emitting companies like ExxonMobil , has become all the fashion among hedge funds and Wall Street banks and investment funds including State Street and Vanguard .\nSuch is the power of Blackrock .\nFink was also able to get four new board members in ExxonMobil committed to end the company \u2019 s oil and gas business .\nThe January 2020 Fink letter was a declaration of war by big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BlackRock was a founding member of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ( the TCFD ) and is a signatory of the UN PRI\u2014 Principles for Responsible Investing , a UN-supported network of investors pushing zero carbon investing using the highly-corrupt ESG criteria\u2014Environmental , Social and Governance factors into investment decisions .\nThere is no objective control over fak data for a company \u2019 s ESG .\nAs well Blackrock signed the Vatican \u2019 s 2019 statement advocating carbon pricing regimes .\nBlackRock in 2020 also joined Climate Action 100 , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US $ 40 trillion .\nWith that fateful January 2020 CEO letter , Larry Fink set in motion a colossal disinvestment in the trillion-dollar global oil and gas sector .\nNotably , that same year BlackRock \u2019 s Fink was named to the Board of Trustees of Klaus Schwab \u2019 s dystopian World Economic Forum , the corporate and political nexus of the Zero Carbon UN Agenda 2030 .\nIn June 2019 , the World Economic Forum and the United Nations signed a strategic partnership framework to accelerate the implementation of the 2030 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform which includes Agenda 2030 \u2019 s 17 Sustainable Development Goals .\nIn his 2021 CEO letter , Fink doubled down on the attack on oil , gas and coal .\n\u201c Given how central the energy transition will be to every company \u2019 s growth prospects , we are asking companies to disclose a plan for how their business model will be compatible with a net-zero economy , \u201d Fink wrote .\nAnother BlackRock officer told a recent energy conference , \u201c where BlackRock goes , others will follow.\n\u201d In just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 1 trillion has exited investment in oil and gas exploration and development globally .\nOil extraction is an expensive business and cut-off of external investment by BlackRock and other Wall Street investors spells the slow death of the industry .\nEarly in his then-lackluster Presidential bid , Biden had a closed door meeting in late 2019 with Fink who reportedly told the candidate that , \u201c I \u2019 m here to help.\n\u201d After his fateful meeting with BlackRock \u2019 s Fink , candidate Biden announced , \u201c We are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December 2020 , even before Biden was inaugurated in January 2021 , he named BlackRock Global Head of Sustainable Investing , Brian Deese , to be Assistant to the President and Director of the National Economic Council .\nHere , Deese , who played a key role for Obama in drafting the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015 , has quietly shaped the Biden war on energy .\nThis has been catastrophic for the oil and gas industry .\nFink \u2019 s man Deese was active in giving the new President Biden a list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Order beginning day one in January 2021 .\nThat included closing the huge Keystone XL oil pipeline that would bring 830,000 barrels per day from Canada as far as Texas refineries , and halting any new leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ( ANWR ) .\nBiden also rejoined the Paris Climate Accord that Deese had negotiated for Obama in 2015 and Trump cancelled .\nThe same day , Biden set in motion a change of the so-called \u201c Social Cost of Carbon \u201d that imposes a punitive $ 51 a ton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry .\nThat one move , established under purely executive-branch authority without the consent of Congress , is dealing a devastating cost to investment in oil and gas in the US , a country only two years before that was the world \u2019 s largest oil producer .\nEven worse , Biden \u2019 s aggressive environmental rules and BlackRock ESG investing mandates are killing the US refinery capacity .\nWithout refineries , it doesn \u2019 t matter how many barrels of oil you take from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve .\nIn the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US has shut down some 1 million barrels a day of gasoline and diesel refining capacity , some due to covid demand collapse , the fastest decline in US history .\nThe shutdowns are permanent .\nIn 2023 an added 1.7 million bpd of capacity is set to close as a result of BlackRock and Wall Street ESG disinvesting and Biden regulations .\nCiting the heavy Wall Street disinvestment in oil and the Biden anti-oil policies , the CEO of Chevron in June 2022 declared that he doesn \u2019 t believe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nLarry Fink , Board member of Klaus Schwab \u2019 s World Economic Forum , is joined by the EU whose President of the EU Commission , the notoriously corrupt Ursula von der Leyen left the WEF Board in 2019 to become EU Commission head .\nHer first major act in Brussels was to push through the EU Zero Carbon Fit for 55 agenda .\nThat has imposed major carbon taxes and other constraints on oil , gas and coal in the EU well before the February 2022 Russian actions in Ukraine .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ ESG agenda in the Biden administration and the EU Zero Carbon madness is creating the worst energy and inflation crisis in history .\nF.

Reset: Realism Returns to the Fore", "content": "The following is an excerpt from the cover story for Issue # 195 of New Dawn Magazine\u2026 At some point in the future , we may look back at 2022 at one of the most consequential years of young 21st century history .\nThis was the year that has shaken the international system to its core , and has possibly brought us closer to the brink of Armageddon than any point since the Cuban Missile Crisis .\nIndeed , the unthinkable has happened : a major war breaking out on the fringe of Europe , followed the largest combined economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancel \u2019 Russia , a country that happens to be the world \u2019 s largest overall commodities producer and a nuclear superpower to boot .\nFor the western world , things have gotten pretty tumultuous as a result , with global supply chains fraying at the seams , and with energy , fuel , and food prices continuing to spiral out of control , pushing tens of millions into fuel poverty this winter .\nAs a result , previous assumptions regarding the stability and resilience of modern western advanced economies have now come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world order led by soft power and an ephemeral green solar and wind-powered technocracy , we are suddenly faced with a new reality : hard power has returned to the fore of international relations .\nWe should have seen it coming .\nAfter two years of global domestic social and financial upheavals resulting from the COVID-19 pseudo pandemic , geopolitics has come roaring back to retake centre stage in this 21st century epoch .\nFollowing Russia \u2019 s military intervention in Ukraine , suddenly , the focus immediately shifted away from bio-surveillance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to military formations , and a torrent of western sanctions against Russia .\nAn economic and hyper-inflationary fallout has ensued .\nUnfortunately for the collective West , this economic war hasn \u2019 t ruined Russia in a way that mainstream punditry and politicians hoped it would .\nThe Russian ruble bounced back hitting record highs in recent months , while Russian oil and gas revenues have almost doubled from 2020-2021 .\nInstead , it \u2019 s the European and North American economies that have been devastated , with misinformed western consumers mostly miffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extortionate rates for petroleum , electricity , and gas to run their cars , heat their homes and power their grids .\nTalk of energy rationing and rolling blackouts have now become the norm throughout the G7 and EU blocs , as they brace themselves for a dark winter .\nDespite ample evidence to the contrary , politicians and pundits alike are still scapegoating Vladimir Putin for their own precarious economic position .\nIn general , for western governments , this latest episode has been perhaps the greatest own-goal in history .\nRather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stabilise global energy and agricultural markets , a gallant virtue-signalling West has instead opted to double down on their precarious stance by further tightening anti-Russian sanctions , as well as pursue even deeper commitments towards de-nulearisation and the not-so-green \u2018 Net Zero \u2019 carbon reduction agenda .\nBy blocking inbound energy supplies from the Nordstream and other Russian pipelines which supplied them with affordable and reliable gas and oil into the EU , Europe has painted itself into a very perilous corner .\nAt the core of the European economy is Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its basic energy requirements at an affordable price , then it will surely spell disaster for both Germany and EU .\nAnd that damage will reverberate even further afield .\nWhy would one of the world \u2019 s leading economies choose to commit economic suicide ?\nCertainly not merely to support the new face of global victimisation in Ukraine ?\nBut it \u2019 s not just a case of the western countries making an epic blunder here .\nFundamentally , the current economic chaos may also be running its course by design , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preconditions for Klaus Schwab \u2019 s infamous Great Reset agenda .\nWe \u2019 re talking here about the deindustrialisation of the West , all in the name of reaching their UN Sustainable Development Goals , supposedly in order to save the world from the scourge of climate change .\nTo fully understand what is happening in Europe , Ukraine , Russia and North America \u2013 and why , one must take into account the historical period known as the interwar period which preceded the Second World War , and the American-led liberal internationalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this important phase in globalisation will help us see past the well-worn western talking point which claims that the current calamity is all about \u2018 Russia \u2019 s war of aggression \u2019 , and that the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance ( NATO ) is a benign defensive organisation and the last bulwark against the imperialist Russian hoards overrunning Europe from the east .\nRather , what we are witnessing is the continuation of long-range policy of the Anglo-American establishment designed to tame Germany \u2013 both economically and geopolitically \u2013 and thus to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Eurasia ( ie .\nthe Great Game 2.0 ) .\nMuch has been made of the fact that NATO members have reneged on previous promises not to expand eastward , but this fact alone does not reveal the full scope of NATO \u2019 s task and purpose .\nDocuments from the U.S. National Security Archive clearly show how in 1990 the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev had in fact agreed to German reunification with the West in part due to assurances made by U.S. envoy James Baker that NATO would not expand to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eastward \u201d was Baker \u2019 s famous pronouncement .\nThere were other such verbal and diplomatic assurances made by the West over the years , but nothing was ever formalised in a written treaty or accord .\nThis aspect of the story is only part of a much larger geopolitical equation .\nOne of the biggest myths in modern western narrative is the belief that reason NATO exists is to protect and defend Europe from the former Soviet , and now Russian , threat from the east .\nIn reality , the true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first Secretary General , Britain \u2019 s Lord Hastings Lionel Ismay , who famously quipped that the purpose of the alliance was \u201c to keep the Russians out , the Americans in , and the Germans down.\n\u201d In essence , this was , and still is the main Anglo-American objective in their management of European affairs .\nA key part of the post WWII arrangement for Europe was that the United States and its allies would provide the security for Europe , and that countries like Germany \u2018 would not be burdened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military and could then focus on their economic development as part of the largest project of rebuilding a post-war Europe which was organised through the U.S. Marshall Plan .\nIn return for their cooperation , German industry was then given unfettered access to a new and burgeoning U.S. consumer market .\nThis very same \u2018 peace dividend \u2019 was also adopted for post-war Japan\u2026 Read the full

many former and current high-ranking officials , politicians , businessmen , and oligarchs have moved to safety abroad \u2013 mainly to the EU .\nThe mass flight of Ukrainian elites started even prior to the armed conflict .\nOn February 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukrainian president \u2019 s parliamentary faction ( Servant of the People ) suddenly went missing .\nHad MPs not been banned from leaving the country the very next day , others would have definitely joined them .\nMeanwhile , former officials and oligarchs enjoyed more freedom to move around .\nAccording to the Italian newspaper La

those enjoying high life in the middle of the war .\nThe Cap-Ferrat villa once belonging to King Leopold II of Belgium was bought by the richest Ukrainian oligarch Rinat Akhmetov .\nHis neighbors are

creators of the report , some of the weapons are sold on the black market .\nAs US Marine Corps veteran Andy Milburn said , \u201c I can tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things are not getting there .\nDrones ,

is being stolen along the way and never reaches the soldiers .\nAt the same time , Ukrainian MPs recently gave themselves a 70 % pay raise .\nThe author of the piece argues that billions of dollars from the US and the EU have been diverted .\nA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western funds never reaching the front : \u201c Imagine telling an American soldier that we are using our personal cars in the war , and we \u2019 re also responsible for paying for repairs and fuel .\nWe \u2019 re buying our own body armor and helmets .\nWe don \u2019 t have observation tools or cameras , so soldiers have to pop their heads out to see what \u2019 s coming , which means at any moment , a rocket or tank can tear their heads off.\n\u201d Samantha Morris , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to the theft of medical supplies and the overall corruption : \u201c The lead doctor at the military base in Sumy has ordered medical supplies from and for the military at different points in time , and he has had 15 trucks of supplies completely disappear , \u201d she said .\nThe doctors couldn \u2019 t even set up courses for medical assistants until a friend of the Sumy Region governor interceded .\nCNN talked to a retired US colonel who said that Ukrainian troops are short on supplies .\nSmall arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a lot more are under the control of private organizations \u2013 more concerned about stealing money than saving the lives of their compatriots .\nAs Stephen Myers , a former member of the US Department of State Advisory Committee on International Economic Policy , insisted , \u201c There is little to prevent a field commander from diverting some of the equipment to buyers , aka the Russians , the Chinese , the Iranians or whomever , while claiming the equipment and weapons were destroyed\u2026 \u201d Thousands of tons of humanitarian aid is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine ( NABU ) proved that the head of the Office of the President , Andrey Yermak , his deputy Kirill Tymoshenko , the head of the Servant of the People party , David Arakhamiya , and his friend Vemir Davityan were behind the large-scale theft of humanitarian aid in Zaporozhye Region .\nZaporozhye officials Starukh , Nekrasova , Sherbina , and Kurtev only superficially carried out the task of distributing aid .\nIn six months , they organized the theft of 22 sea containers , 389 railway cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sold in ATB and Selpo \u2013 supermarkets owned by Gennady Butkevich and Vladimir Kostelman , respectively .\nOf course , Tymoshenko , Nekrasova and Davityan all became \u2018 refugees \u2019 and found asylum in Vienna .\nAdmittedly , not everyone is on the run .\nAndrey Yarmolsky , the scandalous former deputy head of the Volyn regional administration \u2013 accused of stealing humanitarian aid , supplying defective bulletproof vests , and illegally moving men out of the country \u2013 was promoted .\nHe now works for the National Security and Defense Council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe Telegraph reports that \u201c some of the donated supplies later made their way onto the hospitals \u2019 pharmacy shelves : priced , and listed for sale.\n\u201d Health workers appropriate medicine , bandages , and medical equipment , and resell them to patients for whom they were intended to be free , the article says .\nA similar story was told by the aforementioned doctor Dr. Morris : \u201c I got a call from a nurse at a military hospital in Dnipro .\nShe said the president of the hospital had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and that the wounded soldiers being treated there had no pain relief .\nShe begged us to hand-deliver pain medications to her .\nShe said she would hide them from the hospital president so that they \u2019 d reach the soldiers .\nBut who can you trust ?\nWas the hospital president really stealing the medications , or was she trying to con us into giving her pain medications for her to sell or use ?\nWho knows .\nEveryone is lying.\n\u201d War for some , Gucci for others Enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used by corrupt Ukrainian officials for personal enrichment and to acquire luxury goods .\nIn a recently busted corruption scheme , Odessa customs smuggled shirts , backpacks , sports shoes , belts , and other luxury items by Givenchy , Gucci , Polo , Dolce & Gabbana , Michael Kors , Chanel , Louis Vuitton , and Armani under the guise of army equipment .\nThe documents , declaring the cargo as \u201c for the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine , \u201d were signed by the acting head of the Odessa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MP Aleksandr Dubinsky , this is a common theft scheme .\n\u201c The work of the customs is unsatisfactory because while some are fighting at the front , others are making money under the guise of their customs uniforms , \u201d the parliamentarian said .\nTo take another example , in May 2022 , Western countries abolished customs duties for Ukraine .\nWithin a week , over 14,000 passenger cars were imported into the country .\nAs the deputy minister of infrastructure , Mustafa Nayem , commented , \u201c Considering we \u2019 re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Poland , Slovakia , and Romania were quite surprised by this fast-paced upgrade to our vehicle fleet.\n\u201d As they go about acquiring luxurious clothes and cars , the thieves are also taking care to withdraw capital from Ukraine .\nAccording to the Bureau of Economic Security of Ukraine , Ukraine \u2019 s budget is missing UAH 4.5 billion worth of taxes from agrotraders : \u201c In August-September 2022 , almost 12 million tons of grain crops and oil estimated at UAH 137 billion were exported through the customs territory of Ukraine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tons were exported by fake companies existing only on paper.\n\u201d Moreover , \u201c most of the non-resident companies to which grain is exported are high-risk and involved in criminal investigations.\n\u201d Is this the \u2018 grain deal \u2019 that the global community is actively cheering ?\nIt looks like Ukrainian fraudsters are corrupting not just their own country , but foreign states as well .\nAnd this is just one example out of many .\nWhen the Surkis brothers left Ukraine , they took $ 17 million with them .\nBut that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the \u2018 heroes of the Euromaidan \u2019 .\nAccording to former People \u2019 s Deputy of Ukraine Oleg Tsarev , after the outbreak of hostilities , leading Ukrainian politicians sent both their capital and their families abroad .\nHe mentions that the parents and relatives of Zelensky and his wife all left the country .\nHis predecessor , former President Pyotr Poroshenko , moved not just his children but also about a billion US dollars in cash to the UK .\nThe same applies to other major Ukrainian officials : former Minister of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Office of the President , Andrey Yermak , the second president of Ukraine , Leonid Kuchma , former Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk , and many others all took their families and fortunes , estimated at around a billion dollars , out of the country .\nAnd that \u2019 s not to mention the numerous politically-affiliated oligarchs .\nScammers of smaller stature can \u201c individually join the EU \u201d as well .\nA system of bribery allows military-age males to leave the country .\nAccording to Izvestia , the fee is currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Ukrainian media also actively reports on

themselves as Christians , and even those who say they were baptised in the church will admit that they seldom attend church , and have since gradually drifted away from religion , and stopped believing in religious teachings and doctrines altogether .\nThe reasons for this are many , with some flagging church scandals and conservative positions on social issues .\nStill , this should be a point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s religious and political leadership\u2026 Less than half of people in England and Wales are Christian , the census has revealed , with both atheism and Islam making major gains .\nThe majority of people in both England and Wales are not Christian for the first time probably since the 7th century AD , data from the 2021 census published on Tuesday has revealed .\nAccording to the information released by Britain \u2019 s Office of National Statistics , both England and Wales have lost their status as majority-Christian nations , with only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England reporting themselves as being Christian , while only 43.6 per cent of the Welsh population now describe themselves as being adherents to a denomination of Christianity .\nWhile the faith still remains the plurality religion in both countries , it is the first time the total percentage of the population who are Christian has dropped below the 50 per cent mark in modern history , and most likely since the British isles were converted and moved away from Paganism 1,300 years ago .\nThe change is even more pronounced when viewed over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 46 per cent of those in England professing to be Christian comparing to 71 per cent in 2001 , just 20 years ago .\nMeanwhile , the percentage of people saying that they have \u201c no religion \u201d in both nations has spiked significantly , growing from around a quarter of the population of both countries in 2011 to over 37 per cent by the time of recording the census last year .\nIslam saw the next largest overall increase , growing in

Cryptocurrency", "content": "We are in a \u2018 Crypto Winter \u2019 .\nThere has been a huge decrease in the dollar value of all crypto currencies .\nEven those people who can barely unlock their phone , let alone invest in a DeFi protocol , have heard about the collapse in crypto currency price .\nIt is the perfect time to evaluate the landscape .\nIt may not be the bottom of the dip , but it is certainly a juncture for the industry .\nFrom here , many paths are open and thus we have a war for the future of crypto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the bottom up , assuming only a small amount of knowledge to try and clear the murky waters which swirl around the nubilous topic of crypto currency .\nNow ideas around digital money have been proposed and worked on since the inception of the electronic banking era .\nAlthough we have seen the idea of energy currency as far back as the time of Henry Ford1 and Buckminister Fuller , the cryptographic form of anonymity comes later .\nDavid Chaum in 1983 discussed Blind Signature Cryptography proposing a way that banks can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of special envelopes which hide the name of the payee , whilst still being auditable.2 In 1998 programmer Nick Szabo published his work on \u2018 Bit-Gold \u2019 .\nThis was one of the first proposals seeking to emulate a function of gold by digital means .\nHe proposed a sequence of puzzles , where the solution of one puzzle would form part of the next puzzle .\nOne could play along and try to solve puzzles first , to claim the bit-gold , by using a certain amount of computing power .\nInteresting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blog post asking : \u201c What makes it desirable ?\nWhy would I want to own proofs of wasted computational effort ?\n\u201d 3 The proof would be in the pudding .\nThen came Nakamoto .\nThe anonymous creator of Bitcoin proposed a \u201c purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash \u201d 4 .\nAmong many innovations bundled together into the Bitcoin protocol was decentralisation , the network being a voluntary system made up of the users themselves rather than users applying to a central authority .\nThis also takes away the cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitor users to prevent fraud .\nIn short , it is a trustless system : you don \u2019 t need to trust any other party , you can independently verify the transaction yourself .\nThis was a revolution in money \u2013 there hadn \u2019 t been a trustless form of money since the days of yore when gold was the medium of exchange .\nEven gold based systems usually required a monarch \u2019 s stamp to give authority to the coin proving that it wasn \u2019 t in some way alloyed or under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency was born , and it took the legacy banking system by surprise .\nIt took a couple of years for the network to become widely adopted .\nInitially being mined and transacted by a few nerds , the first recognised transaction of Bitcoin for real world goods was the now infamous 10,000 Bitcoin pizza in 2010.5 It would grow from there to be a currency of illegal online marketplaces like the Silk Road , busted in 2014 .\nYet by 2017 it was accepted by Japan as legal tender , with many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it became legal tender in El Salvador hailing a split from the US Dollar hegemony that the country had endured since the 1979 US backed coup and 15 years of civil war .\nBitcoin grew from a nascent bundle of technologies to a real world economic force , whilst maintaining much of its original form .\nThe legacy system of international financial control is a network of institutions including the IMF .\nThe International Monetary Fund issues debts to nation states ostensibly for investment .\nYet their long history , having been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geopolitical order , has been one of financial domination , by powerful vested interests , of poorer and weaker nations .\nThese victim states are forced by the IMF to de-regulate their economy , to allow vulture capitalists to move in and to allow the human and natural resources of a state to be plundered .\nAs such the IMF are not happy when the usually supplicant El Salvador tries to break away from their system of control and use an alternate currency .\nThey have repeatedly demanded that President Bukele rescind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tender and threaten various dire consequences if not.6 As yet , Bukele is holding on , with high ratings and support internally , despite the downturn in Bitcoin \u2019 s price .\nMonero is a privacy coin .\nConceived and issued in 2014 it was created to address some of the shortcomings in Bitcoin , namely in privacy .\nAs Bitcoin utilises a distributed ledger , its transaction history can be viewed by anybody viewing the blockchain .\nAlthough it is \u2018 pseudanonymous \u2019 , meaning that the blockchain only stores hashes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is possible to tie those IDs with real-life identity .\nMonero does the same job as Bitcoin in being digital cash , but it does so anonymously .\nThrough various technologies , Monero is transacted anonymously such that one can never decipher either user , the amount transacted or exactly when it took place .\nThe US tax office , the IRS , in 2020 offered a bounty of $ 625,000 to anyone who could crack Monero \u2019 s code.Yet it seems that Monero is too valuable for talented hackers as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is frustrated by a technology which truly sidelines their tax auditing capabilities .\nThe Bank of England too , over a hundred years old , is the creator and maintainer of the British Pound .\nThey like to keep a tight hold on economic policy \u2013 if you control the currency , to some degree , you can control the people .\nTraditionally fiat currencies were the playthings of rich and powerful families and legacy institutions .\nIt was they who could decide the values of currencies , how often and to whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are controlled .\nTherefore , a peer-to-peer currency such as Bitcoin or Monero , would allow people to transact outside this paradigm .\nBitcoin and cryptocurrency at large is therefore a threat to central banks .\nIt should come as no surprise then that the Bank of England has continually produced a stream of anti-crypto currency propaganda .\nThat is not to say , may I add , that there are not problems in the crypto currency world , we will address these soon .\nI argue though that the Bank of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and international institutions will all be jumping on the bandwagon right now , whilst their enemy is down .\nThe Biden White House put out a statement ahead of this week \u2019 s G20 calling for more regulation of crypto currency .\nFurthermore , U.S. Treasury secretary Janet Yellen said this week that the fall of FTX \u201c demonstrate [ s ] the need for more effective oversight of crypto currency markets.\n\u201d 15 There is , in my opinion , a wave of negative stories and media coverage of crypto currency at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divert that flood of libertarian economics into controlled and limited hangouts .\nThere is a presented dichotomy : dangerous and volatile crypto currency , then a solution ; government issued digital currency .\nAn example of this is Saudi central banks issuing a new blockchain-based token for cross border trades with the UAE.7 Here we have two brutal dictatorships , issuing a digital money laundering token and cashing in on the wave of crypto currency to make them both look good .\nWe will also turn to investigate these centrally controlled tools .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank of England \u2019 s latest statement on crypto currency .\nSir Jon Cunliffe is a Deputy Governor and Head of Financial Stability for the Bank of England .\nI \u2019 m sure he \u2019 s doing a great job , and we wouldn \u2019 t like to slander him .\nI would mention that the British pound \u2019 s value has slipped in free fall multiple times in 2022 .\nI would highlight that the Bank of England is printing money at record levels and that confidence in the currency is nearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have keys to the back-door to the pounds in each of our pockets and digital bank accounts , so we should be at least polite .\nSo Jon came out with a statement recently about crypto currency.8 The only prompting for the speech seems to be kicking crypto while it \u2019 s down .\nHe initially even admits that : \u201c even with the recent collapse crypto assets and crypto markets have not posed a systemic risk \u201d .\nSo far crypto currency does not have enough sway to cause ripples in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency sector today stands at around $ 1 trillion ; in comparison the USA government spent $ 7 trillion in 2021 .\nYet , Cunliffe still seeks to expand the remit of regulation into crypto currency .\nHere is the most telling statement : \u201c where we can find no way to mitigate and manage the risk to the extent necessary\u2026 we should not let activities proceed.\n\u201d He doesn \u2019 t tell us how they will stop the \u201c activities \u201d from proceeding .\nYet the \u201c we \u201d he mentions tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of financial regulation in the UK , the Bank of England , the Thatcher-created Financial Conduct Authority and the UK government .\nBut if all of those parties have a vested interest in legacy finance , which entails printing billions , handing it to big banks , gambling with it and patching up any major losses with taxpayer funds , can they be trusted ?\nThis is a model which has created a corrupt City of London , famous the world over for money laundering and financial crime .\nIt has meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value out of the UK economy .\nIt is a scheme of control and domination , which until crypto currency , was an inescapable system .\nIn seeking to do-down crypto currency , Jon , similarly to high level politicians , employs the slimy art of spin .\nHe variously groups Bitcoin among \u201c financial assets with no intrinsic value \u201d \u2013 which ignores the value case indicated by Henry Ford , as an energy currency .\nHe also ignores the cryptographic case outlined earlier , in transacting value outside of central control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other crypto currencies \u201c crypto-assets \u201d .\nIt can be viewed as an asset , yet Bitcoin \u2019 s own white paper mentions it is a form of \u201c cash \u201d in the first line .\nThey really don \u2019 t want people to view Bitcoin and others as a currency , for that isremit and their talons are dug in deep .\nIn fact , he never mentions \u2018 cyrptocurrency \u2019 in his speech , it is a carefully crafted piece .\nWhat he moves onto as the focus of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are technological means of arbitrage to allow the transaction into an asset which is pegged in value to a fiat currency .\nAh , they breathe a sigh of relief , if it is tied to one of their currencies of control , it is under their control .\nTherefore , when we learn that the \u201c The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision \u201d , which sounds like a fun place to hang out and sup brandy by the fire , intends on creating schema to regulate \u201c crypto assets \u201d we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks wish to hoover up any vestiges of an independent banking system in crypto currency by regulating and controlling stable coins .\nIf you wish to bring your crypto currency into the legacy banking system , cash in your Bitcoin for Euros for example , it will be under these new frameworks being forged in the vaults and crypts of Switzerland .\nIf you seek to transact outside of their systems of control , they will have to take stronger measures to stop you .\n\u201c If in fact you can \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t get in , then everybody is walking around with a Swiss Bank account in their pocket , \u201d \u2013 Barack Obama 9 So how did such a valuable proposition , banking outside of the legacy system , fall so far this year ?\nAt one time its proponents were all over the internet claiming crypto currency was headed \u2018 to the moon \u2019 .\nWell it is thanks to some notorious collapses in crypto companies .\nThis isn \u2019 t the first time the failure of a private company has caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency .\nMt.Gox was the biggest Bitcoin exchange in 2014 , handling over 70 % of Bitcoin transactions.10 When it was hacked and 850,000 Bitcoin were stolen the value of Bitcoin dropped from around $ 800 to a low of $ 250 per coin .\nYet this modern era of crypto currency collapse is not due to hacking .\nIt was due to scams .\nAlready in 2022 we had the collapse of Celsius , which I covered in July11 .\nIt had spent all of its investors \u2019 money on risky investments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself as a saving service .\nWhen there was a dip in crypto currency price , Celsius couldn \u2019 t tend its debts .\nThere was a \u2018 run on the bank \u2019 when investors tried to pull out their savings and the whole house of cards collapsed .\nIt had a contagion effect as the company rested on an arbitrage between Bitcoin and a dodgy stablecoin called Terra USD .\nWhen Terra couldn \u2019 t put up enough dollars to balance out their digital stablecoin issuance , they went under .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundredth of a cent and in reality you can \u2019 t cash out any Terra USD .\nYet they won \u2019 t be flushed and have launched Terra 2.0 and are attempting to revive their asset , even whilst Do Kwon , its creator is on the run .\nWe also have a similar case with Three Arrows Capital .\nThree Arrows was a hedge fund which utilised crypto currency to back its high-risk investment strategy .\nWhen , in June 2022 they couldn \u2019 t meet their margin calls , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virgin Islands .\nAnother victim of the 2022 bear market , said some commentators , but I allege they fell victim to the same expansive greed which brought about the 2008 financial crisis and are facets of the same ideology that is causing so much pain today .\nThis leads us to the second big collapse , the high profile collapse of FTX .\nA company run by Sam Bankman-Fried , whose mother Barbara Fried was a big fundraiser for the Democrat Party.12 In fact it turns out SBF was the second-biggest donor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind only George Soros .\nIt is interesting to note that the biggest funders to the ruling party in the USA are now both billionaire scam artists .\nSoros being famous for his attempt to collapse the British Pound in 1992.13 FTX collapsed in a similar way to Celsius , where the price of crypto currencies dipped ; they were unable to back up their risky and highly-collaterised investment debts .\nThe company has folded and wiped out a huge amount of American cryptocurrency user \u2019 s stacks .\nFTX had risen at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traction , it was being looked at by big institutions and many people who had initially been sceptical and had begun to get on board .\nThey famously sponsored a sports stadium , the \u2018 FTX arena \u2019 and paid for a half-time show at the superbowl .\nI highlighted the close ties between FTX , SBF and the Democrat party as one of the reasons why such an obviously high-risk company was allowed to operate and expand without being stopped .\nI am of the opinion that it was a racket between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy money to sluice into the party .\nNow FTX is going through liquidation and bankruptcy but we know for sure that the Democrat party is not giving that money back .\nThus , we have the crypto winter .\nCrypto currencies are being battered from all sides .\nOne hand is throwing negative press , issuing derogatory statements and feeding the dearth of true understanding of crypto currency .\nThe other hand is clamping down with regulation , mandating restrictive KYC ( Know Your Customer ) legislation on exchanges , such that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documents to even buy Bitcoin .\nThe legacy institutions are pursuing a policy of death by a thousand cuts on the revolutionary crypto currency technology

of Men was a dystopian 1992 science fiction novel by P.D .\nJames set in London in the year 2021 , following the onset of a global infertility epidemic .\nThe novel was made into a film which was released in 2006 , staring British actor Clive Owen which was set in the year 2027 , where two decades of human infertility has left modern civilisation on the brink of collapse .\nNo one knew what caused the mass infertility , but it soon became evident that this biological crisis was threatening mankind with total extinction .\nAs it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can no longer be confined to the realms of science fiction .\nIf it \u2019 s true , then how do globalist elites and attendees to the World Economic Forum feel about such a development ?\nWould they welcome , or fret such an existential crisis ?\nWell , they are certainly not talking about it .\nThere is also the issue of previous reports of serious infertility and miscarriage risks posed by the unprecedented global roll-out of the experimental mRNA \u2018 vaccine \u2019 .\nThese claims were immediately attacked by armies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now self-evident that environmental toxins like microplastics , BPAs , and fatal diet and lifestyle conditions like obesity and dependence on pharmacuetical products \u2013 that pose a far greater threat to fertility and life on earth than the wildly speculative computer-modelled , theoretical spectre of climate change\u2026 Massively declining sperm counts are a global problem , according to new research that has evident implications for the survival of the natural human race .\nCurrent trends in sperm counts , if extrapolated , suggest that , as early as 2050 , the species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man will have a sperm count of zero , meaning that one half of all men will produce no sperm at all , and the other half will produce so few as to be functionally infertile .\nResearchers have further corroborated prior information gained on sperm counts in North America , Europe , and Australia , revealing the decline in sperm counts is mirrored in South and Central America , Asia , and Africa too .\nDeclining fertility and the resulting \u201c crisis of masculinity \u201d have become a political issue in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host Tucker Carlson \u2019 s documentary , The End of Men .\nThe film drew furious responses from the liberal media , who accused Carlson of \u201c ramping fears \u201d and \u201c push [ ing ] pseudoscience onto impressionable men.\n\u201d Now , Carlson \u2019 s claims look more prescient than pseudoscientific , with a team of researchers from Israel , the US , Denmark , Brazil and Spain analyzing sperm count data from 53 countries , in regions that had not previously been considered in such studies .\nWhile sperm count data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oceania had already been subjected to rigorous analysis and discussion , the same was not true for data from Latin America , Asia and Africa .\nThe researchers have been able to show , for the first time , that men in Latin America , Asia , and Africa are also suffering from exactly the same \u201c significant decline \u201d in total sperm counts ( TSC ) and sperm concentration ( SC ) as their counterparts in the West .\nWhat \u2019 s more , the researchers have also shown that the decline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ globally since 2000 .\n\u201c Overall , we \u2019 re seeing a significant worldwide decline in sperm counts of over 50 percent in the past 46 years , a decline that has accelerated in recent years , \u201d said Prof. Hagai Levine in a media release to accompany the study .\n\u201c Our findings serve as a canary in a coal mine .\nWe have a serious problem on our hands that , if not mitigated , could threaten mankind \u2019 s survival .\nWe urgently call for global action to promote healthier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and behaviors that threaten our reproductive health , \u201d Levine adds .\nProfessor Shanna Swan , one of the co-authors of the research , has made headlines in the last year with her new book Count Down , in which she predicts an imminent \u201c spermageddon \u201d scenario , wherein by 2050 , almost zer0-level sperm counts will lead to existential issues for humankind .\nThe median man could have a sperm count of zero , meaning that one half of all men will produce no sperm at all , and the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be functionally infertile .\nAlthough the study does not specifically investigate the causes of this decline in sperm counts outside the Western world , the authors are in no doubt that \u201c lifestyle choices and chemicals in the environment \u201d are playing an important role .\nThese are precisely the causes Professor Swan identifies in her new book .\nObesity and inactivity are powerfully implicated in male fertility decline , and so is exposure to so-called endocrine-disrupting chemicals , like BPA and phthalates .\nPeople around the world are getting fatter and doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human exposure to endocrine disruptors , which are often essential to industrial processes like the manufacture of plastics , is now being revealed .\nMicroplastics \u2013 tiny pieces of plastic that act as vectors for endocrine disruptors \u2013 have been found in arctic ice , circulating on wind currents , and at the bottom of the oceans , as well as in the lungs , brains and placentas of mammals , including humans .\nExposure to endocrine disruptors during gestation is a particular problem , and can adversely affect fetal development .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ how disturbances in the development of the reproductive tract during fetal development display a link to lifetime impairment of fertility and other forms of reproductive dysfunction .\nAs well as serving as a measure of reproductive fitness , sperm counts are a more general index for male health .\nLow counts are tied to lower testosterone levels and an increased risk of chronic diseases , depression , testicular cancer and reduced lifespan .\n\u201c The troubling declines in men \u2019 s sperm concentration and total sperm counts at over 1 percent each year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with adverse trends in other men \u2019 s health outcomes , such as testicular cancer , hormonal disruption , and genital birth defects , as well as declines in female reproductive health .\nThis clearly can not continue unchecked , \u201d explains Swan .\nThe Importance of The End of Men These concerning trends have been given a new political importance by the recent Tucker Carlson Original , \u201c The End of Men \u201d , which explores the decline in male fertility , as reflected in sperm counts and testosterone levels , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success of the nation .\nThe documentary features interviews with an array of experts , including Robert Kennedy Jr. , as well as features on attempts by \u201c broscientists \u201d to reclaim their masculinity through exercise , clean eating and , most memorably , \u201c testicle tanning \u201d .\nThe documentary was hit with a furious backlash from commentators on the left , who accused Tucker Carlson of exaggeration , promoting \u201c pseudoscience \u201d and flirting with \u201c fascist \u201d rhetoric and imagery , by glorifying healthy , fit bodies or \u201c hyper-militant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence of \u201c persons of color \u201d from the documentary , while others were content simply to point their fingers and laugh .\n\u201c Tucker Carlson \u2019 s documentary is a bizarre , homoerotic fever dream \u201d , ran a headline from pedophile publisher Pink News .\nIt \u2019 s hard not to suspect that Tucker \u2019 s predominant focus on young white men , a demographic liberal commentators could hardly be accused of taking a positive interest in , let alone caring for , is one of the major reasons for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a serious spanner in the works for those who want to claim Tucker is simply playing on fears about a lost American past where men were men .\nThe truth is , the masculinity

turns out , their sordid operation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bruce Golding from the New York Post report\u2026 The second installment of Elon Musk \u2019 s \u201c Twitter Files \u201d dropped Thursday night and reveals how the social media giant was secretly \u201c blacklisting \u201d conservative tweets and users .\nIndependent journalist Bari Weiss detailed in a series of posts how Twitter used so-called \u201c shadow banning \u201d to limit the visibility of tweets coming from far-right users .\nConservative talk show host Dan Bongino , Stanford University \u2019 s anti-COVID lockdown advocate Dr. Jay Bhattacharya and right-wing activist Charlie Kirk were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twitter , according to Weiss .\nThe former New York Times and Wall Street Journal writer said the blacklists were built \u201c in secret \u201d and \u201c without informing users.\n\u201d \u201c A new [ Twitter Files ] investigation reveals that teams of Twitter employees build blacklists , prevent disfavored tweets from trending , and actively limit the visibility of entire accounts or even trending topics \u2014 all in secret , without informing users , \u201d Weiss wrote in a tweet Thursday .\nShe notes that the company strayed from its original mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create and share ideas and information instantly , without barriers \u201d by developing the methods to suppress specific individuals .\nBhattacharya \u2019 s account , for example , was flagged as being on a \u201c trends blacklist , \u201d according to Weiss , who shared an image of his account from Twitter \u2019 s point of view with the yellow tag indicating the restriction .\n\u201c Take , for example , Stanford \u2019 s Dr. Jay Bhattacharya who argued that Covid lockdowns would harm children .\nTwitter secretly placed him

company \u201c shadow bans \u201d users .\n\u201c We do not shadow ban , \u201d Gadde and Beykpour said in 2018 , per Weiss .\n\u201c And we certainly don \u2019 t shadow ban based on political

is known internally as \u201c Visibility Filtering \u201d or \u201c VF.\n\u201d \u201c Think about visibility filtering as being a way for us to suppress what people see to different levels .\nIt \u2019 s a very powerful tool , \u201d a senior Twitter employee told Weiss .\n\u201c Visibility Filtering \u201d allows the company to \u201c block searches of individual users ; to limit @ @ @ @ @ @

"Twitter Files: Internal Comms Reveal How They Banned Trump", "content": "A third series of \u201c Twitter Files , \u201d published on Friday evening , offered an insight into the platform \u2019 s decision to remove the personal account of Donald Trump while he was still US president , with more revelations promised for the weekend .\nJournalist Matt Taibbi , who authored the first expose last week , began sharing the saga of Trump \u2019 s ban covering the period between October 2020 and January 6 , 2021 .\n\u201c We \u2019 ll show you what hasn \u2019 t been revealed : the erosion of standards within the company in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executives to violate their own policies , and more , against the backdrop of ongoing , documented interaction with federal agencies , \u201d Taibbi wrote .\nThe drop includes Twitter \u2019 s internal communications of clear historical importance , as the company employees recognized this was a \u201c landmark moment in the annals of speech , \u201d the first time they had suspended a sitting head of state \u2019 s account .\nTrump was banned on January 8 , after a \u201c close review \u201d of how his tweets were \u201c being received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d the company said at the time .\nHis last tweets had included a video message urging his supporters not to break the law and to peacefully depart from the US Capitol , but also his claim that the 2020 election had not been legitimate , which Twitter had declared unacceptable .\nHowever , the \u201c intellectual framework \u201d for the ban was already set up in the months before the January 6 riot at the Capitol .\nOne internal message shows a Twitter executive saying that they need to look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the election and frankly last 4+ years.\n\u201d Trump \u2019 s tweets criticizing mass voting by mail \u2013 an unprecedented measure Democrats had rolled out citing the pandemic \u2013 were being \u201c visibility filtered \u201d as late as a week before the election , with Twitter executives making up rules to do so and congratulating themselves for it .\nA special channel was created on October 8 , 2020 for senior executives , including former head of Trust and Safety Yoel Roth , Trust and Policy chief Vijaya Gadde , and top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforcement .\nThis \u201c smaller , more powerful cadre \u201d acted as a \u201c high-speed Supreme Court of moderation \u201d often making decisions \u201c on the fly , \u201d while also \u201c clearly liaising with federal enforcement and intelligence agencies about moderation of election-related content.\n\u201d While Twitter was already deploying a broad arsenal of visible and invisible tools to rein in Trump \u2019 s engagement \u201c long before \u201d the Capitol riot , Taibbi noted how on December 10 some executives wanted to use a newly created deamplification tool , before its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s reach even further .\nThe moderators became so tired of censoring Trump manually that by January 6 his account was \u201c covered in bots \u201d to automate the process of slapping warning labels on his tweets .\nWhen the protest at the Capitol escalated into a riot , the moderation team initially seemed to be in \u201c panic \u201d and \u201c despair , \u201d amid \u201c frantic calls \u201d to \u201c start deploying its full arsenal of moderation tools \u201d \u2013 until Roth eventually \u201c executed the historic act \u201d of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gadde then sent a company-wide email , in a first indication that a permanent suspension was likely imminent .\nAccording to another internal message , if Trump tried to use the official POTUS or White House accounts , Twitter would \u201c take action to limit their use \u201d until they are \u201c transitioned \u201d to the new administration on January 20 , but not suspend or ban them otherwise .\n\u201c Examining the entire election enforcement Slack , we didn \u2019 t see one reference to moderation requests from the Trump campaign , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally , \u201d Taibbi noted .\nWhile they may exist , \u201c they were absent \u201d from the files provided .\nAccording to Taibbi , Saturday \u2019 s revelations will focus on \u201c the chaos inside Twitter on January 7 , \u201d while the \u201c secret internal communications from the key date of January 8 \u201d will be published on Sunday .\nTaibbi began disclosing the \u201c Twitter Files \u201d last week , with the help and endorsement of the platform \u2019 s new owner Elon Musk .\nThe second part revealed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impacted conservative accounts .\nIt was reportedly delayed by a senior lawyer at Twitter who had been \u201c vetting \u201d the drops without Musk \u2019 s knowledge or approval .\nThat turned out to be Baker , former FBI general counsel whom Musk fired on Tuesday .\nThe White House has dismissed the revelations as a \u201c distraction \u201d from the real problem with the platform , which press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre described as \u201c hate speech.\n\u201d PLEASE HELP SUPPORT OUR INDEPENDENT MEDIA PLATFORM HERE", "author": "NEWS WIRE", "url":

"title": "Putin: Russia May Adopt US-Style \u2018Preemptive Strike\u2019 Doctrine", "content": "MOSCOW ( AP ) \u2014 Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday that Moscow could adopt what he described as a U.S. concept of using preemptive military strikes , noting it has the weapons to do the job , in a blunt statement amid rising Russia-NATO tensions over Ukraine .\n\u201c We are just thinking about it .\nThey weren \u2019 t shy to openly talk about it during the past years , \u201d Putin said , referring to the U.S. policy , as he attended a summit in Kyrgyzstan of a Moscow-dominated economic alliance of ex-Soviet nations .\nFor years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. efforts to develop the so-called Conventional Prompt Global Strike capability that envisions hitting an adversary \u2019 s strategic targets with precision-guided conventional weapons anywhere in the world within one hour .\n\u201c Speaking about a disarming strike , maybe it \u2019 s worth thinking about adopting the ideas developed by our U.S. counterparts , their ideas of ensuring their security , \u201d Putin said with a thin smile , noting that such a preemptive strike was intended to knock out command facilities .\nHe claimed that Russia already has commissioned hypersonic weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the U.S. hasn \u2019 t yet deployed them .\nHe also claimed that Russia now has cruise missiles that surpass their U.S. equivalents .\nWhile Putin appeared to refer to conventional precision-guided weapons when he talked about possibly mimicking the U.S. strategy , he specifically noted that the U.S. hasn \u2019 t ruled out the first use of nuclear weapons .\n\u201c If the potential adversary believes that it can use the theory of a preemptive strike and we don \u2019 t , it makes us think about the threats posed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defensive posture , \u201d he said .\n\u201c If the potential adversary believes that it can use the theory of a preemptive strike and we don \u2019 t , it makes us think about the threats posed by such ideas in other countries \u2019 defensive posture , \u201d he said .\nIn Washington , advisers to President Joe Biden viewed Putin \u2019 s comments as \u201c saber-rattling \u201d and another veiled warning that he could deploy a tactical nuclear weapon , according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to comment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe official noted that Russian military doctrine has long stated that Moscow reserves the right to first use of a nuclear weapon in response to large scale military aggression .\nJohn Erath , senior policy director for the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation , also viewed Putin \u2019 s statement as yet another attempt to raise the nuclear threat .\nHe elaborated on that answer Friday , saying Russia \u2019 s nuclear doctrine is based on the \u201c launch on warning \u201d concept , which envisions nuclear weapons \u2019 use in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spotted by its early warning systems .\n\u201c When the early warning system receives a signal about a missile attack , we launch hundreds of missiles that are impossible to stop , \u201d he said , smiling .\n\u201c Enemy missile warheads would inevitably reach the territory of the Russian Federation .\nBut nothing would be left of the enemy too , because it \u2019 s impossible to intercept hundreds of missiles .\nAnd this , of course , is a factor of deterrence.\n\u201d Russia \u2019 s nuclear doctrine states the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under a nuclear strike or if it faces an attack with conventional weapons that threatens \u201c the very existence \u201d of the Russian state .\nSince sending Russian troops into Ukraine in February , Putin has repeatedly said that Moscow was ready to use \u201c all available means \u201d to protect its territory and has rejected Western criticism of nuclear saber-rattling .\n\u201c I understand that ever since nuclear weapons , the weapons of mass destruction have appeared , all people \u2014 the entirety of humankind \u2014 have been worried what will happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d he said .\nSpeaking Friday at U.S. Strategic Command , which has responsibility

Parliamentarians Demand an Extra Budget to Heat the Parliament, Whilst the Rest of France is Freezing", "content": "When will Macron finally sober up on the country \u2019 s energy crisis ?\nThe French National Assembly has provided 2.3 million Euros in additional money for 2022 in order to deal in particular with the \u201c effects of inflation \u201d on the energy expenditure of their institution , along with automatic increases in the remuneration for civil servants , reported the French press this week .\nYes , you heard that right : French parliamentarians are cold , and had to get a budget \u2019 s extension to warm their seats \u2013 whilst the rest of France is freezing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is well\u2026 The Assembly \u2019 s draft budget amounted to \u20ac608.7 million , but bureaucrats had to act to secure an extension of \u20ac2.3 million \u201c in order to take into account the index revaluation measures , the uncertainties linked to the rate of progress of several real estate investments and the effects of inflation on the energy expenditure , \u201d according to the minutes meeting \u2019 s report .\nIn other words , they say the need more cash to pay the utility bills .\nLong exchanges took place , as ministers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices and on the premises of the French Assembly , in principle OK at 19\u00b0C , but sometimes less in the event of defective heating ( the radiators are old , you see ) , reported one government source .\nWe \u2019 re told that some deputies have also been happy to wear the scarf in the hemicycle for a few days ( not the entire winter of course ) .\nIronically , President Ya\u00ebl Braun-Pivet had just launched a working group on \u201c sustainable development \u201d within the institution in early August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s bold new \u201c energy sobriety measures \u201d , and for a few months on a new \u201c ecological transition plan \u201c .\nAristocratic France will of course see that its elite public servants are warm this winter , but what about the deplorables ?\nAs low as 10\u00b0C in the classrooms \u201d France is now faced with soaring energy prices , and municipalities are really struggling to heat schools ( see article ) .\nFor several weeks , many teachers and parents of students have been complaining about the temperatures in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing an explosion of energy prices for town halls and other public facilities .\nThat means massive shutdowns are coming soon .\nA few days ago , scarves and gloves were essential for students at the Bois Bohy Elementary School in Evreux ( Eure ) .\nNot just on the playground \u2013 but even in the classrooms .\n\u201c When I arrived with my daughter one morning this week , the teacher warned me that it was 12\u00b0C , \u201d said Marie , a mother of a CE2 pupil .\n\u201c Parents took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top , \u201d assured Audrey Gouff\u00e9 , vice-president of the local association of parents GIPE .\nA shocking state of affairs , especially for parents already reeling from all the lost education days due to Covid school shut down during 2021-2022 .\nThanks to a viral media report by France Info , public pressure resulted in the temperature in the classrooms being eventually adjusted .\nBohy Elementary School is not the only one , as across France many schools have faced the same situation .\nIn Limeil-Br\u00e9vannes ( Val-de-Marne ) , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were decently heated , and only after several weeks of repeated complaints from parents .\n\u201c Children can not learn in such conditions \u201d , denounced Eric Labastie , president of the FCPE , a parent-teacher association in France .\nIf the problem of heating arises every year in many dilapidated establishments , the energy crisis really complicates the deal .\nSeveral town halls interviewed by France Info are now claiming to have to save to keep to their budget and somehow cope with the explosion of bills .\nIt is now transparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d rules have already had their effect on populations across the country , as solutions are not always available \u2013 contrary to those lucky enough to work in the Parliament .\nLowly town halls do not have access to extravagant extra budgets and for French mayors every penny counts .\nElite politicians are expecting the provincial officials and other public employees to \u2018 tough it out \u2019 for the remainder of the winter .\nIt gets worse : at Vire Hospital in Normandy , the management refuses to turn on the heating .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ manage just 15 degrees in a room \u2013 with the heating largely cut off \u2018 for the sake of economy \u2019 in this Norman hospital .\nThe director of the nursing homes questioned by the local daily paper , confirmed that he indeed had \u201c never given his agreement to turn on the heating.\n\u201d \u201c We have received recommendations for energy sobriety from the public services .\nThese are national guidelines , \u201d he added .\nAn unimaginable 13\u00b0C was recorded inside a hospital of Meaux in France , where patients and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technical failures and dilapidated buildings , to the point where one patient \u2019 s family had to file a lawsuit against the facility for child abuse .\nMeanwhile , the Sud Sant\u00e9 Sociaux union of the hospital group in Le Havre , reported 13\u00b0C in a hospital in Le Havre in November , as the union denounced the fact that such low temperatures pose a grave risk to patients and \u201c did not make it possible to offer decent hospitalisation and working conditions , \u201d reported the union to BFM Normandie .\nWe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same challenges faced by schools , hospitals and town halls across the country , and its origin is easily identifiable , that is the raft of \u201c energy sobriety \u201d policies enacted by the Macron government which have triggered the current crisis .\nIs the European electricity market at the origin of this chaos ?\nDuring the presidential campaign , a very complex subject entered the public debate : the functioning of the European electricity market .\nAlmost all the candidates criticised the price-setting mechanisms of this market , holding it responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns out that this \u2018 middle man \u2019 market was born of the 1996 by European directive , which put an end to the regulated tariffs set by the public authorities and introduced the principle of \u2018 competition \u2019 in the wholesale power and energy supply markets .\nIn France , where the organization of the electricity system , led by EDF at the time , seemed to be very satisfactory , the new directive was not implemented until four years later .\nToday , this market mechanism contributes to a truly confusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainly from decarbonized sources ( nuclear , hydro , wind and solar ) , the price of electricity is still influenced by gas prices \u2013 which skyrocketed this winter \u2013 something Macron \u2019 s government has blamed on the Russian invasion of Ukraine .\nIn reality , those prices were already surging in 2021 \u2013 long before Putin \u2019 s foray in Ukraine in late February 2022 .\nThe surge in electricity prices is directly related to the functioning of this absurd European market of electricity .\nUK consumers are aloes getting ripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that same time around 2000 as it was in France .\nIndeed , without the newly created speculators \u2019 markets , electricity prices would have followed the normal predictable costs of the electricity system , which have only increased by 4 % in 2021 , compared to 2020 , and less than 5 % compared to 2019 , before the health crisis ( see Anne Debregeas , research engineer in electrical system \u2019 s economics at EDF and spokesperson for SUD-Energie calculations here ) .\nThis increase is mainly due to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onlyof the costs of the electricity system .\nOne could draw the conclusion then , that without the European \u2018 middle man \u2019 markets , there may not have been a crisis regarding the country \u2019 s electricity bills .\nInterestingly , the mainstream press are not talking much about the financiers \u2019 energy trading markets .\nThey \u2019 re just doing the same as the President , blaming \u2018 Putin \u2019 s war \u2019 in Ukraine .\nThere are some solutions available .\nSpain and Portugal have obtained an exceptional exemption from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nTo leave the European electricity market and put an end to the dogma of \u2018 free competition \u2019 , the demands will also need to be drawn up by the representative bodies of EDF employees , who have launched the National Energy Council as a sign of resistance .\nSuch moves could be promising , at least in offering some short term relief to a near impossible situation .\nThe government in a desperate attempt to anticipates all possible scenarios \u201d in case of shortage of electricity in France , published a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prefects across the country to help them prepare their regions to \u201c targeted and programmed cuts of electricity \u201d .\n.\nWelcome to European States of America The \u201c European States of America \u201d aka the EU , with their German allies , seem to have been occupied for a very long time , carefully orchestrating the deindustrialisation of Europe , and it is extremely disappointing , to say the least , to bear witness of our country being abandoned by its leadership , in favor of a globalist ideal , conceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show any benefits to the citizen of France .\nWords of incomprehension are certainly getting traction in the hexagons , and the trust in our institution is once more being eroded .\nIn France , the last major power cuts were in the last century , and electricity was not as important as it is today for all information and communications networks which power a 21st century civilisation .\nFrom now on , with our backs to the wall ( thanks to Macron and his unelected globalist cohort ) we must take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controllable power plants , i.e .\nnuclear power plants , as well as hydroelectricity \u2013 as a priority to secure the reindustrialisation of the country \u2013 powered by an abundant supply of cheap , reliable sovereign energy .\nAstonishingly , we recently heard Macron calling for \u2018 unity and sobriety \u2019 , and for the people of France to rally behind him , whilst still pointing the finger of contempt at those who are spreading fear about the forecasted load shedding and power cuts .\nThe level of dystopia in our executive branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does Macron has the audacity in the below interview to condemn those who are \u2018 spreading fear \u2019 in France , but he also added \u201c we are going to hold firm despite the war \u201c , implying that we are all at war , and that the Russia-Ukraine conflict is the only reason behind the energy crisis in France .\nNothing could be further from the truth .\nInsulting his peoples \u2019 intelligence seems to have become his favorite pass time , and it is rather disconcerting the speed with which Macron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself has been the chief fearmongerer \u2013 for two long years constantly announcing France was \u2018 at war \u2019 with the alleged COVID-19 pandemic , and he had no issue pushing unjustifiable liberticide corona measures , and mandating the deadly shots , whilst insulting millions of unvaccinated French citizens .\nIt \u2019 s safe to says that the mental health of this man is questionable .\nEnergy crisis : \u201c The scenarios of fear ?\nNot for me , \u201d says Emmanuel Macron ( Source : BFMTV Twitter ) : The common thread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pandemic \u201d and this energy crisis , is the way in which fear has once more been injected into the population to satisfy a globalist agenda that is taking a serious toll on the citizenry .\nI am doubtful that people in France will take much more of this lunacy .\nWell , the good news is our Parliamentarians won \u2019 t freeze to death this winter , and will be able to comfortably reflect ( between a croissant and a warm coffee ) on the fate of the deplorables , the elderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the patients in our hospitals .\nFinally , the United States and France also announced the formation of \u2018 Joint Task Force \u2019 between the United States and the European Union , allegedly to deal with trade disputes around clean energy issues emerging from Biden \u2019 s disastrous Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 ( IRA ) .\nFunny how EU is worried about potential new trade barriers on European electric vehicle producers \u2013 when the people are freezing right across the continent .\nWe should be grateful that our elites are fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything is warm and shinny under the sun , especially in our Parliament .\nThis won \u2019 t fly for much longer .\nMacron \u2019 s destitution is looming\u2026 PLEASE HELP

violence in the Al-Aqsa Mosque , \u201d it read in Arabic .\n\u201c We will hold you accountable.\n\u201d Ramlawi , then 19 , was among hundreds of people who civil rights attorneys estimate got the text last year , at the height of one of the most turbulent recent periods in the Holy Land .\nMany , including Ramlawi , say they only lived or worked in the neighborhood , and had nothing to do with the unrest .\nWhat he didn \u2019 t know was that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bet , was using mass surveillance technology mobilized for coronavirus contact tracing , against Israeli residents and citizens for purposes entirely unrelated to COVID-19 .\nIn the pandemic \u2019 s bewildering early days , millions worldwide believed government officials who said they needed confidential data for new tech tools that could help stop coronavirus \u2019 spread .\nIn return , governments got a firehose of individuals \u2019 private health details , photographs that captured their facial measurements and their home addresses Now , from Beijing to Jerusalem to Hyderabad , India , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has found that authorities used these technologies and data to halt travel for activists and ordinary people , harass marginalized communities and link people \u2019 s health information to other surveillance and law enforcement tools .\nIn some cases , data was shared with spy agencies .\nThe issue has taken on fresh urgency almost three years into the pandemic as China \u2019 s ultra-strict zero-COVID policies recently ignited the sharpest public rebuke of the country \u2019 s authoritarian leadership since the pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989 .\nFor more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pored over thousands of documents to trace how technologies marketed to \u201c flatten the curve \u201d were put to other uses .\nJust as the balance between privacy and national security shifted after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks , COVID-19 has given officials justification to embed tracking tools in society that have lasted long after lockdowns .\n\u201c Any intervention that increases state power to monitor individuals has a long tail and is a ratcheting system , \u201d said John Scott-Railton , a senior researcher at the Toronto-based internet watchdog Citizen Lab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very unlikely it will ever go away.\n\u201d In China , the last major country in the world to enforce strict COVID-19 lockdowns , citizens have been required to install cell-phone apps to move about freely in most cities .\nDrawing from telecommunications data and PCR test results , the apps produce individual QR codes that change from green to yellow or red , depending on a person \u2019 s health status .\nThe apps and lockdowns are part of China \u2019 s sweeping pandemic prevention policies that have pushed the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment fire in Urumqi last month left at least 10 dead , many blamed zero-tolerance COVID policies .\nThat sparked demonstrations in major cities nationwide , the largest display of defiance in decades , after which the government announced it would only check health codes in \u201c special places , \u201d such as schools , hospitals and nursing homes .\nLast week , the government went further , saying it would shut down a national-level health code to ease travel between provinces .\nBut cities and provinces have their own codes , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week , restaurants , offices , hotels and gyms were still requiring local codes for entry .\nOver the past few years , Chinese citizens have needed a green code to board domestic flights or trains , and in some cities even to enter the supermarket or to get on a bus .\nIf they were found to have been in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19 , or if the government imposed a local quarantine , the code would turn red , and they were stuck at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health codes have been used to stifle dissent .\n__ This story , supported by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting , is part of an ongoing Associated Press series , \u201c Tracked , \u201d that investigates the power and consequences of decisions driven by algorithms on people \u2019 s everyday lives .\n__ In early September , former wealth manager Yang Jiahao bought a train ticket to Beijing , where he planned to lodge various complaints with the central government .\nThe night before , a woman he described as a handler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually hired by state security as part of \u201c stability maintenance \u201d operations and can require people to meet or travel when authorities worry they could cause trouble .\nYang had a meal with the handler , and the next morning Guangzhou health authorities reported a COVID-19 case less than a kilometer from where they dined , he said .\nBased on city regulations , Yang \u2019 s code should have turned yellow , requiring him to take a few COVID tests to show he was negative .\nInstead , the app turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he didn \u2019 t have COVID .\nYang was ordered to quarantine and a paper seal was placed on his door .\n\u201c They can do whatever they want , \u201d he said .\nFrom Beijing to Jerusalem to Hyderabad , India , The Associated Press has found that authorities used COVID-19 technologies and data to halt travel for activists and ordinary people , and link people \u2019 s health information to other surveillance and law enforcement tools .\n( AP Video ) An officer at the Huangcun station of the Guangzhou police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s case , saying he required proof that the caller was from AP .\nGuangzhou \u2019 s Public Security Bureau and the city \u2019 s Center for Disease Control and Prevention did not respond to faxed requests for comment .\nIn another show of how the apps can control lives , in June , a group of bank customers were effectively corralled by the health codes when they tried going to Henan \u2019 s provincial capital in Zhengzhou to protest being unable to access their online bank accounts .\nA notice said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upgrade .\nBut the customers soon found out the real reason : a police investigation into stockholders in the parent bank had rendered 40 billion yuan in funds inaccessible , according to local media reports .\nFrustrated after months of complaints , a group of customers decided to hold a protest in Zhengzhou at the provincial banking commission .\nCustomer Xu Zhihao uploaded his itinerary to get the Henan province health code after he tested negative for COVID-19 in his coastal city of Tianjin , just south of Beijing .\nAs he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was asked to scan his QR code at the station , and immediately it turned red .\nThe train station employee called security and took him to a police booth .\nXu said police took him to the basement to quarantine .\nThree other people joined him , and all four realized that they had come to get their money back .\n\u201c They had set the net in place , waiting for us , \u201d Xu said .\nFrom a group chat , Xu and others learned that many protesters had met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rail train station , at the airport and even on the highway .\nA government inquiry later found that red codes were given to 1,317 people , many of whom had planned to protest .\nChina \u2019 s National Health Commission , which has led the COVID response , did not reply to a fax requesting comment .\nThe Henan provincial government did not respond either .\nEven after China ends lockdowns , some dissidents and human rights activists predict the local-level health codes will stay on as a technological means of social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t share data , but in the past few years , that has changed .\nSome provincial governments have created local apps that can link health , location and even credit information , which leaves open the possibility for these apps or the national databases they draw from to be used to monitor people in the future , according to an AP review of procurement documents , research and interviews .\nXu and Yang , for instance , were both stopped in their tracks by local health codes .\nIn February , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upgrade their local health code so they could search PCR test results for anyone in China , in real time , according to procurement documents provided exclusively by ChinaFile , a digital magazine published by the Asia Society .\nA company whose parent is government-owned won the non-competitive bid to connect that app to a national database of PCR data run by the State Council , China \u2019 s Cabinet , fulfilling a national directive , the documents show .\nThe same company , Beijing Beiming Digital Technology , also claims on its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 pandemic apps .\n\u201c It \u2019 s the governance model , the philosophy behind it is to strengthen social control through technology .\nIt \u2019 s strengthened by the health app , and it \u2019 s definitely going to stay after COVID is over , \u201d said Yaqiu Wang , a senior researcher with Human Rights Watch .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s very , very powerful.\n\u201d \u201c THERE ARE TWO SETS OF LAWS \u201d In Jerusalem \u2019 s Old City , tourists sipping fresh pomegranate juice , worshippers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitored by Israeli security forces holding automatic weapons .\nThe labyrinth of cavernous pathways is also lined with CCTV cameras and what authorities have described as \u201c advanced technologies.\n\u201d After clashes in May 2021 at the Al-Aqsa Mosque helped trigger an 11-day war with Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip , Israel experienced some of the worst violence in years .\nPolice lobbed stun grenades into the disputed compound known to Jews as the Temple Mount , home to Al-Aqsa , Islam \u2019 s third-holiest site , as Palestinian crowds holed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBy that time , Israelis had become accustomed to police showing up outside their homes to say they weren \u2019 t observing quarantine and knew that Israel \u2019 s Shin Bet security agency was repurposing phone surveillance technology it had previously used to monitor militants inside Palestinian territories .\nThe practice made headlines at the start of the pandemic when the Israeli government said it would be deployed for COVID-19 contact tracing .\nA year later , the Shin Bet quietly began using the same technology to send threatening messages to Israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agency suspected of participating in violent clashes with police .\nSome of the recipients , however , simply lived or worked in the area , or were mere passers-by

\u2019 s like the government is in your bag , \u201d said Ramlawi , who worries that surveillance enabled to stop COVID-19 poses a lasting menace for east Jerusalem residents .\n\u201c When you move ,

and three servicemen were killed by debris at the Engels airbase , which houses Tu-95 and Tu-160 nuclear-capable strategic bombers that have been involved in launching strikes on Ukraine in the 10-month-old war , \u201d reports the Associated Press .\nThere have been a number of attacks inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the village of Staraya Nelidovka in the Belgorod region , and the military

centres , gas pipelines and fuel depots have all suffered damage across Russia in recent months with Mr Murphy pointing to a CIA-directed campaign of covert \u201c sabotage.\n\u201d On his website , Murphy writes the \u201c campaign involves long standing sleeper cells that the allied spy service has activated to hinder Moscow \u2019 s invasion of Ukraine by waging a secret war behind Russian lines.\n\u201d While no American personnel are involved on the ground in Russia in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paramilitary officers are commanding and controlling the operations , according to two former

Center , said the two former intelligence officials .\nUsing an allied intelligence service to give the CIA an added layer of plausible deniability was an essential factor in U.S. President Joe Biden \u2019 s decision to approve the strikes , according to a former U.S. special operations official .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ has long been involved in precisely these kinds of sabotage operations .\nPrior to the establishment of the national security state and the CIA , the agency \u2019 s predecessor , the Office of Strategic Services ( OSS ) , produced a sabotage manual in 1944 .\n\u201c Sabotage varies from highly technical coup de main acts that require detailed planning and the use of specially trained operatives , to innumerable simple acts which the ordinary individual citizen-saboteur can perform , \u201d states the manual in its introduction .\nSince that time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn \u201c At the Abyss : An Insider \u2019 s History of the Cold War , \u201d Thomas C. Reed , a former U.S. Air Force secretary who was serving in the National Security Council at the time , writes the CIA , under its notorious boss , William Casey , was responsible for a natural gas pipeline explosion that crippled the flagging Soviet economy in 1982 .\n\u201c In order to disrupt the Soviet gas supply , its hard currency earnings from the West , and the internal Russian economy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pumps , turbines , and valves was programmed to go haywire , after a decent interval , to reset pump speeds and valve settings to produce pressures far beyond those acceptable to pipeline joints and welds , \u201d Reed writes .\nThe National Security Archive has a large number of documents detailing CIA sabotage operations .\nFrom the introduction : The covert operations of the Central Intelligence Agency are one element of the forward edge of power in U.S. foreign policy .\nBut the CIA is not a lone ranger , shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A senior interagency group within the United States government acts as the high command of the secret war .\nAs Murphy notes , any \u201c covert action undertaken by U.S. agencies must be authorized by a presidential finding , \u201d thus we can accurately assume President Biden signed off on sabotage operations inside Russia .\nMoreover , President Obama , well before Russia \u2019 s SMO , signed \u201c a finding for covert action against Russia before he left office , \u201d and the finding \u201c included language about sabotage operations , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other words , the USG had planned subversion operations inside Russia well before the SMO , basically a continuation of decades of sabotage and covert operations targeting the Soviet Union and , after its fall , the Russian Federation .\nFollowing the USG-orchestrated coup in Kyiv , an \u201c allied spy service \u201d began running sleeper cells in Russia , an \u201c extensive network \u201d that included \u201c front companies that were established as platforms to support such behind-the-lines operations , \u201d many that go back at least 20 years , thus revealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by at least two decades .\nThe CIA had formed \u201c stay behind armies , \u201d ostensibly to resist an unlikely Soviet invasion of Europe , and these were involved in terrorist acts designed to frighten populations away from voting for socialist , communist , and other leftist political parties .\nThe covert branch of the CIA , the Office of Policy Coordination , under the direction of Frank Wisner , set up Europe \u2019 s stay-behind armies .\nDubbed Operation Gladio , the CIA established paramilitaries in France ( \u201c Plan Bleu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Austria , Sweden , Finland , Denmark , Norway , Germany ( led by former SS officer Hans

the neo-Nazis in Ukraine and emigre groups .\nProject AERODYNAMIC ( formerly CARTEL , ANDROGEN , AECARTHAGE , between 1949 and 1970 ) concentrated on anti-Soviet operations , largely confined to propaganda .\nThis entailed working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one goal in mind\u2014the murder of ethnic Russians in Ukraine .\nAs early as 1949 , the CIA used Ukraine\u2014and Belarus , Poland , and the Baltics\u2014as a base of operations to undermine the Soviet Union .\nThe goal of Operation Red Sox was to provide \u201c unprecedented insight into Moscow \u2019 s designs in Eastern Europe\u2014and , if possible , to help crack apart the Soviet empire itself , \u201d according to Politico .\nIn addition , the CIA was \u201c stoking nascent nationalist movements in Ukraine \u201d and across the Balkans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recruited rightwing extremists to engage in various terrorist attacks , as revealed during the trial of Italian fascist Vincenzo Vinciguerra , a member of Ordine Nuovo ( \u201c New Order \u201d ) , a far-right cultural and extra-parliamentary political and paramilitary organization .\nIt shared a motto with the Nazi Waffen SS .\nThe Movimento Politico Ordine Nuovo staged terror attacks blamed on leftists .\nThe attacks include the 1969 bombing of the Piazza Fontana in Milan , killing 16 people , and in 1970 , the bombing of the Rome-Messina train , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terror attacks were called a \u201c strategy of tension.\n\u201d The recent CIA-NATO sabotage operation , Murphy explains , is but one of many such efforts to undermine and take down Putin and the Russian Federation .\nThe NATO ally \u2019 s campaign overseen by the CIA is only one of several covert operations efforts being undertaken by Western nations in Russia , according to two former U.S.

considers a threat to its national security .\nVladimir Putin has said on several occasions Russia will respond to existential threats with tactical nuclear weapons .\nPutin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the

mid-century.\n\u201d ( emphasis mine ) \u201c Sustainable agriculture \u201d with \u201c net zero greenhouse gas emissions \u201d is Orwellian doublespeak .\nFor an outsider to UN linguistics , the words sound too good .\nWhat in fact is being promoted is the most radical destruction of farming and agriculture globally under the name \u201c sustainable agriculture.\n\u201d Following the Bali G20 confab by only days was the United Nations \u2019 COP27 annual Green Agenda Climate Summit meeting in Egypt .\nThere , the participants from most UN countries along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other green NGOs drafted a second call .\nCOP27 launched something they revealingly call FAST\u2013 UN \u2019 s new Food and Agriculture for Sustainable Transformation ( FAST ) initiative .\nFast , as in \u201c to

climate change by $ 1.3 trillion .\nWhat \u2019 s really going on behind all these words ?\nAccording to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization speaking to Reuters during COP27 , within a year the FAO will launch a \u201c gold standard \u201d blueprint for reduction of so-called Greenhouse gases from agriculture .\nThe impulse for this war on agriculture comes not surprisingly from big money , FAIRR Initiative , a UK-based coalition of international investment managers which focuses on \u201c material ESG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production.\n\u201d Their members include the most influential players in global finance including BlackRock , JP Morgan Asset Management , Allianz AG of Germany , Swiss Re , HSBC Bank , Fidelity Investments , Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management , Credit Suisse , Rockefeller Asset Management , UBS Bank and numerous other banks and pension funds with total assets under management of $ 25 trillion .\nThey are now opening the war on agriculture much as they have on energy .\nThe UN FAO Deputy Director for Climate Change policies , Zitouni Ould-Dada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There has never been this much attention to food and agriculture anytime before .\nThis COP is definitely the one.\n\u201d The FAIRR claims , without proof , that \u201c food production accounts for around a third of global greenhouse gas emissions and is the main threat to 86 % of the world \u2019 s species at risk of extinction , while cattle ranching is responsible for three quarters of Amazon rainforest loss.\n\u201d The FAO plans to propose drastic reduction in global livestock production , especially cattle , which FAIRR claims is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the global methane emissions linked to human activity , released in the form of cattle burps , manure and the cultivation of feed crops.\n\u201d For them , the best way to stop cow burps and cow manure is to eliminate cattle .\nThe fact that the UN FAO is about to release a roadmap to drastically reduce so-called greenhouse gases from global agriculture , under the false claim of \u201c sustainable agriculture \u201d that is being driven by the world \u2019 s largest wealth managers including BlackRock , JP Morgan , AXA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true agenda .\nThese are some of the most corrupt financial institutions on the planet .\nThey never put a penny where they are not guaranteed huge profits .\nThe war on farming is their next target .\nThe term \u201c sustainable \u201d was created by David Rockefeller \u2019 s Malthusian Club of Rome .\nIn their 1974 report , Mankind at the Turning Point , The Club of Rome argued : Nations can not be interdependent without each of them giving up some of , or at least acknowledging limits to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to draw up a master plan for organic sustainable growth and world development based on global allocation of all finite resources and a new global economic system .\n( emphasis mine ) That was the early formulation of the UN Agenda 21 , Agenda2030 and the 2020 Davos Great Reset .\nIn 2015 UN member nations adopted what is called the Sustainable Development Goals or SDGs : 17 Goals to Transform our World\u200b .\nGoal 2 is \u201c End hunger , achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposals of COP27 , G20 and Davos WEF of Klaus Schwab we find what is meant by these nice sounding words .\nNow we are being inundated with claims , unverified , by numerous government and privately-funded think tank models that our agriculture systems are a major cause of , yes , global warming .\nNot only CO2 but methane and nitrogen .\nYet the entire global greenhouse gas argument that our planet is on the brink of irreversible disaster if we do not radically change our emissions by 2030 is unverifiable nonsense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these models the UN IPCC insists that if we do not stop a global temperature rise of 1.5 C above the level of 1850 , by 2050 the world will essentially end .\nThe War is Just Beginning The UN and Davos WEF teamed up in 2019 to jointly advance the SDG UN Agenda 2030 .\nOn the WEF website this is openly admitted to mean getting rid of meat protein sources , introducing promoting unproven fake meat , advocating alternative protein such as salted ants or ground crickets or worms to replace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COP27 , discussion was about \u201c diets that can remain within planetary boundaries , including lowering meat consumption , developing alternatives , and spurring the shift towards more native plants , crops and grains ( thus reducing the current reliance on wheat , maize , rice , potatoes ) .\n\u201d The WEF is promoting a shift from meat protein diets to vegan arguing it would be more \u201c sustainable \u201d .\nThey also promote lab-grown or plant-based lab meat alternatives such as the Bill Gates-funded Impossible Burgers , whose own FDA tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is produced with GMO soy and other products saturated with glyphosate .\nThe CEO of Air Protein , another fake meat company , Lisa Lyons , is a special WEF adviser .\nWEF also promotes insect protein alternatives to meat .\nNote also Al Gore is a Trustee of WEF .\nThe war on animal raising for meat is just getting deadly serious .\nThe government of the Netherlands whose Prime Minister Mark Rutte , formerly of Unilever , is a WEF Agenda Contributor , has created a special Minister for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wal .\nUsing a never-invoked and outdated EU Natura 2000 nature protection guidelines designed allegedly to \u201c protect moss and clover , \u201d and based on fraudulent test data , the Government just announced it will forcibly close 2,500 cattle farms across Holland .\nTheir goal is to force fully 30 % of cattle farms to close or face expropriation .\nIn Germany the German Meat Industry Association ( VDF ) , says that within the next four to six months Germany will face a meat shortage , and prices will skyrocket .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , \u201c In four , five , six months we will have gaps on the shelves.\n\u201d Pork is expected to experience the worst shortages .\nThe issues in meat supply are due to Berlin insisting on reducing the numbers of livestock by 50 % to reduce global warming emissions .\nIn Canada , the Trudeau government , another Davos WEF product , according to the Financial Post of July 27 , plans to cut emissions from fertilizer 30 per cent by 2030 as part of a plan to get to net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But growers are saying that to achieve that , they may have to shrink grain output significantly .\nWhen the autocratic President of Sri Lanka banned all import of nitrogen fertilizers in April 2021 in a brutal effort to return to a past of \u201c sustainable \u201d agriculture , harvests collapsed in seven months and famine and farmer ruin and mass protests forced him to flee the country .\nHe ordered that the entire country would immediately switch to organic farming but provided farmers with no such training .\nCombine all this with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian natural gas used to make nitrogen-based fertilizers , forcing shutdowns of fertilizer plants across the EU , that will cause a global reduction in crop yields , and as well the fake Bird Flu wave that is falsely ordering farmers across North America and the EU to kill off tens of millions of chickens and turkeys to cite just a few more cases , and it becomes clear that our world faces a food crisis that is unprecedented .\nAll for climate change ?\n*** F.

and conspiratorial events of the past year .\nIt goes without saying that 2022 has been a long-running nightmare for many , but also a reoccurring revelation .\nStill , some people are glad to see the back of it , while rightly cautiously optimistic that next year \u2018 couldn \u2019 t get any worse.\n\u2019 That remains to be seen , and more insights on that front are available in our other annual opus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another truism : the tin foil hat conspiracy theorists continue to be vindicated as significant events unfold .\nSo much so , that we can now lay that common trope \u2013 \u201c Oh , it \u2019 s just a coincidence \u201d \u2013 safely to rest .\nHenceforth , those who still insist on continuing to refer to bona fide conspiracies as mere coincidences , should be referred to as coincidence theorists .\nBefore we get to the top ten list , here are some of the honorable mentions from this past year\u2026 These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s standout stories which didn \u2019 t make the top tier .\nEvents of note include the incredible Canadian Truckers Protest against the Trudeau regime \u2019 s draconian attack on Canadian citizens demanding a restoration of their basic human rights .\nWe also saw the mysterious demolition of the infamous Georgia Guide Stones monument to Malthusian eugenics , the precarious trial of Jeffrey Epstein \u2019 s partner in crime Ghislane Maxwell which somehow netted no VIP client names ( and amazingly , she \u2019 s still alive in one piece ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pelosi \u2019 s husband Pauli P. supposedly getting mauled with a hammer by a known local personality in their San Francisco mansion \u2013 a story promptly buried my the MSM right before the election .\nOn the tech front , we should point to the ominous unleashing by Google \u2019 s OpenAI of their new ChatGPT artificial intelligence bot .\nIt was a moderate year for false flags and mass shootings , with a few heavily politicized high-profile anomalous events like the Uvalde School Shooting in Texas and the Club Q Shooting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dutch Farmers Revolt exposing a pernicious anti-farming and GMO food agenda by the World Economic Forum and Bill Gates networks , along with meat shortages and continued supply chain disruptions \u2013 all converging to form the perfect financial storm which now threatens to ravage an already weak and unstable global economy .\nLater in the year came a real blast from the past , reports of an imminent document release which contains some evidence of the CIA \u2019 s role in the JFK Assassination .\nGranted , these are just a few in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ didn \u2019 t make our final cut .\nSo without further ado , here are the top ten conspiracies of 2022\u2026 10 .\nUS Midterm Election Fraud \u2013 Considering all that is going on in the US and internationally at this time , most Americans would agree that the 2022 Midterm Election was one of the most important and consequential elections of their lifetime .\nBoth the House of Representatives and US Senate were up for grabs , and there was a real opportunity to correct a serious imbalance of power in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a real air of trepidation , as the shadow of the controversial 2020 Election still loomed large , with accusations of widespread and systemic election fraud still unresolved .\nThe sum of all fears became real again in the key swing state of Arizona : on election morning most of the voting machines in the state \u2019 s largest population center , Maricopa County , just happened to malfunction .\nOfficials claimed it was just an unfortunate coincidence .\nThat was only the beginning , as boxes with thousands of ballots continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn short , the Arizona election became a national and international embarrassment .\nAs it goes , the state \u2019 s election and processes were being controlled by Democratic Party operatives \u2013 who then slow-walked the vote counting for two weeks after the election was meant to be over .\nNot surprisingly , the favorite in the governor \u2019 s race , Republican , Kari Lake ( image , above ) barely lost to an unremarkable Democrat candidate Katie Hobbs ( if you believe the final contested result ) , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in charge of the state \u2019 s election debacle\u2026 was Katie Hobbs , who happened to also be serving as Arizona \u2019 s Secretary of State .\nKari Lake sued the state to demand a recount and a run-off , but political and media pressure on the courts prompted the judge to dismiss her challenge \u2013 despite having truckloads of evidence proving foul play .\nLake has appealed the decision .\nWhat \u2019 s important is that this time the world saw what happened , and the state and Democratic Party machine was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans who still hold well-founded suspicions about the infamous 2020 Election which managed to install the corrupt , deep state candidate Joe Biden into power .\nSimilar anomalies were observed in 2022 \u2013 in states like Nevada and Pennsylvania .\nIn the end , the Republicans still managed to flip the House of Representatives by a slim margin , while losing the US Senate by an even slimmer margin .\nIn a country where half the population still do not trust the democratic process , civility and stability are now teetering on borrowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Covid gravy train began to break down , the globalists \u2019 Government-Media-Pharma Complex grew desperate for a new \u2018 pandemic \u2019 to maintain the structures of control and human surveillance which they erected during the contrived Covid-19 \u2018 state of emergency \u2019 .\nEnter a relatively unknown and exotically-titled alleged pathogen , Monkeypox .\nAttempts were made to portray this mythical epidemic as some sort of universal threat , and when that failed , the Establishment then pivoted to try and promote it as a new \u201c gay disease \u201d in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reproduce the perennial ( and highly questionable ) HIV crisis .\nIn the end , their fear campaign never really took off , but not before a brand-new vaccine was created to \u201c protect the public from another potentially deadly epidemic.\n\u201d And after all that failed , efforts were then made to harvest Monkeypox some political capital from it , before sacrificing it at the altar of political correctness , as social justice clerics demanded the mythical virus be rebranded due to fears that Monkeypox was somehow racist\u2026 ?\nBut how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite sure what they meant .\nOh well .\nIntroducing \u201c MPOX \u201d .\nRinse , and repeat .\nWelcome to the world of Modern Virology ( aka Big Pharma \u2019 s main meal ticket ) .\nMeanwhile , we \u2019 re all waiting with bated breath for Bill Gates \u2019 self-confessed \u201c next pandemic.\n\u201d 8 .\nChina Lockdown Redux \u2013 Just when the Chinese were beginning to get a taste of freedom again , the Central Party decide to fire-up the pandemic control grid again .\nIn February 2022 , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the city of Shanghai .\nCentral Party claimed that the alleged \u2018 outbreak \u2019 was caused by the Omicron variant .\nThe state then proceeded to decree a new \u201c Zero Covid \u201d policy , before locking-down more cities , and dragging the country back into the authoritarian hell of February 2020 .\nAs it turned out , the real reason this new \u2018 Covid wave \u2019 materialized was because of nondiagnostic PCR testing \u2018 case \u2019 data generated through more meaningless mass COVID-19 testing .\nFinally , after 8 months of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , and China \u2019 s already fragile economy was destabilizing .\nThe state \u2019 s overzealousness then triggered mass protests against Orwellian government restrictions , with millions of Chinese taking to the streets across the country to demand their basic freedom .\nThis prompted Central Party to quickly abandon its failing social control program , and not surprisingly their economy began to rebound as people and business got back to work .\nRather interestingly , the US government seemed unhappy that China was taking its foot off the authoritarian pedal , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against China by slapping a new mandatory Covid test travel restriction on any Chinese travelers arriving in the USA .\nIt really seems that as the world \u2019 s most populous nation , without China \u2019 s total compliance the globalists \u2019 New Normal agenda will quickly fall apart .\nThis incident should tell us all we need to know about the so-called \u2018 global pandemic.\n\u2019 7 .\nThe Trans Agenda \u2013 On March 17 , 2022 , Lia Thomas ( formerly named William Thomas ) , 22 , became the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s top college sports title \u2013 following a cringe worthy victory in the women \u2019 s 500 yard freestyle .\nLet us explain : because Thomas believes he is now a woman , some institutions like the NCAA \u2013 who have come under political pressure from the radical leftist wing of the political machine \u2013 now feel obligated to allow a biological male like Thomas to compete against physically inferior biological females ( aka real women ) .\nThe victory was short-lived though , as the woke bombast of the Thomas debacle quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about so-called \u201c trans women \u201d in sports \u2013 triggering a massive backlash against this extreme ideological invasion of womens \u2019 competitive sports .\nNot long after , international sporting organizations ruled that biological male athletes like Thomas can no longer compete in top races .\nFINA , the world swimming \u2019 s governing body , also announced plans to create a new \u201c open \u201d category of competition to include \u201c transgender women \u201d ( aka men who believe they are female ) .\nNow that the debate has been blown wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people gradually return to their senses on the issue .\nBut do not expect radical leftists to surrender just yet , as the culture wars will continue to rage on .\n6 .\nFTX and SBF Ponzi Scheme \u2013 Like the S & L scandal of the 1980 \u2019 s , and the Eron and Bernie Madoff financial scams \u2013 this latest iteration of the classic Ponzi Scheme managed to destabilize markets and rob countless investors of their life savings .\nSam Bankman-Fried ( SBF ) , a 30-year-old crypto celebrity icon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were two separate companies : a hedge fund called Alameda Research and FTX cryptocurrency exchange , before going the whole hog by hyping his own fiat crypto token and then used it as collateral to create hundreds of millions of loans for himself , before robbing his depositors to embezzle and gamble away untold fortunes on the markets .\nAnd that \u2019 s just the beginning .\nIt turns out that SBF was the number two political donor to the Democratic Party , and used his laundered proceeds to bankroll a sizeable portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaigns , not to mention his mother just happening to be a chief organizer for the Democratic Party as well .\nNot surprisingly , the Biden Administration waited until after the Midterm Election to begin an investigation into the floppy haired SBF and his FTX ponzi empire .\nSBF was eventually arrested in the Bahamas and awaits federal trial in the Southern District of New York .\nThe trial is sure to be both shocking and entertaining in equal measure .\nBut the real question remains : how will this drama effect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cryptocurrency ?\nMore crucially : is the FTX takedown really a controlled demolition of crypto designed to pave the way for an oppressive Central Bank Digital Currency global \u2018 cashless \u2019 takeover ?\nWe shall see\u2026 5 .\nCBDC \u2013 2022 was the year the CBDC has made landfall , and is currently waiting in the wings of the halls of power .\nFor the last few years , elites have been gathering at globalist confabs like Bilderberg and the World Economic Forum in Davos to wax lyrical about the need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or \u2018 dirty cash \u2019 \u2013 and to make way for the central bankers \u2019 new Central Bank Digital Currencies ( CBDC ) \u2013 turning the planet into a full-blown cashless society .\nIn the US , this technocratic overhaul is being hatched under the guise of \u201c Project Hamilton \u201d as a joint effort between the Boston Federal Reserve Bank and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) to design and plan the release of a \u201c digital dollar \u201d \u2013 which will destroy the value of old dollar in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matrix .\nAs cash disappears from the economy , so does privacy .\nEssentially , CBDCs are meant to be an electronic form of fiat money in a particular country or region , but unlike Bitcoin , this digital coin is centralized and regulated by the governments and their central banks .\nWithout ever putting this matter to a public vote , elites and technocrats have simply been moving ahead to implement this authoritarian monetary system .\nWhile the mainstream media and globalist think tanks claim that the CBDC is designed to reign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crimes like money laundering , and tax avoidance ( something which elites partake in daily ) , the reality of the CBDC is something altogether different .\nThey plan to issue a programmable currency whereby the bank can control where and what you are allowed to spend your CBDC \u2019 s on .\nThey can also shut your money off .\nImagine this digital money combined with a Chinese-style social credit score .\nThis dystopian digital control grid will transform commerce and human society in ways we can possibly imagine .\nFor these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the road to digital slavery .\nThe window of opportunity to push back against this massive authoritarian assault is now closing .\n4 .\nThe Twitter Files \u2013 This is the biggest tech scandal in modern history \u2013 and it \u2019 s gone mostly unreported by 90 % of the mainstream media because of the partisan nature of its revelations .\nThe Twitter Files have provided an unprecedented look behind the dirty inner workings of the firm \u2019 s opaque censorship regime , and exposes an openly fascist merger of Silicon Valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the bloated National Security State .\nIn early December , under new management of owner and CEO Elon Musk , Twitter HQ began disseminating a massive trove of internal documents revealing the direct collusion between former CEO Jack Dorsey \u2019 s corporate regime and the US Federal Government \u2013 to censor and cancel users from the platform for speech or political views which went against globalist or government policies .\nThis included copious evidence of election interference .\nIt seems that in their desperation to conjure up proof of alleged \u201c foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other federal government officials doubled-down to try and save their sinking Russiagate narrative , and creating a monster in the process .\nNew revelations also exposed the FBI \u2019 s role in leaning on Twitter to expedite illegal censorship operations , and how so-called \u2018 public health \u2019 officials strong-armed Twitter into sanitizing all speech relating to COVID-19 and the experimental mRNA \u2018 vaccine \u2019 injections .\nThe FBI were also drawing-up shadowbanning and censorship blacklists in an attempt to cleanse the platform of effective opposition to the Biden campaign in 2020 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dorsey , the platform became an open cesspool for spooks and government operatives \u2013 many of whom appeared to be allowed to spy on users \u2019 DMs , and to dictate terms of censorship on the platform .\nWatch this space .\nThis is only the beginning .\n3 .\nSabotage of the Nordstream Pipelines \u2013 Back in late September , the world woke up to truly horrific news \u2013 both the Nordstream 1 and 2 pipelines were reported to be leaking gas into the Baltic Sea and into the atmosphere \u2013 after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sabotage .\nWhile the media played dumb , pretending not to know who carried out this attack , sane onlookers were well aware of the only entity who had the motives , means and opportunity to carry out this state-sponsored act of terror \u2013 namely the United States and its NATO partners .\nIncredibly , the entire western media quickly began blaming Russia for blowing up its most important energy infrastructure project .\nThe result of this attack was a further devastation of Europe \u2019 s energy supplies and hyperinflationary EU and UK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 not to mention the millions of cubic meters of methane which were released into the Earth \u2019 s atmosphere .\nDespite all the vacant US denials , the facts are clear as day : Joe Biden and Victoria Nuland were both on record beforehand promising they would \u201c end the Nordstream pipeline.\n\u201d Of course , this is a hugely dangerous red line which the US and its allies have crosses : by declaring a no-holds-barred geopolitical energy war , the gates are now open for further escalations \u2013 which may lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can happen .\nConsider the Anglo-American energy embargo and strong-arming of Japan which led up to the Attack on Pearl Harbor which opened the door for the US to enter WWII .\nThink of the Nordstream attack as just that , but worse \u2013 as it was also direct attack on the day-to-day energy and finances of people living in the EU and the collective West .\nIndeed , the West is playing an extremely dangerous game , which is really the Great Game 2.0 .\n2 .\nThe Energy Shock \u2013 In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 2022 as one of the most consequential years of young 21st century history .\nIf you live in the collective West or the EU , you know that the energy crisis is now a reality .\nThe real question is : is all of this by simply by happenstance , or is it being done by design ?\nAnd can it be traced back to a much older global agenda , and forward through to the WEF \u2019 s Great Reset ?\nThe answer to all those questions is course , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this issue .\nFor Brussels and Berlin , this \u2018 green \u2019 road to energy scarcity pure economic suicide .\nRather than change this policy course and work to stabilise global energy and agricultural markets \u2013 the gallant virtue-signalling West has opted instead to double-down on their precarious stance by further tightening anti-Russian sanctions , as well as pursue even deeper commitments towards de-nulearisation and the not-so-green \u2018 Net Zero \u2019 carbon reduction agenda .\nThe cancelation of Russia , coupled with the disastrous \u2018 green \u2019 energy policies are only accelerating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a recipe for disaster \u2013 all due to policies directly created by western governments .\nBy blocking inbound energy supplies from the Nordstream and other Russian pipelines which supplied them with affordable and reliable gas and oil into the EU , Europe has painted itself into a very perilous corner .\nBehind the energy wars and even beyond Klaus Schwab \u2019 s globalist facade \u2013 you will find hardcore geopolitics at play .\nThe main Anglo-American objective : the deindustrialization of Germany and EU , the separation of Russian resources and political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in truly perilous times .\n1 .\nThe Ukraine War \u2013 In late February 2022 , the unthinkable happened : Russia launched its military intervention into neighboring Ukraine .\nWhile Russia seems intent on seeing its \u201c Special Military Operation \u201d through , the US and its allies are going to have to decide just how long they plan to fight Russia down to the last Ukrainian .\nWelcome to NATO \u2019 s ultimate proxy war of attrition in Ukraine , driven by the greatest western media propaganda campaign of all-time .\nSuffice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) alliance are now at war \u2013 with each party firmly in the belief that they are fighting an existential war , not over any particular political or territorial dispute , but for the future existence of their countries , or in the case of NATO , over their ability to maintain regional hegemony for the Atlanticist power bloc .\nWill this near frozen conflict escalate to a WWIII situation , or a thermo-nuclear exchange between the great powers ?\nThe US and British invasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particularly pertinent and telling counterpoint to events in Ukraine .\nThen , as now , the \u2018 free and democratic Western World \u2019 was supposedly faced with a dangerous , unhinged despot in Saddam Hussein , who , like Putin is said to be unwilling to compromise .\nIt \u2019 s a well-worn script for the West , and will likely remain the justification of another endless war .\nOf course , Ukraine \u2019 s President Zelensky could end it all tomorrow if he declared his intentions to disavow any NATO aspirations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukraine a neutral state .\nSuch a declaration would certainly be welcome by Russia today , but the West are determined to keep this proxy war going , and cancel Russia from the global economic system .\nBesides , business is just too good for Ukraine who have managed scrape more than $ 100 billion from the US and EU treasuries so far , not to mention the billions in profits for shareholders in the US defense industry .\nOh , and on the backend of this war , the WEF and BlackRock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as private oligarchs hatch their plan to carve up and reshape the post-war landscape there .\nThe future world order is at stake .\nWhat an unbelievable year .\nExpect some seriously impactful moments in 2023 .\nPLEASE HELP SUPPORT OUR WINTER FUNDRAISING DRIVE HERE", "author": "NEWS WIRE", "url":
