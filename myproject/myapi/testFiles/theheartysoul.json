?\nBecause foods that provide a lot of nutrients , such as lean proteins , vegetables , fruits , and grains , also cause gas .\nThis is particularly true for certain types of carbohydrates that can not be broken down in your digestive tract .\nThese carbohydrates sit in your large intestine for a bit and ferment , until you have a bowel movement .\nSome examples of foods that tend to cause gas include : \u2022 Fructose-containing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar found in fruits like figs , dates , prunes , pears , and grapes .\nIt is also present in smaller amounts in vegetables like onions , artichokes , asparagus , and wheat .\nIt is also added to soft drinks , fruit drinks , and some cookies and cakes .\n\u2022 Raffinose : raffinose is a complex sugar present in many cruciferous vegetables like

a healthy diet .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it may be time to look at your diet and make some healthy changes .\nYou collect gas in your digestive tract as you eat , chew , swallow , and digest food .\nToo much

.\nBy all accounts , solar energy should be our first choice for heating our water and homes and powering our cars , but there \u2019 s just one problem that has stumped the solar industry for quite some time \u2013 the issue of storage .\nScientists have struggled to find a cheap and efficient way to store the energy generated by solar power for the long term .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ team from Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden has developed a specialized solar thermal fuel that can store energy from the sun for up to eighteen years [ 1 ] .\nIt \u2019 s essentially a liquid that can store solar energy .\nThis thermal fuel is actually a molecule , called norbornadiene ( pronounced nor-born-a-dye-een ) in liquid form , and the team at Chalmers has been working on improving it since 2018 [ 2 ] .\nUntil now , the best method we have come up with to store solar energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nTesla has been leading the charge in developing this technology , and while it is very effective , it

sunlight.\n\u201d A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battery , but instead of electricity , you put sunlight in and get heat out , triggered on demand , \u201d says Jeffrey Grossman , who leads a lab at MIT that works on such materials [ 9 ] .\nRead : World \u2019 s Largest Solar Farm to Be Built in Australia \u2013 But They Won \u2019 t Get The Power This new technology uses a process called photoisomerization to convert norbornadiene ( NBD ) into its isomer , quadricyclane ( QC ) [ 4 ] .\nBefore going any further , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight : Isomers are two molecules that are made up of the same atoms ( let \u2019 s say , they have the same \u201c ingredients \u201d ) , but these atoms are arranged differently in space [ 5 ] .\nThink of isomers like a pair of gloves : both gloves have four fingers and a thumb , but a right-hand glove will only fit the right hand , and a left-hand glove will only the left hand .\nIn this case , our two isomers are norbornadiene ( NBD ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up of hydrogen , carbon , and nitrogen , but these atoms are in different sequences [ 6 ] .\nPhotoisomerization occurs when the molecules in one isomer ( NBD ) absorb sunlight and become excited .\nThis causes them to rearrange themselves to become a new isomer , in this case QC .\nWhen NBD is converted to its isomer QC , energy gets trapped within the molecule .\nThis new energized molecule is stable and has strong chemical bonds , which is why it can store that energy for such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important aspect of this process is that it can be reversed [ 7 ] .\nThe ability to store that energy is incredibly important , but once it \u2019 s stored , what \u2019 s the point of having it if you can \u2019 t get it back out ?\nIts like locking something in a safe and then losing the key .\nIn order to get the energy that was trapped in the QC molecule , you have to convert it back to NBD .\nTo do this , the team at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catalyst to rearrange the molecules back to their original state [ 8 ] .\nThis process causes the molecule to release energy in the form of heat .\nThe scientists working on the project found that when the molecule was passed through a catalyst , it heated up the fuel by 63 degrees Celsius , or 113 degrees Fahrenheit [ 8 ] .\nThis liquid heat could be used to heat homes , offices , public spaces , and much more .\nThis liquid can store solar energy in uninsulated tanks inside houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucked or piped between cities and solar farms .\nKasper Moth-Poulson , one of the team members working on the project , explains that both the fuel and the catalyst experience very little damage during the process , which allows them to run the system in a closed loop , picking up sunlight and dropping off heat over and over again .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve run it though 125 cycles without any significant degradation , \u201d Moth-Poulsen says [ 9 ] .\nPer kilogram , this fuel can store up to 250-watt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the capacity of the Tesla Powerwall

almost black skin .\nUnlike most grapes , these were invented in 2004 by International Fruit Genetics ( IFG ) , an organization founded by Dr. David Cain in 2000 .\nThe grapes came about through agricultural experimentation ( but without any kind of genetic modification . )\nThey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce when nudged in the right direction .\nMoon Drop grapes were originally called IFG Six while they were under development by International Fruit Genetics .\nThey were created through a process called \u201c embryo rescue \u201d .\nIt involves growing seed embryos in a cultured medium , similar to how seedless grapes are grown .\nThen the seedlings are planted into regular soil and grown with the typical farming practices .\nThe grapes have never been altered genetically ; the unique color and shape are a natural result of the breeding process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ] IFG originally patented the grapes as Sweet Sapphires but the name Moon Drop grapes came from store labeling .\nPerhaps it came due to their slight similarity to a water drop .\nSome stores labeled them as teardrop grapes or witch \u2019 s fingers .\nThey are also easily identified as \u201c long grapes.\n\u201d Unfortunately

shield the grapes from the rain , allowing them to keep growing for longer than typical grape varieties , which results in their richly sweet flavor .\nThey are comparable to Cotton Candy grapes , which were also created by IFG after years of artificial hybridization .\nAlso , Moon Drop grapes are seedless with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them a crunchy snack that may appeal to people who struggle with eating foods with inconsistent textures .\nIn fact , the grapes are so firm , they could be snapped in half .\n[ 2 ] Read : The Benefits of Eating Eggs ( Even Everyday ) Researchers have yet to

noteworthy .\nIt can help reduce inflammation and oxidative stress , which can potentially fight against heart disease , cancer , and brain diseases like dementia , according to early studies .\nGrapes can also aid heart health since they are low in sodium and high in potassium , and both traits contribute to balanced blood pressure .\nPotassium , as well as vitamin K , helps maintain

about many symptoms of gynecologic cancers is that they can also be a sign for a number of other issues , both serious and non-serious .\nIt can sometimes be hard to decide whether what you are

include getting full really quickly or having a hard time eating and back or abdominal pain .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloating , speak to your doctor .\nAgain , pain , pressure , and discomfort are all premenstrual and menstrual symptoms .\nPay attention , however , if this pressure and discomfort seems more than usual , lasts longer , or is occurring out of your regular \u201c period symptom window \u201d .\nRemember , anytime a symptom is constant or persistent , it could be a sign that something else is going on .\nWhere vulvar cancer is concerned , itching , burning , pain , or tenderness of the vulva are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay attention to a change in color of the vulva or the skin .\nThis could be in the form of a rash , sores , or warts .\nRead : How to Eat to Reduce Cancer Risk Breast

.\nThe Bottom Line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health The signs and symptoms of gynecologic cancers are often easy to ignore because many can be symptoms of other things .\nWe , as women , have also become used to
