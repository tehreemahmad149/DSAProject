correct , patient outcomes could be improved with existing antioxidant supplements .\nA number of readily available supplements help support mitochondrial function , including CoQ10 and ubiquinol , L-carnitine , arginine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitamin E , vitamin K , B vitamins , selenium , and NADH .\nUnfortunately , the FDA is threatening precisely the kind of antioxidant that could help with COVID , N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) , by declaring that it is not a dietary supplement .\nThe FDA \u2019 s declaration was challenged by two Citizens Petitions from the supplement industry .\nWe \u2019 ve

FDA alleging the agency is engaging in an unlawful application of the Food , Drug , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why the FDA is attacking NAC in the first place .\nIn previous coverage , we noted that there are 17 trials looking at NAC , in both drug and supplement form , for the treatment of COVID .\nAdditionally , there are over 50 trials looking at NAC for a variety of other conditions .\nGiven these facts , it seems obvious that the FDA is setting the stage for a new NAC drug to come to market by removing the competition from much cheaper NAC supplements .\nIt is encouraging to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplements like NAC to prevent and treat diseases like COVID .\nIt is equally maddening to witness the government \u2019 s dogged commitment to suppress this kind of evidence for affordable

that exposures to microplastics can result in inflammation , oxidative stress ( which causes cell tissue to break down and DNA damage ) , and adverse effects on the immune system .\nOther studies have

microplastics to protect our health include vacuuming regularly with HEPA filters to remove plastics from our living space .\nSome companies market air purifiers that purport to remove some

expensive drug for COVID-19 .\nAction Alert !\nThe study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine , and shows results suggesting that remdesivir , the drug heralded by Dr. Anthony Fauci as the \u201c new standard of care \u201d for COVID in April 2020 , can be effectively used in non-hospitalized COVID patients .\nIt has also been picked up and disseminated by the media .\nIt may not be long until organizations like the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 treatment guidelines to recommend wider use of remdesivir as one of the only FDA approved treatments for COVID .\nIt is par for the course that a toxic drug like remdesivir is pushed by doctors and the government , while information on safe , inexpensive supplements is ruthlessly censored and suppressed .\nRemdesivir received an emergency use authorization in May 2020 and full FDA approval in October 2020 despite modest effectiveness\u2014and that \u2019 s putting it kindly .\nIt was also approved under dubious circumstances chronicled in Robert Kennedy Jr. \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Despite insisting on randomized , placebo-controlled clinical trials before hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin could be recommended for COVID , Dr. Fauci gave the OK to remdesivir following trials in which the control group did not receive a real placebo .\nWhen the drug was shown to reduce COVID mortality by just 3.6 percent , Dr. Fauci \u2019 s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease decided to judge the drug instead on how long it took surviving patients to recover : remdesivir patients recovered in 10 days , while placebo patients recovered in 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction in mortality compared to placebo , it \u2019 s no surprise the government needed another metric to demonstrate success .\nYet , according to Kennedy \u2019 s book , even this was fraudulent : almost twice as many remdesivir subjects in the trial as placebo subjects had to be readmitted to the hospital after discharge , suggesting that the improved recovery time could be due to patients being discharged too early .\nSubsequently , a World Health Organization study on remdesivir including 11,000 people found the drug did not prevent COVID deaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered no clinical benefit to hospitalized COVID patients and was associated with increased hospital stays .\nSo remdesivir \u2019 s efficacy is highly questionable , what about its safety ?\nThe drug has been associated with a wide array of nasty side effects , including : respiratory toxicity , cardiovascular toxicity ( hypertension , atrial fibrillation , cardiac arrest ) , nephrotoxicity ( acute kidney injury , renal impairments ) , and gastrointestinal symptoms , to name a few .\nIn earlier trials when the drug was tested against Ebola , subjects taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organ failure , and septic shock , with 54 percent of the remdesivir group dying , the highest mortality rate among the four experimental drugs .\nThe fact that any medical professionals could even be considering using this drug more widely is a testament to how broken our medical system is .\nWe \u2019 ve written before about the off-patent drugs that have demonstrated incredible effectiveness against COVID-19 , not to mention the scores of readily available supplements that show great promise for treating and preventing COVID .\nBut because these medicines don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government throttles our access .\nMeanwhile , remdesivir costs $ 3,120 per patient .\nCongress is getting in on it too : as we told you last year , some in Congress are working on policy that would result in restricted consumer access to supplements .\nThis policy would require supplement companies to comply with a \u201c master filing \u201d requirement that would allow the FDA to create a list of all the supplements on the market .\nWhen this list is coupled with the FDA \u2019 s \u201c new supplement \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dire threat to your supplement access .\nMany supplements currently on the market could actually be considered \u201c new supplements \u201d by the FDA and thus targets for elimination if they don \u2019 t comply with the FDA \u2019 s rules , which are akin to a pre-approval system for drugs .\nExperts have estimated that the FDA \u2019 s overreaching \u201c new supplement \u201d policies threaten as many as 41,700 supplements ( you can read more about the problems with this policy here ) .\nWe also wrote recently about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another supplement that has demonstrated great promise for COVID .\nIf the FDA has a list of all supplements on the market , its job of targeting NAC products , or products that don \u2019 t comply with the agency \u2019 s onerous \u201c new supplement \u201d guidance , is that much easier .\nWe must preserve

!\nEarlier this month , the FDA announced it will allow a health claim regarding magnesium and hypertension .\nThe agency admits there is scientific support that magnesium helps with high blood pressure\u2026but the evidence is \u201c inconsistent and inconclusive.\n\u201d Huh ?\nRather than using qualifiers to downplay the evidence for magnesium , shouldn \u2019 t the FDA , a public health agency , be more concerned about the fact that nearly half of American adults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure increases the risk for heart disease and stroke , which are the leading causes of death in this country .\nShouldn \u2019 t the FDA be thrilled that there is a lot of credible evidence that a nutrient as safe , affordable and readily available as magnesium can help with lowering blood pressure and preventing coronary artery disease ?\nUnfortunately , we have yet another example of the FDA being more concerned with protecting drug industry profits than with promoting public health through the use of safe , effective , and affordable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action was in response to a petition to allow what was already a measured health claim about magnesium : \u201c Supportive but inconclusive scientific evidence suggests that diets with adequate magnesium may reduce the risk of high blood pressure ( hypertension ) , a condition associated with many factors.\n\u201d This , according to the FDA , went too far !\nInstead , the agency will allow companies to say that \u201c inconsistent and inconclusive evidence \u201d suggests that magnesium \u201c may \u201d reduce the risk of high blood pressure .\nIn detailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FDA seems to contradict the findings of agencies less influenced by the drug industry .\nTo reach its determination , the FDA reviewed 88 publications .\nFifteen studies were disregarded because the subjects had hypomagnesaemia , those with abnormally low concentrations of magnesium in their blood , which , the FDA claims , is not representative of the general population .\nYet government surveys , as part of a joint effort from the Departments of Health and Agriculture , have found that 60 percent of Americans do not ingest enough magnesium to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans are , indeed , deficient , yet the FDA seems unwilling to acknowledge this basic truth .\nWhy does this matter ?\nHypertension is one of the top risk factors for heart disease , the leading cause of death both worldwide and in the US .\nHigh blood pressure can be caused by several conditions , such as the inflexibility of blood vessels , hardening of arteries , and an overactive stress response ; low magnesium impacts all of these factors .\nThe scientific evidence on magnesium and heart health is extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2020 concluded that low magnesium was a significant

subjects found that supplementation with magnesium reduces blood pressure in hypertensive patients .\n\u2022 Studies have demonstrated an association between low magnesium and risk for heart attack

\u201d indeed !\nOther evidence has found that low magnesium is associated with arterial fibrillation , which occurs when a malfunction in the heart \u2019 s electrical system causes the upper chambers of the heart to quiver .\nPart of the problem is that standard blood tests vastly underestimate magnesium insufficiency .\nThe current \u201c normal \u201d range was established based on magnesium levels gathered by a study between 1971 and 1974 of \u201c presumably healthy \u201d individuals\u2014but what constitutes healthy ?\nOne review of this topic concluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference interval for the serum magnesium is flawed by the large number of \u2018 normal \u2019 individuals who have a subtle chronic negative magnesium balance due to a significant decrease in magnesium intake over the past century .\nCommon drugs also deplete magnesium .\nAcid blockers like Prevacid , Nexium , and Prilosec , which are taken by more than 15 million Americans , are now required to carry a block box warning indicating they can cause magnesium deficiency .\nDiuretics , commonly used for high blood pressure , can also reduce magnesium\u2014which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cited above .\nWith regard to the FDA \u2019 s action , it may be relevant to state that the global market for antihypertensive drugs will grow to nearly $ 26.3 billion .\nEx-FDA officials have stated that the FDA sees the drug industry as its client and represents its interests .\nThis is the same agency that went after cherry and walnut growers for citing peer-reviewed studies about the benefits of

this agency doing nothing to protect us ?\nAction Alert !\nAn analysis by the World Health Institute found that , in 2019 , chemical exposures resulted in the death of 2 million people globally and the loss of 53 million disability adjusted life-years .\nThis is likely vastly underestimating the problem , since the science is only just now emerging on the dangers of being exposed to even low levels of endocrine disruptors and chemicals used in plastics .\nWhy isn \u2019 t the EPA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corruption and regulatory capture at the EPA show that this agency is entirely unequipped to protect Americans from the thousands of dangerous chemicals that are making us sick .\nFirst , there \u2019 s the revolving door between EPA and the industries it regulates .\nAgency officials often move to lucrative careers at chemical companies , a fact they understand while working as regulators of that industry .\nConversely , industry executives are often appointed to important positions within the EPA .\nOpen Secrets has identified 208 people at the EPA who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can the public be adequately protected when agency officials are promised lucrative jobs in exchange for doing industry \u2019 s bidding while in government , or when oil , gas , and coal executives are given leadership positions within the agency ?\nThis kind of corruption helps keep dangerous chemicals

Services Department ( HHS ) to conduct its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful\u2014the HHS review never happened .\nA letter from a former EPA employee dying of cancer accused Rowland of having intimidated staff , compelling them to change reports to make them favorable to Monsanto .\nIt will be interesting to see where Rowland ends up after his tenure at the EPA .\nThe rules of the game are also rigged in industry \u2019 s favor because industry gets to write the rules .\nWhen the law governing chemical regulation was updated in 2016 , it was with the support of the chemical industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that eventually became law were circulated , the authoring information in the Word document indicated that it originated with the American Chemistry Council , the trade group and lobbyist for the chemical industry .\nThe sponsor of the bill , former Senator Tom Udall ( D-NM ) and the other sixteen cosponsors of that legislation received an average of 70 percent more in campaign contributions from chemical companies than other senators .\nThe update to toxic chemicals policy in 2016 was touted as a reform to a broken system , but in reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemical industry \u2019 s influence noted above .\nThe 2016 \u201c reform \u201d retained the original safety standard , allowing the EPA to take action against a chemical if it is found to present an \u201c unreasonable risk of injury to health , \u201d a term which is not defined .\nIt is a slight improvement over the original act passed in 1976 , which in practice forced the EPA to undergo a cost-benefit analysis before it banned a chemical : is the likelihood of injury from the chemical greater than the economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s use ?\nThis standard was designed to limit action against harmful chemicals : the burden of proof was so difficult that the EPA couldn \u2019 t ban asbestos , a known carcinogen that kills 15,000 people a year .\nThe 2016 law did away with the cost-benefit analysis in theory , but

previously construed in case law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , the reform did almost nothing to change the standards by which the EPA regulates chemicals .\nThe 2016 \u201c reform \u201d did change the law on what state actions could be preempted by EPA actions on chemicals .\nIt is a complex issue , but simply put : the new law bars states from regulating or restricting a chemical if the EPA has found that it does not pose an unreasonable risk to human health .\nLike the GMO labeling law , the chemical reform legislation took power away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the EPA failed to do so .\nThe 2016 reform requires the EPA to test unregulated chemicals currently on the market and the thousands of new chemicals that come to the market every year\u2026at the rate of 20 chemicals at a time , each with a seven-year deadline .\nIndustry then has five years to comply after a new rule is made .\nOf the 84,000 chemicals currently on the market , the EPA has banned or restricted only a handful of chemicals since 1976 .\nThis would be comical if it wasn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk .\nAll of this shows that we can not rely on the federal government to protect us , and we must take steps to educate ourselves to avoid , as best we can , the dangerous chemicals that abound in modern society .\nIt is our exposure to chemical toxins and pollutants , in addition to poor diet and foods grown in nutrient depleted soil , that has helped create an epidemic of chronic disease .\nOur healthcare system is overburdened trying to address these chronic ailments with pharmaceutical drugs that are @ @

CDC ) .\nAction Alert !\nThe CDC recently proposed an updated set of recommendations for how and when to prescribe opioid medications .\nDoctors are , and should be , free to prescribe what they feel is necessary to help their patients\u2014but should the federal government be recommending any opioid use in the midst of one of the worst addiction and overdose crises in history\u2014particularly when agencies like the FDA played such a key role in the development of this crisis ?\nStill worse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evaluated in the CDC \u2019 s guidelines .\nThe overall message of the sprawling , 211-page document is that doctors should use non-opioid treatments first for both chronic and acute pain .\nThese include over-the-counter drugs like ibuprofen , massage , exercise , and even acupuncture .\nDoctors should prescribe opioids for chronic pain patients only if expected benefits ( like the ability to do everyday tasks ) outweigh the calamitous risks , including addiction , overdose , heart problems , and more .\nWhether doctors , in their clinical judgment , choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the federal government to be recommending the use of opioids , even in a limited fashion , reeks of cronyism , given the sordid history of the FDA aiding and abetting Big Pharma in creating this crisis .\nThis history has been expounded upon in detail , particularly following the avalanche of lawsuits in recent years .\nHere are some of the highlights ( or , rather , lowlights ) : \u2022 When extended-release OxyContin was approved in 1995 , safety studies showed that the drug was effective and safe mostly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain .\nYet the FDA approved the drug for a much broader treatment of chronic pain , including everything from fibromyalgia to back pain .\n\u2022 There were no clinical trials to show OxyContin was less addictive than other opioids , but the FDA allowed Purdue , the manufacturer , to claim that the drug was \u201c believed to reduce the abuse liability \u201d and that addiction was \u201c rare.\n\u201d These claims allowed Purdue to launch a multi-million dollar advertising campaign , pushing their drug as safer than any competitor .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the FDA \u2019 s approved OxyContin label was a \u201c blank check \u201d that resulted in billions in additional sales .\n\u2022 As the evidence mounted that opioid prescribing was outpacing clinical need and overdoses were skyrocketing , the FDA convened an advisory panel of ten experts tasked with recommending whether the agency should forbid dispensing opioids for chronic pain .\nLeft unmentioned by the FDA was that five of the panelists had connections to Purdue as consultants or paid speakers ; three others had similar connections to the opioid industry .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ FDA \u2019 s opioid labeling .\nIt took another six years for the FDA to remove OxyContin \u2019 s label claim that addiction was rare .\n\u2022 In the following years , the FDA continued to approve new , more powerful opioids .\nEven when advisory panels overwhelmingly voted against approval , top FDA officials , including then-FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock , pushed them through .\nThe leader of an opioid advisory committee told reporters that the \u201c lack of insight\u2026exhibited by the agency is in many ways a willful blindness that borders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now the leading cause of death for Americans under the age of 50 .\nPurdue Pharma , maker of OxyContin , made $ 10 billion from the sale of opioids\u2014and that \u2019 s just one among several drug makers who made astronomical sums from the sale of these drugs .\nThere is a missed opportunity , or opportunities , in these recommendations for doctors to use proven natural therapies to manage pain .\nNatural treatments can not always replace opioids , but they can be a first option for many patients because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did evaluate acupuncture , exercise , massage , yoga , and cognitive behavior therapy as options , but these just scratch the surface of what is available in the natural medicine toolkit .\nFirst , CBD , one of the compounds found in the hemp plant , has shown great promise in pain management .\nA recent study found that a significant number of people with fibromyalgia are finding an effective replacement in CBD-containing products .\nIn that study , more than 70 % of people with fibromyalgia who used CBD for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other pain medications .\nOf those participants , many reported that they either decreased use or stopped taking opioids and other pain medications as a result .\nThis is supported by other research showing CBD \u2019 s pain-relieving properties .\nOther natural options ignored by the CDC : \u2022 Homeopathy offers numerous customized approaches to the management or elimination of pain .\nFor example , a study published in Rheumatology found statistically significant results from homeopathic treatment of people with fibromyalgia .\n\u2022 Medical foods provide specific nutritional requirements for the management of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be met by diet alone .\nMedical foods often manage the underlying metabolic cause of a disease or condition , not just the resulting symptoms .\nUsed under medical supervision , medical foods should be considered part of effective management best practices for diseases and conditions that can lead to chronic pain .\nFor example , Limbrel is a medical food for the treatment of osteoarthritis that contains safe ingredients like Chinese skullcap and catechin .\n\u2022 Ozone therapy is the injection of oxygen gas ( ozone ) into affected areas .\nOzone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxygen metabolism , activate the immune system , and to help with chronic pain and inflammation .\n\u2022 Hyperbaric oxygen therapy , or HBOT , ( pressurized oxygen ) may help with pain by flooding wounded tissue with the oxygen it needs to repair itself .\n\u2022 A variety of dietary supplements have evidence to recommend them for pain , including : curcumin , Indian frankincense , black sesame seeds , omega-3 fatty acids , Palmitoylethanolamide ( PEA ) , Gamma linolenic acid ( GLA ) Methylsulfonylmethane ( MSM ) , capsaicin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and B vitamins , to name a few .\nWe \u2019 re doing patients with pain a great disservice by ignoring these options .\nEight percent of adults\u201416 million Americans in total\u2014have chronic back pain ; 24 percent of Americans , or 58.5 million people , have arthritis ; and 4 million people , or 2 percent of the population , have fibromyalgia .\nWe must offer these patients the full bevy of options to manage their pain , including safe and non-addictive natural therapies such as those listed above .\nUntil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can not expect to get a handle on the addiction crisis that is killing us in record numbers .\nAction Alert !\nWrite to the CDC and urge them to include natural options in their alternatives to opioid medications .\nPlease send your message immediately .", "author": "ANH-USA", "url":

to inject themselves into our lives without any accountability\u2014it \u2019 s time for it to stop .\nAction Alert !\nWe are increasingly subject to rules and decrees that are undemocratically ( and perhaps illegally ) issued from federal agencies like the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) , the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , and the Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) .\nThere are tens of thousands of these types of actions , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undemocratically injecting itself into our personal lives , our businesses , and our communities\u2014and if we don \u2019 t like some of these rules , there isn \u2019 t much we can do to challenge them .\nWe must reform the system to prevent these intrusions .\nFederal agencies commonly ignore the normal rulemaking process to avoid its requirements and instead issue \u201c non-binding \u201d guidance documents that , in practice , are in fact binding and must be followed\u2014but are more difficult for the public to challenge .\nThis abuse of power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country , most notably our ability to access natural products like supplements and information about their benefits .\nHere are some examples : \u2022 Through issuing a guidance , the FDA has arbitrarily limited the kind of evidence that can be used to substantiate certain health claims .\nThis ensures that nearly all qualified health claims are rejected , limiting the information available to consumers about products that can support their health .\n\u2022 The FDA has declared , through guidance , that all homeopathic medicines are being marketed illegally .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prioritizes enforcement against certain products , such as injectable homeopathic products .\nThe guidance has language saying it is \u201c non-binding , \u201d yet actions have already been taken against manufacturers of homeopathic products based on this guidance .\nHere \u2019 s how our system is supposed to work : we , the people , elect lawmakers , those lawmakers enact legislation , and federal agencies ( like the FDA , EPA , and USDA ) create rules to implement the laws passed by our representatives in an open and public process .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Water Act creating the framework for regulating discharges of pollutants in our waterways ; the EPA then is tasked with creating the rules to implement these laws in a process that allows the public to weigh in , provide feedback , and , if necessary , challenge the rule in court .\nThe Administrative Procedures Act ( APA ) governs this rulemaking process , requiring agencies to frame the problem a regulation is supposed to solve , analyze alternative solutions , conduct an economic analysis , solicit public comments , and minimize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cumbersome as this process can be , it is critical to an open and democratic system in which agencies , whose officials are not elected , are held accountable .\nSpecifically , the process allows citizens recourse if agencies do not follow proper notice-and-comment procedures , if agency actions are considered \u201c arbitrary and capricious , \u201d if the agency action is against the law or Constitution , or if there is an unreasonable delay in agency decision-making .\nToo often , however , agencies avoid these difficult but important requirements by issuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules or statements issued by an agency to advise the public of the agency \u2019 s interpretation of the laws passed by Congress .\nThese actions are exempted from APA requirements , meaning there is no recourse if the public or regulated industry wants to challenge the interpretation .\nThese decrees are often couched in tentative and voluntary terms .\nFor example , FDA guidance documents commonly state that they \u201c contain non-binding recommendations.\n\u201d This matters because regulated entities end up essentially forced to follow guidance as though it were law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can challenge it .\nAccording to one commentator , \u201c Regardless of the language and the format , the effect is the same for regulated entities .\nThe agency suggests that you do something \u2014 even if it says that it might suggest something different later \u2014 and you do it.\n\u201d Why does all of this matter ?\nBroadly speaking , agencies are usurping legislative power from Congress .\nWe didn \u2019 t elect anybody in the FDA , yet in practice the agency is creating policy through guidance documents not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to challenge .\nThe most glaring example of this abuse of power , for us , is the FDA \u2019 s \u201c new supplement \u201d guidance .\nWe \u2019 ve argued that the new supplement guidance goes well beyond an interpretation , and we believe it is in fact a legislative rule with legal implications because the FDA goes far beyond the law Congress passed , threatening tens of thousands of supplements .\nThe guidance alters and broadens the meaning of what qualifies as a new supplement and creates new\u2014and very expensive\u2014requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process ( creating what we would call a de facto pre-approval system ) , counter to what is outlined in the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act ( DSHEA ) .\nFurther , not fulfilling the new supplement notification requirements outlined in the guidance ensures that the supplement will be considered adulterated and therefore illegal .\nThis indicates there \u2019 s a clear , legally binding impact to the new supplement guidance .\nBecause the new supplement policies have been set forth in a guidance rather than a formal rule , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is far from an isolated example .\nOne 2018 analysis found 608 significant guidance documents in effect across all federal agencies which , the author notes , is not a comprehensive list .\nThere have been some attempts to address this injustice .\nA federal bill , The Guidance Clarity Act of 2021 , would mandate that all agency guidance documents include the following statement : \u201c The contents of this document do not have the force and effect of law and do not , of themselves , bind the public or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements under the law or agency policies.\n\u201d This at least identifies the problem , but lacks real teeth to really change anything .\nTo protect our access to important supplements , and to end a fundamentally undemocratic , un-constitutional practice , we must address this abuse of power .\nAction Alert !\nWrite to Congress and tell them to enact legislation that prohibits agencies from legislating through the issuance of guidance and other \u201c non-binding \u201d policy statements .\nPlease send your message immediately @", "author":

assaults that damage the rhizosphere will lead to less nutritious food .\nNutrient-depleted food is also why we need access to a wide variety of dietary supplements .\nJust as our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so are humans .\nGovernment surveys have found that wide swaths of the American population do not get enough nutrients like magnesium vitamins D , E , and K , potassium , and choline , to name just a few examples .\nSupplements can help fill these nutritional gaps , but government policies are threatening our access to these health-promoting products .\nWhy Does It Matter That Today \u2019 s Oranges Have Less Vitamin A ?\nPlant health has profound impacts on human health .\nAccording to the government \u2019 s own figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a variety of key micronutrients .\nResearch shows that micronutrient inadequacies predispose us to many chronic diseases like cancer , cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes , and yes , COVID .\nCertain populations are even more vulnerable to micronutrient deficiencies , including people of low socioeconomic status that experience food insecurity , women , African Americans , indigenous people , and older Americans , to name a few .\nLong term users of pharmaceutical drugs may also have an impaired ability to absorb nutrients from food .\nFor example , long term use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnesium absorption ( you can check out coverage of our petition to get the FDA to warn about the danger of pneumonia with acid blocker use here ) .\nThe degraded nature of our food is surely connected to the chronic disease epidemic that has exploded in this country .\nAbout one half of Americans have at least one preventable chronic disease ; one third of adults and 17 percent of children and adolescents are obese .\nWhen only one in ten Americans meet government recommendations for daily fruit and vegetable intake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not giving us the amount of micronutrients we need , it is no wonder that we are such a sick nation .\nNever has there been a more dire reminder that food is medicine\u2014which is why government policies threatening our supplement access are so unconscionable , particularly from agencies that are supposed to be committed to protecting public health .\nSenator Dick Durbin ( D-IL ) is leading an effort to create a new requirement for the supplement industry called mandatory product listing\u2014you can read about the many problems with this policy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decline of soil health and the nutrient content of our food can be traced to a few federal policies .\nFirst , agricultural subsidies encourage monocropping that diminishes soil health and encourages growing wheat , corn , and soy over healthy fruits and vegetables .\nEvery year , the government spends billions on agricultural subsidies to support commodity crops like corn , wheat , cotton , and soy .\nIncentivizing the cultivation of these crops supports degenerative farming practices including the application of synthetic fertilizers and herbicides and tillage .\nAll these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less nutritious food .\nSubsidies discourage crop rotation in favor of planting only a subsidized crop , which in turn can lead to increased use of fertilizers , which negatively affect the rhizosphere and degrade soil .\nTillage involves agitating the soil to prepare for seeding , but it also rips apart plant roots that feed soil microbes , once again disrupting the rhizosphere so crucial to healthy plant development .\nAgricultural subsidies are enriching large agribusinesses .\nBetween 1995 and 2019 , the top 10 percent of subsidy recipients received 78 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFifty people on the Forbes 400 list of the wealthiest Americans received farm subsidies ; 62 percent of US farms did not receive any subsidies .\nWhile the government works to make large agribusinesses rich , the USDA fails to support farmers who are growing healthy food because it does not properly enforce organic standards .\nConcentrated animal feeding operations ( CAFOs ) are able to game the system in a variety of ways to pass off their products as \u201c organic \u201d and sell them for a fraction of the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving small , organic farmers who care deeply for the principles of organic farming out of business .\nFor example , government inspectors found 14 \u201c willful violations \u201d of organic standards at Aurora Organic Dairy , one of the largest \u201c organic \u201d dairy operations .\nUsually just one violation is enough to lose organic certification , but politicians stepped in to make sure Aurora could continue taking advantage of the USDA \u2019 s organic label .\nNot only do CAFOs themselves harm soil health ; most of the commodity crops grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for animal feeds to support these massive operations .\nUnder the USDA \u2019 s watch , CAFOs are becoming the standard in agriculture .\nIn 1990 , small and medium-sized farms accounted for half of all agricultural production ; now it is less than a quarter .\nHydroponics Another example of USDA capitulation is allowing hydroponically-grown food to be considered organic .\nHydroponics is a technology for growing plants in water with dissolved fertilizers rather than actual soil .\nProduce grown hydroponically is often produced in massive warehouses under artificial lighting .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can come from a variety of sources , including highly processed GMO soybeans .\nThis is a betrayal of organic principles because soil is at the heart of organic production and healthy food , as explained above .\nIt is also another way in which the government is helping large companies get richer .\nThese companies can afford to build massive greenhouse complexes to grow hydroponic tomatoes and berries , and then charge less for them than organic produce from small farmers being good stewards of the land .\nWhy does the federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small , organic farmers ?\nBig Ag is a powerful player on Capitol Hill represented by over a thousand lobbyists .\nIn 2019 Big Ag spent a total of $ 143,344,380 lobbying members of Congress .\nFaced with this influx of money , it is easy for Congress and the USDA to hand out gifts to these special interests and to turn a blind eye when organic standards are subverted\u2014small farmers aren \u2019 t writing them big checks !\nThen , of course , there is the revolving door , when individuals move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWe \u2019 ve written about how this undermines the ability of the FDA to protect the public , but it is also a factor at the USDA .\nA Chief Economist at the USDA recently left to fill a leadership role at the American Sugar Alliance ;

support for additional regulation of supplements .\nOur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mandatory filing \u201d proposal represents to supplement access .\nFor starters , the National Institutes of Health already has a supplement label database , so \u201c mandatory filing \u201d requirements would be a duplicative waste of millions of taxpayer dollars .\nBut the main threat is the way that \u201c mandatory filing \u201d requirements would interplay with other FDA regulations , particularly the \u201c new supplement \u201d regulations that have not yet been completed .\n\u201c Mandatory filing \u201d requirements would give the FDA an easy way to seek out supplements that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c new supplement \u201d guidance and remove those products from the market .\nAs we \u2019 ve explained previously , this guidance is a power grab by the FDA in that it creates a drug-like pre-approval system for \u201c new \u201d supplements when the law simply called for a notification system for these products .\nAccording to an economic analysis , this could mean more than 41,000 supplements are threatened .\nThere is no time to lose .\nWe must reach out to Congress and tell them to oppose this policy !\nAction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to oppose \u201c mandatory filing \u201d for supplements .\nPlease send your message immediately .", "author": "ANH-USA", "url":

linchpin of medical therapy across ALL specialties .\nHere \u2019 s a rundown of how it could advance the health of diverse patients : \u2022 Gastroenterology : Rates of IBS , GERD , inflammatory bowel disease and GI cancers are soaring .\nDiet has a major impact via food intolerance , toxicity of ultra-processed foods , and assaults on microbiome integrity .\nIt \u2019 s now acknowledged that , in addition to traditional gastrointestinal ailments , perturbations in digestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the body .\n\u2022 Endocrinology : This specialty includes the management of diabetes , which has obvious nutritional correlates .\nDiet and lifestyle are paramount in preventing or reversing the consequences of blood sugar dysregulation .\n\u2022 Neurology : Neurodegenerative diseases have taken an increasing toll as our population ages .\nThe discovery of the \u201c gut-brain \u201d axis implicates diet as a driver of brain pathology ; blood sugar regulation may be a cornerstone of dementia prevention ; key nutrients may support brain and nervous system health .\n\u2022 Cardiology : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by major heart organizations may be misguided when it \u2019 s actually excess carbohydrates that deserve the spotlight , it \u2019 s a time-tested proposition that there \u2019 s a diet-heart connection .\nIn addition to prevention of atherosclerosis , key nutrients like omega-3s , magnesium , Aged Garlic Extract , and CoQ10 may support care of patients with heart failure , atrial fibrillation and hypertension .\n\u2022 Rheumatology : New research supports the use of an \u201c anti-inflammatory diet \u201d as well as supplements like vitamin D , omega-3s , and curcumin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dermatology : Skin conditions are often superficial manifestations of systemic allergies and inflammation , which can be modulated by diet change .\n\u2022 Hematology/Oncology : There are obvious influences of diet on cancer prevention ; what is not commonly acknowledged is that diet and supplements can impact the success of conventional therapies , and prolong survival .\n\u2022 Infectious Disease : COVID should have been a teachable moment about the impact of diet on immunity ; avoidance of obesity , the condition of the microbiome , and levels of key nutrients like vitamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape outcomes .\n\u2022 Urology : Diet has a definitive impact on prostate cancer occurrence and survival ; progressive urology programs have begun to offer lifestyle counseling to their prostate cancer patients .\n\u2022 Nephrology : In impaired kidney function , or with patients on dialysis , nutrition plays a crucial role ; nephrologists are way ahead of their medical colleagues in understanding this , and consultation with dieticians is mandatory for renal patients .\n\u2022 Ophthalmology : The pioneering AREDS studies underscored the benefits of nutrition in macular degeneration ; other eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correlates .\n\u2022 ENT/Pulmonology : Food allergies and inflammation stoke respiratory tract diseases ; chronic sinusitis and asthma are often diet-related .\n\u2022 OB-GYN : It \u2019 s obvious that pregnancy outcomes are impacted by diet ; Many gynecological conditions like PMS , endometriosis , PCOS and chronic vaginitis respond to nutritional interventions .\n\u2022 Psychiatry : Nutritional Psychiatry is making great strides .\nThe Food-Mood connection is well established , and certain supplements may be potent tools for alleviating mental conditions .\n\u2022 Pediatrics : Rates of childhood obesity are soaring ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antecedents .\nEarly interventions can stave off adult degenerative diseases .\n\u2022 Surgery : Cue the old adage : \u201c The operation was a success but the patient died.\n\u201d Surgeons acknowledge this , and want nutritionally-replete patients who are more likely to survive the rigors of surgery .\n\u2022 Sports Medicine/Orthopedics : Even in this \u201c spare-parts \u201d oriented field , sports nutrition is emerging as an essential contributor to optimization of athletic performance and rehabilitation .\n\u2022 Dentistry : It was dentist Weston Price , who , in the 1930s traveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document the ravages of transition to a modern diet by members of traditional cultures ; his photos document cavities , gum disease and malocclusion as a result of adoption of industrially-processed refined foods .\nNevertheless , nutrition training and knowledge among medical professionals remains woefully lacking , according to the latest surveys .\nIt \u2019 s not for lack of interest by idealistic young medical students .\nBut by the time they graduate , they \u2019 re ground down by overwhelming demands of memorization and fact regurgitation , exhausted by punishing rotations that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thoroughly indoctrinated in a pharmaceutical paradigm : \u201c Despite the paucity of nutrition curriculum in medical school , the study found that interest among medical students in nutrition is uniformly high .\nPrevious research has shown that keen interest in nutrition among incoming medical students typically wanes by the time of graduation .\nIt is easy to imagine why .\nWhen medical students do not see nutrition substantively incorporated into their curriculum and do not observe clinical mentors incorporating nutritional interventions into their care plans , what else can they conclude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they had once believed ?\n\u201d It \u2019 s not surprising that medical specialists don \u2019 t have the time or bandwidth to become experts in nutrition , except for a few , like myself and colleagues , who have devoted their careers to mastering nutrition science .\nBut , at least , physicians should learn where nutritional approaches are appropriate , and how to make referrals to nutrition experts as part of a team approach : \u201c .\n.\n.\nwithout a solid foundation of clinical nutrition knowledge and skills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even begin to have an informed nutrition conversation with their patients and to fully identify opportunities for referral.\n\u201d But medical education is not addressing the need .\nAccording to survey data : \u201c 22 % of polled physicians recall receiving no nutrition education in medical school .\nWhile the majority of physicians recollect receiving some nutrition education in medical school , 35 % of those polled said that came in the form of a single lecture or a section of a single lecture .\nUnfortunately , the situation does not improve during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveyed felt they received minimal or no education during their medical residency necessary for counseling patients on nutrition topics .\nAnd , despite the urgent need , we \u2019 re lagging behind our international peers : \u201c Lack of nutrition education appears to be more prevalent in the Americas , where 58 % of physicians had no memory of , or there was a notable absence of , nutrition education in medical school .\nIn Asia and Europe , the absence of any education seemed like less of a problem : only 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalled no medical education on nutrition.\n\u201d And after graduation from medical school , things only get worse : \u201c Lack of nutrition education persists after completion of graduate medical education , where almost half of polled physicians had not received any nutrition continuing medical education .\nMoreover , physicians were unlikely to be readers or consumers of nutrition education through studies , books , or documentaries post graduation .\nIn fact , 67 % of physicians read about nutrition less than once every 3 months.\n\u201d \u201c Without adequate education in training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physicians around the world do not feel well equipped to counsel their patients about nutrition.\n\u201d As we commemorate Nutrition Month , we need to do better .\nIs there not an urgent need for training doctors how to harness nutritional modalities , and insist that we place qualified clinical nutritionists on the front lines of EVERY medical specialty ?\nMy professional organization , the American Nutrition Association ( ANA ) has stated : \u201c Nutrition should be a core element of our healthcare culture and system , and all health professionals should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into their work.\n\u201d To this end , the ANA

made clear in a letter responding to 22 members of Congress who expressed concerns that the agency is eliminating access .\nIn its response , the FDA doubled down on every aspect of the flawed report

committee reached the \u201c proper \u201d conclusions .\nUnsurprisingly , NASEM \u2019 s report concluded that cBHRT was a \u201c public health concern.\n\u201d This has no factual basis at all .\nA more recent and comprehensive review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not associated with adverse events and further concluded that cBHRT is effective in the treatment of certain peri-and post-menopausal conditions .\nNASEM \u2019 s report examined only 13 studies , whereas this review looked at 40 articles covering 29 trials comparing cBHRT to conventional hormone products .\nAnother review of the clinical literature concluded that bioidentical hormones are associated with lower risks , including the risk of breast cancer and cardiovascular disease , and are more effective than synthetic or animal-derived hormones .\nMany studies have shown that estriol offers many potential health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example\u2014without some of the dangers that accompany higher-potency estrogens , such as cancer .\nThis is likely because bioidentical hormones are , as the name suggests , chemically identical to those used in the human body .\nOther hormone products are not identical , like Premarin

Alert !\nOne government agency kowtows to special interests to expose us to dangerous chemicals , and another government agency threatens to ban the very products that can help us recover from being exposed to those chemicals .\nNew information sheds further light on the dangers of many ubiquitous cleaning products for human health\u2014products that the EPA is responsible for reviewing for safety .\nAvoiding these products is ideal , but detoxification may be needed using antioxidants like NAC\u2014yet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nutrient .\nWe can not let this happen .\nEveryday household cleaning products emit dangerous pollutants in the air that can negatively affect human health .\nOne recent study found that mopping with common monoterpene-based cleaning products exposes us to as many volatile organic compounds in the air as what you would inhale if you \u2019 re standing on a busy road during rush hour with thousands of cars passing by .\nMonoterpene-based products are common for their citrus scent and are used ubiquitously in cleaning supplies , air fresheners , and perfumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as \u201c essential oils \u201d as well .\nIf something is citrus or pine scented , it likely has monoterpenes .\nAir fresheners , for example , may contain monoterpenes in addition to a host of other dangerous chemicals , including phthalates ( endocrine disruptors ) , formaldehyde ( a carcinogen ) , styrene ( causes cancer and neurotoxicity ) , and VOCs like 1,4 dichlorobenzene ( affects lung function and is a carcinogen ) .\nThe oxidation of monoterpenes has been shown to cause oxidative stress on human cells , negatively affecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the EPA doesn \u2019 t seem to care as much about public health as it does about industry profits .\nThe EPA is responsible for reviewing the safety of products that disinfect and sanitize , but it largely fails at this task .\nAs others have pointed out , the agency \u2019 s safety review process is not equipped to evaluate a product \u2019 s potential for endocrine disruption or neurotoxicity , even though many of these products are linked with these dangers .\nWe \u2019 ve detailed the other reasons for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public from toxic chemicals in earlier coverage .\nAs we reported previously , these chemical exposures affect all of us , but particularly a growing subset of the population with multiple chemical sensitivities ( MCS ) .\nMCS is a condition that affects an estimated 13 percent of the US population , nearly 43 million people .\nThere is a spectrum for chemical sensitivity , with MCS patients representing those who are most vulnerable .\nBut repeated exposures to these chemicals could be moving those without MCS closer to a state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these exposures .\nAnd whether or not one has MCS , it is still a good idea to limit our exposure to these chemicals and pollutants because they can still cause cancer , hormone disruption , and other health effects .\nTo avoid toxic air fresheners , consider removing sources of bad odors , ventilating your living space , using baking soda to absorb odors , and add more air-filtering plants to improve air quality and smell .\nYou can also make your own essential oil sprays .\nWhen exposures can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmful compounds from our body .\nThe goal of Phase 1 of detoxification is to oxidize harmful toxins in the body to break them down and keep them moving through the body \u2019 s detox pathways .\nYou can help activate Phase 1 pathways with foods rich in antioxidants , vitamin C , B vitamins , magnesium , and others .\nPhase 2 detoxification is geared towards moving the broken-down toxins out of the body .\nN-acetyl-cysteine ( NAC ) and glutathione are essential to this process .\nWithout NAC and glutathione , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNAC is a selective immune system enhancer , and , as mentioned above , helps remove free radicals , which contribute to neurogenerative diseases and aging .\nNAC is also a precursor to glutathione , one of the body \u2019 s most important antioxidants .\nGlutathione plays crucial roles in human health , particularly in detoxification .\nUnfortunately , as we \u2019 ve been telling you , the FDA is threatening to ban NAC supplements because the agency claims it was sold as a drug before it was a supplement ; meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into an expensive drug using a new indication .\nThis is outrageous on a number of fronts .\nConsider that NAC is used in hospitals to treat acetaminophen poisoning precisely because it helps detoxify\u2014yet the FDA threatens to remove NAC as a supplement and make it harder for consumers to obtain ?\nFurther , to ban NAC , the FDA would be using a false interpretation of the law .\nThe Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 ( DSHEA ) says that , if an ingredient is investigated as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplement or a \u201c new supplement \u201d notification has been filed , then that substance can not be a supplement .\nBut DSHEA is not supposed to have a retroactive effect ; that is , the law going forward from DSHEA \u2019 s enactment is , if an ingredient is studied as a drug after 1994 , and that ingredient wasn \u2019 t sold as a supplement before studied , it can not be a supplement .\nIt would be unfair and inconsistent with Congressional intent to retroactively apply this provision to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began .\nOtherwise , supplements that were legal before 1994 ( like NAC ) and sold for decades can suddenly and absurdly become illegal .\nWe can not lose access to this critical supplement .\nEvery day we are bombarded with toxins and pollutants from a variety of sources , notably our food , air , water , and consumer products ; we can take some steps , but it is impossible to avoid all of these exposures .\nThreatening to remove a key health product that aids in detoxification to protect drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push back against this callous indifference .\nAction Alert

California , Missouri , and Massachusetts that would severely restrict supplement access show where other states could be heading .\nAction Alert !\nRhode Island state senators Mike McCaffrey , Hanna Gallo , and Joshua Miller recently sought to put ALL supplements behind the counter , and only accessible by retail clerks .\nThis is , by far , the most disastrous state-level supplement bill we at ANH have ever seen .\nThe real concern is that other states could follow Rhode Island \u2019 s example .\nSeveral other states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , MO ) are considering similar legislation for weight-loss supplements , mandating that they be placed behind store counters ; New York just approved one such bill .\nWe must send a strong message to all state legislatures to not even think about pursuing these policies .\nThe hearing on the Rhode Island bill was last week .\nThe good news is that the committee voted to hold the bill for further study , meaning it is not likely to move forward right now .\nThank you to ANH members who sprang to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the mere fact that it was introduced and quickly scheduled for a hearing means that it has a legislative champion who cares about this policy , so it may not be delayed for long .\nIt is hard to imagine a more ridiculous and harmful policy than this bill .\nNot only does the bill mandate that all supplements be accessible only by shop clerks ; it requires that stores post at every purchase counter a warning that dietary supplements are \u201c known to cause gastrointestinal impairment , tachycardia , hypertension , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injury sometimes requiring transplant or leading to death , organ failure , other serious injury , and death.\n\u201d Restricting access to supplements in this way will significantly restrict consumer choice at retail stores .\nThe space available behind store counters is quite limited and already occupied by products like cigarettes .\nThese limitations mean that stores will be forced to carry only products they know will make the most money , if they continue carrying the supplements at all .\nIt also makes it nearly impossible for consumers to compare products and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to check the ingredients to make sure a product doesn \u2019 t have allergens like gluten or other additives , or if you want to make sure a product has the right nutrient form ( like folate vs. folic acid , for example ) , you would be forced to wait in line and then hold up the line to examine the products .\nPutting supplements behind a counter also sends a message that there is something dangerous about them , when the track record of safety for supplements tells a very different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be much harder for consumers to access products that can benefit their health .\nAdditionally , there is a painful irony to the required warning for supplements in the bill : the warning lists a number of health conditions that supplements can actually help treat or prevent !\nWe reported recently on the science supporting magnesium \u2019 s role in heart health and maintaining proper blood pressure .\nWe also know that fish oil supplements lower the risk of heart attack and death from coronary heart disease .\nMicronutrient inadequacies have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illnesses .\nIf this bill passed , you would be warned , at the point of purchase , that supplements can cause heart problems\u2026yet we know that supplements confer heart-protecting benefits .\nHow does this make any sense ?\nFurther , drugs cause side effects far more serious and far more often than supplements : why aren \u2019 t there warnings posted wherever over-the-counter drugs are sold stating they can cause death ?\nUnfortunately , there are concerning signals about where state policies are heading .\nWe haven \u2019 t yet seen a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , for example , just approved a bill that restricts access to weight-loss supplements ; it is waiting to be signed by the Governor .\nSimilar bills are being considered in California , Massachusetts , and Missouri .\nAccording to these bills , the \u201c weight loss \u201d supplements that could be targeted include a broad array of products , including protein powders , hormones , like progesterone and DHEA , glandulars , and lipotropics , which may include essential nutrients like B vitamins and choline .\nSome proponents argue that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c unhealthy weight control behavior , \u201d which are risk factors for eating disorders .\nThis is a noble goal , but the language in these bills casts a wide net that could limit access to products that have nothing to do with weight loss .\nOnce these bills become successful in some states , there is more of a chance that other states will follow suit , so we must act now to prevent further action to enact these policies .\nEfforts like these represent the exact opposite of what we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we \u2019 ve never been sicker , and we pay exorbitant prices for drugs that are dangerous and often ineffective .\nWe should be embracing prevention with natural products that are safe , affordable , and proven to work , but these threaten the profits of Big Pharma and their cronies in government .\nWe must send this clear message to state legislatures across the country as a prophylactic against measures like those considered by Rhode Island .\nAction Alert !\nScroll below to your state government and tell them NOT to restrict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states have done .\nPlease send your message immediately .\nClick your state \u2019 s link to take

of the major and most promising \u2018 new \u2019 frontiers of medicine , despite it often being seen as an anathema to mainstream medics who have yet to gain an understanding of the field .\nChemistry and biochemistry \u2013 the scientific disciplines on which the current , dominant yet failing medical paradigm is based \u2013 just doesn \u2019 t work well enough to mediate

biomedical model can not separate itself from : linear time .\nEven a discipline like nutrition has often been limited by it being viewed under a chemical and biochemical lens .\nWe know , for example , the vital energy ( resonance ) associated with foods that are derived from ecologically-balanced regenerative agricultural systems , and that are delivered to our bodies with care , respect and love , have a profound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with highly processed foods derived from industrial food systems .\nThe frequency at which the molecules in the wholesome foods is higher \u2013 end of .\nSo while we can apportion some of the beneficial effects of wholesome foods to their chemistry , such as their being a better balance of vitamins , minerals and phytonutrients , they literally resonate differently .\nThe article below that Roger has edited is a sneak preview into one branch of quantum medicine .\nWe \u2019 re always very interested in systems of medicine that work well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to be a lesser interplay of placebo or nocebo effects .\nHave a read and see what you think .\nCan I also suggest you separate any concerns you might have over what is currently happening in Ukraine with some of the extraordinary work in the quantum field that has been ongoing over many decades in Russia .\nWave Genetics \u2018 information medicine \u2019 is a treatment system that uses information copied from the quantum state of a healthy human being .\nListening to the resultant sound matrix containing this information enables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal state .\nThe Institute of Linguistics of Wave Genetics invented and is developing \u201c bio-spintronics \u201d technologies that open up wide possibilities in the field of informational medicine .\nThey offer Individual Matrix programs \u2013 as developed by Prof Peter Gariaev \u2013 based on photographs , or umbilical cord blood or placenta , or the bulb of the hair roots .\nUsing their technology , sound recordings are generated within the human audible range .\nThese matrices , remarkably enough , help the body to transform from an unhealthy medical state into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be accessed via an Individualised Matrix based on a youthful , healthy photograph of the subject ( or of a close blood relative ) or the umbilical cord blood and placenta of a new-born baby .\nThe two benefits tend to be an improvement in health , and rejuvenation , i.e.\n, a return to a more youthful state .\nWhile most might want to reverse the aging process as quickly as they can , the process of rejuvenation mediated though \u2018 wave genetics \u2019 comes over time after repeat runs of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the placenta , the cord blood of a new-born or a childhood photo .\nThere is a limit to how fast the process can go , although this phenomenon is not linear , and there are exceptions .\nThe Individual Matrix programs are compiled using the technique developed by Prof Gariaev , and complemented by universal and other programs that utilise the wave ( bio-spin ) information captured from various bioactive substances of natural origin with a long history of use in medicine .\nOne of the many practical results of Linguistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Informational Creams using programming derived from biological substances , prepared in unique ways .\nIndividual Matrix programs ( based on a photo or biological material ) can be used by the donors of these biomaterials , as well as their immediate family .\nFor example , if an Individual Matrix has been generated for a child , it can also be used by the parents , siblings and grandparents which makes an Individual Matrix even more cost-effective .\nPrevention is always better than cure , and what better way to optimise health than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although this is not a replacement for basic good health practices .\nThe methods of Linguistic Wave Genetics have been used to create a new direction in cosmetology ( which strictly means beauty treatments ) \u2013 quantum information cosmetology .\nThanks to these new techniques , the properties of many biologically active substances can be transferred to specially designed creams .\nThis enables the use of ingredients that can not physically be included in the creams because the required physical processing would result in the loss of beneficial properties .\nInformational inclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storage and toxicities that are frequently associated with chemicals used in conventional creams .\nThe quantum healing information included gives a boost to the entire reconstruction and rehabilitation of the skin , which is a vital component of a healthy body .\nThe uniqueness of these \u2018 quantum cosmetics \u2019 is the result of collaboration with academics , technologists , and cosmetologists .\nDuring the process of developing the Linguistic Wave Genetics technology in relation to health correction , many people have reported that their energy levels increased significantly .\nThis has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person \u2019 s more youthful state , using the Individualised Matrix from an earlier photograph .\nOf course we all know that the vast majority who reverse their biological age will also become more energetic .\nIt may also potentially be related to the activation of processes in the body , previously not known .\nThe Institute of Linguistics Wave Genetics is now further researching this area with promising results .\nResearch work also continues to assess whether bio-spin information from unrelated individuals with certain characteristics can be transferred , such as enhanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine should not be considered as a total replacement for other systems of medicine .\nIt is complementary .\nIn general , it is a corrective process that takes commitment and time , although wave genetics practitioners have received plenty of anecdotal positive feedback over fast-acting beneficial responses too .\nWe are all different , and not everybody can or will respond quickly , although everybody will improve over time , provided they honour the process and take care of themselves through appropriate diets and lifestyle choices too .\nPeople should also be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening to either a Universal Matrix , as well as an Individual Matrix , there may be some short-term ( no more than 5 days ) healing adjustment and detoxification , because your body is undergoing changes , in essence , being rebuilt .\nThis is a positive indicator for the long-term benefits , but should you experience such an effect , you should take a break from listening for 1-2 days to give your body a chance to settle down , and then start listening again .\nThe process of obtaining information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly from children is based on quantum physics , specifically laser physics .\nThe theoretical terms and ideas are based on the work of David Bohm , a well-known specialist in the field of plasma physics .\nSignificant contributions to the understanding of human photo-image spectroscopy were made by famous physicist GI Shipov , who developed the theory of torsion ( spin ) fields .\nRelevant ideas from Bohm can be briefly summarized as follows : everything that exists in our world appears in the universal hologram , and this applies to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of us has imprints in the universal hologram , of all our life events from birth to death .\nEach imprint with all its characteristics and with all its genetic information will be stored forever in the hologram .\nIf we can connect to this hologram using a photograph , we can take this complete information about this person at that age .\nThe person can be treated using his/her information from a childhood photograph because in most cases that child was healthy and had not yet struggled with the diseases that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life .\nContributions to overcome the problems of recording quantum information from photographs were made by geneticist , professor Petr Gariaev , leading to a different understanding of our genetic coding in comparison with the more conventionally established and well-known canonical model .\nThe work with photography was preceded by research carried out by Prof Gariaev \u2019 s group on the transfer of genetic information over long distances using a torsion field .\nWhen the possibility of wave transmission of genes over large distances ( measured in kilometres ) was confirmed by experimentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtaining the genetic information using pictures of people .\nA photograph of a person is not just a flat picture copy of that person .\nIt is thought to also contain a lot of quantum information about that person , including information about the person \u2019 s genetics at the time the photograph was taken .\nProf Gariaev was often asked about the validity of information retrieved from images using laser because \u201c the images are only photo emulsions \u201d .\nBut this , proposed Gariaev , is a profound mistake .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image , soaring above the photo .\nThe special laser beam photons , which are used for the retrieval of information , interfere with the photonic image of the person in the photo .\nThe technique is more fully described Gariaev \u2019 s 2015 paper published in DNA Decipher Journal .\nThe most important thing is that the sound range of the photograph acts as a health correction factor , and this is the practical verification of the effectiveness of the spectra .\nListening to your Matrix tends to be more effective first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneficial , although less so got a given time exposure , during the afternoon and evening .\nSometimes , with very painful or severe conditions , the program can be used 24 hours a day in repeat mode .\nMany people listen to their Matrix overnight during sleep whilst the body is naturally doing most healing .\nYou can listen just once through , or loop play to keep listening .\nIf time is an issue to

Government 101 , our U.S. Constitution grants the power of the purse to Congress , so Congress doesn \u2019 t have to follow the President \u2019 s budget proposal .\nHowever , the President \u2019 s budget is important because it shows his Administration \u2019 s policy priorities .\nAnd when the President is of the same party that controls Congress , there is a much greater likelihood that Congress may actually agree with and follow the priorities provided in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s 400 page justification of their budget estimates are a number of insights on the Administration \u2019 s views on some of ANH \u2019 s top priorities .\nAccess to a broad range of safe , affordable dietary supplements is a pillar of our natural health freedom , and the Administration \u2019 s budget makes it clear that they want to clamp down on the U.S. dietary supplement market \u2013 increasing costs and decreasing options for consumers .\nThe FDA \u2019 s budget includes 14 legislative proposals \u201c designed to bolster the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission to protect and promote public health.\n\u201d Included on this relatively short list , \u201c \u2026FDA is seeking to amend DSHEA to : ( 1 ) require annual listing with FDA of individual dietary supplement products , including basic information about each unique product ; and ( 2 ) clarify FDA \u2019 s authorities over products marketed as dietary supplements to facilitate enforcement against unlawfully marketed products .\nThese amendments would allow FDA to know when new products are introduced , quickly identify dangerous or illegal products on the market , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary.\n\u201d One has to wonder , why is the Administration prioritizing this legislative proposal , when clearly the safety issues with other products regulated by the FDA are so much more critical ?\nSupplements are overwhelmingly safe .\nIn this same FDA budget justification document , it states that in FY 2021 , the FDA received 2,400 adverse event reports related to dietary supplements .\nTo put this in context , according to the FDA \u2019 s adverse event database , in 2021 FDA received a total of 2,333,453 adverse event reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up 0.1 % of the adverse event reports to the FDA \u2013 clearly this is not among the top priority issues on which the FDA should focus .\n( I \u2019 m sure you can think of other FDA regulated products where our precious taxpayer dollars could be spent more effectively to protect Americans \u2019 health . )\nAdditionally , the FDA currently has full authority to take action against any supplement products that are improperly manufactured , mislabeled or unsafe .\nAnd the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) already has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dietary supplement product labels .\nThe FDA \u2019 s argument that this mandatory annual supplement listing is a necessary top priority for our public health , and not a ploy to increase supplement costs , create greater barrier to entry for innovative supplement products , and eliminate access to supplement ingredients the FDA believes should be protected for Big Pharma , is ridiculous .\nIn a section on cannabis and other cannabis-derived compounds , the FDA \u2019 s budget justification ignores the elephant in the room that the agency hasn \u2019 t made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplements .\nInstead it includes a lengthy discussion concerning the safety of CBD , along with cannabis and other cannabis-derived compounds .\nThis is in spite of Congress recently telling the FDA it \u201c expects further progress on regulatory pathways for cannabis-derived products that contain cannabidiol.\n\u201d The FDA also responded to the House Appropriations Committee FY 2022 report request that urged \u201c FDA to engage

NASEM ) report on compounded bioidentical hormones \u201c when developing agency policies , while also taking into account various concerns , including patient access concerns.\n\u201d Of course we know that although it may be moving at a glacial government regulatory process pace , the FDA is working to ban access to compounded bioidentical hormones like estriol .\nHomeopathy is nowhere to @ @

although we can \u2019 t read into this too much .\nNow that the President has released his budget proposal , what \u2019 s the next step in the process ?\nThe House and Senate Appropriations

specific equipment from US companies .\nThe equipment wasn \u2019 t appropriate for their type of farming , but these farmers were desperate , and the World Bank couched it as helping lesser developed

success of those in need .\nIndeed , the farmers ended up worse off , saddled with huge debts from the required purchases , and owning machinery they couldn \u2019 t use because inputs like gasoline were out of reach .\nThe thing that stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating to benefit lower income countries in need that instead controlled a process that created wealth for specific , pre-selected companies .\nI didn \u2019 t know at the time what cronyism was , nor did I know that it underlies all politics , abroad and at home , and that it impacts many areas of our lives including our health freedom .\nA few years later I again found myself in the classroom , in law school , and again discussing cronyism .\nThis time the subject was the US Food and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governmental agency responsible for protecting the public health .\nThe subject was drug company liability , or rather the lack thereof , resulting from pharmaceutical industry influence over the FDA regulatory framework that

to do pharma \u2019 s bidding in exchange for cushy jobs when they enter the private sector .\nFor example , in a review published in the BMJ Medical Journal , 27 percent of 55 FDA reviewers responsible for approving hematology-oncology drugs left the FDA to work for the industry they previously regulated .\nThat \u2019 s more than a quarter of those FDA employees !\nThey also make big bucks .\nCurtis Wright , for example , the FDA director who oversaw the approval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year later to work for Purdue Pharma , the manufacturer of OxyContin .\nHe received $ 400,000 in compensation his first year .\nIt gets worse .\nThe FDA receives 45 % of its operating budget directly from drug companies in the form of \u201c user fees \u201d ( used for the approval of new drugs , biologics and devices ) , but 65 % of the funding for human drug regulatory activities are derived from user fees .\nDrug companies might as well be signing the paychecks for those who help bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is guarding the henhouse , yet Congress reauthorizes the program every five years .\nWhy ?\nIn 2020 , drug companies spent $ 314,590,301 lobbying Congress .\nLike the World Bank , the FDA claims it is serving a public good , in this case protecting public health , but creating wealth for private companies appears their priority .\nAfter law school , I worked in environmental , food , and human rights politics , and guess what I encountered in all three ?\nThe same cronyism I had seen with the World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these areas , I noticed that no one was talking about the cronyism .\nThe focus was generally on the issue at hand , like a \u201c bad \u201d drug company that secretly knew its drug was dangerous but continued to sell it anyway .\nThe emphasis was on the actions of the bad actor , the drug company , rather than the regulators that looked the other way , even as scores of adverse events and deaths were reported .\nBut no one asked , how could this have happened in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why does the drug approval process continue to allow dangerous drugs into the market ?\nAnd no one sought to make any changes in the interest of protecting public health .\nFor example , there were 100,000 heart attacks and 55,000 deaths from the drug Vioxx .\nThe FDA did nothing to protect the public , even as the numbers continued to climb .\nFinally , Merck buckled from the pressure and pulled its own drug from the market .\nVioxx may be gone from the market , but the same cronyism that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first instance remains today , and , according to the FDA \u2019 s adverse event database , last year alone there were 2,333,453 injures and 187,750 deaths reported from prescription medications .\nSeveral years after law school , I developed a series of health conditions .\nThis issue of cronyism that had followed and frustrated me for years suddenly became very personal , because I became someone who needed access to natural therapies to heal and to stay

cutting edge therapies they \u2019 ve found clinically beneficial , out of fear that their state medical boards will charge them with practicing outside the \u201c standard of care \u201d , that is ,

\u2019 s note : This article was originally posted in 2014 .\nAt that time , autism prevalence was 16.8 cases per 1,000 children ; the latest data from 2018 show autism prevalence to be 23 cases per 1,000 children , an increase of 37 % since the time the article was published .\nThe incidence rate in 2000 was 6.7 cases per 1,000 , meaning today \u2019 s prevalence rate represents a 243 % increase since that year .\nWhy ?\nEvidence points to glyphosate toxicity from the overuse of Monsanto \u2019 s Roundup herbicide on our food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades , Stephanie Seneff , PhD , has researched biology and technology , over the years publishing over 170 scholarly peer-reviewed articles .\nIn recent years she has concentrated on the relationship between nutrition and health , tackling such topics as Alzheimer \u2019 s , autism , and cardiovascular diseases , as well as the impact of nutritional deficiencies and environmental toxins on human health .\nAt a conference last Thursday , in a special panel discussion about GMOs , she took the audience by surprise when she declared , \u201c At today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in two children will be autistic.\n\u201d She noted that the side effects of autism closely mimic those of glyphosate toxicity , and presented data showing a remarkably consistent correlation between the use of Roundup on crops ( and the creation of Roundup-ready GMO crop seeds ) with rising rates of autism .\nChildren with autism have biomarkers indicative of excessive glyphosate , including zinc and iron deficiency , low serum sulfate , seizures , and mitochondrial disorder .\nA fellow panelist reported that after Dr. Seneff \u2019 s presentation , \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in attendance were squirming , likely because they now had serious misgivings about serving their kids , or themselves , anything with corn or soy , which are nearly all genetically modified and thus tainted with Roundup and its glyphosate.\n\u201d Dr. Seneff noted the ubiquity of glyphosate \u2019 s use .\nBecause it is used on corn and soy , all soft drinks and candies sweetened with corn syrup and all chips and cereals that contain soy fillers have small amounts of glyphosate in them , as do our beef and poultry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corn or soy .\nWheat is often sprayed with Roundup just prior to being harvested , which means that all non-organic bread and wheat products would also be sources of glyphosate toxicity .\nThe amount of glyphosate in each product may not be large , but the cumulative effect ( especially with as much processed food as Americans eat ) could be devastating .\nA recent study shows that pregnant women living near farms where pesticides are applied have a 60 % increased risk of children having an autism spectrum disorder .\nOther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You may recall our story on the CDC whistleblower who revealed the government \u2019 s deliberate concealment of the link between the MMR vaccine ( for measles , mumps , and rubella ) and a sharply increased risk of autism , particularly in African American boys .\nOther studies now show a link between children \u2019 s exposure to pesticides and autism .\nChildren who live in homes with vinyl floors , which can emit phthalate chemicals , are more likely to have autism .\nChildren whose mothers smoked were also twice as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledges that environmental contaminants such as PCBs , PBDEs , and mercury can alter brain neuron functioning even before a child is born .\nThis month , the USDA released a study finding that although there were detectable levels of pesticide residue in more than half of food tested by the agency , 99 % of samples taken were found to be within levels the government deems safe , and 40 % were found to have no detectable trace of pesticides at all .\nThe USDA added , however , that due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not test for residues of glyphosate .\nLet \u2019 s repeat that : they never tested for the active ingredient in the most widely used herbicide in the world .\n\u201c Cost concerns \u201d ?\nHow absurd\u2014unless they mean it will cost them too much in terms of the special relationship between the USDA and Monsanto .\nYou may recall the revolving door between Monsanto and the federal government , with agency officials becoming high-paying executives\u2014and vice versa !\nMoney , power , prestige : it \u2019 s all there .\nMonsanto and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 backs .\nClearly this omission was purposeful .\nIn addition , as we have previously reported , the number of adverse reactions from vaccines can be correlated as well with autism , though Seneff says it doesn \u2019 t correlate quite as closely as with Roundup .\nThe same correlations between applications of glyphosate and autism show up in deaths from senility .\nOf course , autism is a complex problem with many potential causes .\nDr. Seneff \u2019 s data , however , is particularly important considering how close the correlation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientist with impeccable credentials .\nEarlier this year , she spoke at the Autism One conference and presented many of the same facts ; that presentation is available on YouTube .\nMonsanto claims that Roundup is harmless to humans .\nBacteria , fungi , algae , parasites , and plants use a seven-step metabolic route known as the shikimate pathway for the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids ; glyphosate inhibits this pathway , causing the plant to die , which is why it \u2019 s so effective as an herbicide .\nMonsanto says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pathway , so it \u2019 s perfectly safe .\nDr. Seneff points out , however , that our gut bacteria do have this pathway , and that \u2019 s crucial because these bacteria supply our body with crucial amino acids .\nRoundup thus kills beneficial gut bacteria , allowing pathogens to grow ; interferes with the synthesis of amino acids including methionine , which leads to shortages in critical neurotransmitters and folate ; chelates ( removes ) important minerals like iron , cobalt and manganese ; and much more .\nEven worse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are untested because they \u2019 re classified as \u201c inert , \u201d yet according to a 2014 study in BioMed Research International , these chemicals are capable of amplifying the toxic effects of Roundup hundreds of times over .\nGlyphosate is present in unusually high quantities in the breast milk of American mothers , at anywhere from 760 to 1,600 times the allowable limits in European drinking water .\nUrine testing shows Americans have ten times the glyphosate accumulation as Europeans .\n\u201c In my view , the situation is almost beyond repair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presentation .\n\u201c We need to do something drastic .\n\u201d", "author": "ANH-USA", "url":

even search the Internet , and you won \u2019 t find this undeniably simple answer .\nEverywhere you look , conventional medicine is singing the same tune : the Mayo Clinic , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , and the National Institutes of Health all say that even though there is no cure for herpes , the best way to prevent or treat the symptoms is with antiviral medications like acyclovir ( sold under the trade name Zovirax ) , famciclovir ( Famvir ) , or valacyclovir ( Valtrex ) ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for genital herpes .\nThey recommend one of two basic approaches : episodic therapy ( that is , taking the medicine whenever you experience an outbreak ) or suppressive therapy ( taking the medicine daily to minimize the chances of recurrent or future outbreaks ) .\nSuppressive therapy for herpes means huge profits for drug companies , particularly since these medicines are expensive\u2014there is no generic version for Acyclovir as yet , and a one-month supply of Valtrex costs around $ 200 .\nThere is also the small problem that these drugs do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lead to drug-resistant superbugs .\nBut conventional medicine ignores the obvious natural prescription : get a vitamin D test !\nVitamin D is a powerful natural antiviral , which is why we bang the drum about vitamin D therapy for colds and especially flu every chance we get .\nResearch from the University of Copenhagen shows that vitamin D activates the immune system by arming T-cells to fight off infections .\nWithout vitamin D , the immune system \u2019 s T-cells remain dormant , offering little or no protection against invading microorganisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bloodstream , T-cells begin seeking out invaders , which are then destroyed and carried out of the body .\nYou may recall the Japanese study we told you about in June which found that vitamin D was more effective than a vaccine in preventing flu , including pandemic flu .\nThe report , published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition , found that school children taking vitamin D were 58 percent less likely to catch influenza A .\nBy contrast , antiviral drugs such as oseltamivir ( Tamiflu ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infection by only 8 percent .\nEven vaccines had success rates significantly lower than the 58 percent achieved by vitamin D. Our vitamin D\u2013mediated immune response has been with us through more than 60 million years of pre-human and human evolutionary selection , as research from Ohio State demonstrates .\nVitamin D is critical to our survival .\nThe problem is that a whopping 59 percent of the population is deficient in vitamin D , according to research published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism .\nMoreover , nearly 25 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have critically low levels of vitamin D. According to John Cannell , MD , founder of the non-profit Vitamin D Council , \u201c Current research has implicated vitamin D deficiency as a major factor in the pathology of at least seventeen varieties of cancer as well as heart disease , stroke , hypertension , autoimmune diseases , diabetes , depression , chronic pain , osteoarthritis , osteoporosis , muscle weakness , muscle wasting , birth defects , periodontal disease , and more.\n\u201d All of this is in addition to viral and bacterial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sores ) is thought to afflict a majority of the US population , genital herpes perhaps a quarter .\nFor anyone plagued by herpes , and for everyone as we head into flu season , it \u2019 s essential that you are getting enough vitamin D. So please get your vitamin D level checked !\nIf it is less than optimal\u2014levels should be between 40-60 ng/ml , year-round\u2014take a vitamin D supplement ( be sure it \u2019 s

live , or if you sunbathe too early or too late in the day . )\nBesides vitamin D , there are a number of other natural ways to increase the odds of avoiding herpes outbreaks : \u2022 Eliminate sugar and white flour from your diet .\nThey interfere with your immune system \u2019 s ability to fight outbreaks and new infections .\n\u2022 Identify any food allergies or sensitivities , and adopt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( like cashews ) that contain L-arginine , because this amino acid may facilitate outbreaks .\n( This is too bad , because L-arginine may also increase sexual arousal ! )\n\u2022 Take natural vitamins and minerals : lysine ( another amino acid , and a longtime favorite to control herpes ) , vitamin C , selenium ( inhibits the ability of all \u201c herpes-family \u201d viruses to reproduce ) , lithium ( slows down formation of the viral capsid ) , zinc ( boosts the infection-fighting capability of immune system ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for active herpes lesions are vitamin C powder and propolis , a natural product found in beehives .\nThe two can be combined .\nThis is somewhat more realistic than the often-mentioned peppermint oil and tea tree oil , because their pungent odor

had originally not produced any results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in any of these searches is troubling .\nIt is by no means the only measure , but it is an important measure as to how seriously search engines are taking trusted , credible natural health sites .\nIn a search for \u201c natural cold remedies , \u201d most of the searches give you at least one site in the top five results that deals with some natural medicine , but these are from what we might call natural health \u201c lite \u201d sites like healthline.com or verywellhealth.com .\nThey offer some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ginger , vitamin C , and

days .\nWe \u2019 ve pointed out the many issues with internet censorship before , particularly as it applies to issues of natural health .\nWhen Google changed their algorithm for search results to

people against COVID ?\nA huge data dump of documents show , in the words of one journalist , that \u201c natural immunity works and Pfizer knows it.\n\u201d The documents also show that COVID vaccine adverse events are more frequent and more severe in younger age groups .\nYet Pfizer is planning to ask the FDA to authorize a third COVID vaccine shot for healthy kids aged 5-11\u2014and knowing the government , this request will likely be granted , meaning more profits for the vaccine makers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unacceptable .\nNote that this is data neither the government nor Pfizer wanted you to know .\nThe release of hundreds of thousands of pages of documentation from Pfizer \u2019 s Emergency Use Authorization application to the FDA is part of a court order that resulted from a Freedom of Information Act request from Public Health and Medical Professionals for Transparency .\nThe FDA reportedly sought to delay the full release of the documents for 75 years , but the court mandated their release within eight months .\nThe FDA released 11,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporting by The Hill , clinical trial data showed no difference in outcome between those who were vaccinated and those previously infected with COVID .\nNone of the trial participants who were vaccinated or previously infected experienced serious clinical outcomes .\nNatural immunity was also \u201c statistically identical \u201d to vaccination against infection .\nBut rather than tell the truth\u2014that people previously infected do not need the vaccine\u2014Pfizer spun the narrative , concluding that \u201c final efficacy results show that [ the vaccine ] provided protection against COVID-19 in participants with or without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Additionally , the documents reveal that Pfizer was aware that adverse reactions were more frequent and more severe in younger age groups under the age of 55\u2014that is , age groups whose risk of serious COVID is miniscule .\nData from the Lancet shows that 16-year-olds , for example , have a 99.99 percent chance of surviving COVID ; 30-year-olds a 99.94 percent chance ; and 50-year-olds a 99.57 percent chance of surviving .\nThe consent form for trial participants indicates Pfizer was aware of the risk of myocarditis and the possibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproductive health .\nThese revelations throw serious doubt over efforts at the state level to mandate COVID vaccines for school children , especially considering the fact that , according to the CDC , a majority of kids in the US have had COVID .\nSince a majority of kids have had COVID , according to Pfizer \u2019 s own data , they are equally protected as the vaccinated .\nOverall , younger Americans \u2019 risk of death from COVID is nearly zero , yet they experience more severe adverse effects at higher rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this data , not only has the FDA approved the shots for everyone aged five and up , they may approve a third shot for kids .\nThis is absurd and can only be explained by the government doing what it can to safeguard the profits of pharmaceutical companies .\nWe proposed earlier that the end game in recommending the shots for kids is to get COVID vaccines added to the CDC \u2019 s recommended childhood schedule .\nThis perpetuates the protection from liability for the harm the vaccines cause and guarantees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and year out .\nIt

about the vaccine in that no one knows the long-term consequences .\nVaxxinity has planned a Phase 2b trial for late 2022.10 It \u2019 s worth noting that drug development for Alzheimer \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with at least 300 failed trials to date.11 One study , which was a collaboration between Washington University in St. Louis , drug companies Eli Lilly and Roche , the National Institutes of Health and others , involved 194 participants , of which 52 took Roche \u2019 s drug gantenerumab and 52 took Eli Lilly \u2019 s solanezumab.12 The drugs were intended to remove amyloid beta ( A\u03b2 ) from the brain , but they failed to achieve the primary outcome of the study , which was slowed cognitive decline , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn fact , while the drugs did target amyloid beta , they had no effect on cognitive measures , with the researchers writing , \u201c Both drugs engaged their A\u03b2 targets but neither demonstrated a beneficial effect on cognitive measures compared to controls.\n\u201d 13 Even if drugs reduce amyloid beta plaques in Alzheimer \u2019 s patients , how this translates to affecting cognitive decline remains to be seen .\nWhile Alzheimer \u2019 s is characterized by an accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain , there is controversy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disease .\nAs researchers from the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science , department of dementia and higher brain function , wrote in Frontiers in Neuroscience:14 \u201c The so-called amyloid hypothesis , that the accumulation and deposition of oligomeric or fibrillar amyloid \u03b2 ( A\u03b2 ) peptide is the primary cause of Alzheimer \u2019 s disease ( AD ) , has been the mainstream concept underlying AD research for over 20 years .\nHowever , all attempts to develop A\u03b2-targeting drugs to treat AD have ended in failure.\n\u201d In 2009 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oversimplifying Alzheimer \u2019 s disease down to the amyloid-\u03b2 protein precursor ( A\u03b2PP ) molecule , \u201c implying that this molecule encapsulates AD so completely that the disease itself is almost of secondary importance.\n\u201d This , they noted , ignores \u201c the complexity of chronic diseases in general \u201d and added:15 \u201c A great deal of attention has focused on amyloid-\u03b2 as the major pathogenic mechanisms with the ultimate goal of using amyloid-\u03b2 lowering therapies as an avenue of treatment .\nUnfortunately , nearly a quarter century later , no tangible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure tends to be the most compelling .\nWe have long contended , as has substantial literature , that proteinaceous accumulations are simply downstream and , often , endstage manifestations of disease .\nTheir overall poor correlation with the level of dementia , and their presence in the cognitively intact is evidence that is often ignored as an inconvenient truth .\nCurrent research examining amyloid oligomers , therefore , will add copious details to what is , in essence , a reductionist distraction from upstream pleiotrophic processes such as oxidative stress , cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now long overdue that the neuroscientists avoid the pitfall of perseverating on \u2018 proteinopathies \u2019 and recognize that the continued targeting of end stage lesions in the face of repeated failure , or worse , is a losing proposition.\n\u201d There is even research to suggest that advanced protein aggregation , such as that seen in Alzheimer \u2019 s disease , could offer protective functions , perhaps protecting cells from toxic intermediates.16 Writing in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences , researchers suggested that amyloid beta is a response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a protective adaptation to the disease.17 Amyloid beta , they argued , accumulates relatively late in the development of Alzheimer \u2019 s disease , and while it has been found to be toxic in cell culture models , this may not hold true in humans .\nInstead of the prevailing notion that a mutation leads to increased amyloid beta and that leads to Alzheimer \u2019 s , the team suggested that a mutation leads to Alzheimer \u2019 s , which in turn triggers increased amyloid beta:18 \u201c Mutations lead to cellular stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to increased amyloid-\u03b2 \u2026 in AD , cellular stress precedes increases in amyloid-\u03b2 \u2026 Proteins , such as amyloid-\u03b2 , that are induced under oxidative conditions and act to lessen oxidative damage are typically thought of as antioxidants and , in this regard , we recently demonstrated that amyloid-\u03b2 is a bona fide antioxidant that can act as a potent superoxide dismutase.\n\u201d This would explain , they suggest , why the brains of most elderly people contain amyloid-\u03b2 , often in amounts similar to those found in patients with Alzheimer \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c While such production and deposition of amyloid-\u03b2 appears to successfully stave off age-related redox imbalances in normal aging , in AD , where there is a profound and chronic redox imbalance , the presence of amyloid-\u03b2 , even at high levels , proves insufficient.\n\u201d The Link Between Alzheimer \u2019 s and Your Gut If Alzheimer \u2019 s pathogenesis can not be blamed entirely on amyloid beta , what , then , is the cause ?\nIt \u2019 s likely that many factors are to blame , with imbalances in gut microbiota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , that the bacteria in your intestines may influence brain functioning and can even promote neurodegeneration.20 In a study of 89 people , high blood levels of lipopolysaccharides ( LPSs ) and the short-chain fatty acids ( SCFAs ) acetate and valerate were associated with large amyloid deposits in the brain.21 LPSs and SCFAs are markers of inflammation and proteins produced by intestinal bacteria .\nHigh levels of butyrate \u2014 an SCFA produced when gut bacteria ferment fiber \u2014were associated with less amyloid .\nThe study represents a continuation of prior research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gut microbiota in people with Alzheimer \u2019 s disease differs from those without the condition ; in those with Alzheimer \u2019 s , microbial diversity is reduced , with certain bacteria being overrepresented and other microbes decreased.22 \u201c Our results are indisputable : certain bacterial products of the intestinal microbiota are correlated with the quantity of amyloid plaques in the brain , \u201d explains Moira Marizzoni , a study author with the Fatebenefratelli Center in Brescia , Italy.23 Still other research suggests gut microbiota may contribute to Alzheimer \u2019 s risk via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , diabetes , sleep and circadian rhythm.24 It \u2019 s also possible , researchers hypothesize , that decades of factors such as diet , stress , aging and genetics , combine to disrupt gut permeability and the integrity of the blood-brain barrier , allowing the entry of inflammatory agents and pathogens and inducing an inflammatory response that triggers a neuroinflammatory response in the brain.25 There \u2019 s More to Alzheimer \u2019 s Than Amyloid Beta UB-311 \u2014 the fast-tracked Alzheimer \u2019 s vaccine \u2014 is not going to touch the many complex factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s disease and is likely to have unintended adverse consequences .\nDietary factors , for instance , are

us protect access .\nAction Alert !\nFor the last few weeks , we \u2019 ve been telling you about the threat to compounded glutathione , one of the most important substances made by the human body .\nGlutathione helps with many ailments , but one of its most important functions is in detoxification\u2014removing harmful foreign compounds from the body .\nGiven the deluge of unregulated toxic chemicals we are exposed to in the modern world , our ability to detoxify to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWe must protect access to compounded glutathione .\nWhy detoxify in the first place ?\nOn one end of the spectrum , you may not have a disease , but simply don \u2019 t feel well .\nYou may have low energy , brain fog , achy joints , gas , or any number of symptoms .\nDetoxifying can be a solution .\nDetoxification can also be part of treating or preventing disease .\nEmerging research is showing that chronic disease is caused by exposure to toxins in the environment , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metals , pesticides , BPA , and others .\nJoseph Pizzorno , ND has estimated that as much as 90 percent of the diabetes epidemic is due to exposure to environmental toxins .\nThese toxins can also play a role in autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis .\nDr. Pizzorno estimates , for example , that 20 percent of asthma cases are caused by mold ; that number jumps to 67 percent if the asthma is adult-onset .\nPreventing the accumulation of these toxins by regular detoxification could be one way to stave off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nGlutathione is key to Phase II detoxification , which is geared towards moving toxins out of the body .\nWithout glutathione the body can not remove these harmful toxins .\nGlutathione is directly responsible for transporting mercury out of cells and the brain .\nGlutathione also deals directly with the causes of oxidative stress by neutralizing free radicals and removing persistent organic pollutants .\nIn some cases , glutathione does this by helping to make toxins water soluble so they can be flushed from the body in urine .\nLow levels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemical toxins .\nGiven the roles glutathione plays in the body , it isn \u2019 t hard to imagine why it is used widely to help patients detoxify .\nThis is usually done through intravenous , intranasal , or topical administration , as oral glutathione is not likely to increase intracellular glutathione levels .\nThese useful forms are all made at compounding pharmacies\u2014and they are all being threatened by an FDA ban , as we \u2019 ve been explaining in recent articles .\nAnother way to increase glutathione in the body is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precursor to glutathione .\nUnfortunately , the FDA is on record saying that NAC is not a legal supplement because it was approved as a drug before it was sold as a supplement\u2014though the agency has also stated it is considering initiating a rulemaking to allow NAC supplements .\nOur recent coverage also underscores the pressing need for all of us to detoxify .\nOf course , the best option is to avoid toxic exposures to reduce the need to detoxify , but that simply isn \u2019 t an option for most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health Institute found that , in 2019 , chemical exposures resulted in the death of 2 million people globally and the loss of 53 million disability adjusted life-years .\nOf the 84,000 chemicals currently on the market , the EPA has banned or restricted only a handful of chemicals since 1976 .\nPoint being , we need to be able to detoxify our bodies , and the FDA is seriously compromising our

shootings in Buffalo , NY and Uvalde , Texas have tragically brought the issue of gun violence back to the nation \u2019 s attention .\nThese violent incidents spark heated debates about what can be done to stem the tide of these attacks .\nOne potential factor that is often overlooked in these debates is the role that powerful , mind-altering pharmaceutical drugs could be playing in this epidemic of violence .\nBefore moving on , we feel it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that our aim is not to stigmatize those suffering from mental health , or to suggest they are dangerous .\nMany people are suffering from mental health struggles , and our health system is geared towards prescribing very powerful drugs to these patients that have very serious side effects .\nIn some cases these drugs may be necessary , but in other cases evidence-backed natural medicines are ignored and underutilized .\nIn many of the violent attacks that have occurred over the years , the individuals responsible were diagnosed and treated for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mental health of the Buffalo and Uvalde suspects are unknown at this point ; we do know that the Buffalo suspect had undergone a mental health evaluation after making a school shooting threat .\nA few years ago , ANH-USA researched dozens of the most high-profile cases of violent crimes over the last few decades .\nWe found that in just under half of the cases ( eleven out of twenty-three ) , the perpetrator was documented to be taking , or had recently stopped taking , some form of antidepressant or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the killer had been on these medications earlier .\nWe suspect that number is even higher , but the information is either not publicly available or not known .\nOther publications support these findings .\nMother Jones looked at all mass shootings from 1982 through 2015\u2014seventy-two incidents altogether .\nOf these , more than half of the perpetrators ( forty-three ) had shown signs of mental illness prior to the crime .\nGiven the propensity of conventional doctors to prescribe antidepressants and other antipsychotic drugs ( more on this below ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leap to assume that many of these perpetrators were taking medications .\nThe FDA recognizes this , and many antidepressants carry \u201c black box warnings , \u201d the most stringent precaution a drug label can carry before being removed from the market .\nMany antidepressants carry a black box warning of an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior .\nDr. Robert Whitaker notes that there is also a shocking risk of increased violence to others , which is not highlighted in the black box .\nImportant research has shown major drugs like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence at a substantially higher rate than other drugs\u2014users of Paxil are 10.3 times more likely to do violence to themselves or others , while users of Prozac are 10.9 times more likely to commit acts of violence .\nOther evidence shows that people who have exhibited no propensity for violence or aggression can develop violent behavior soon after beginning antidepressants .\n( You can find still more evidence of the link between antidepressants and violence in our previous coverage of the topic . )\nThe FDA relies on studies conducted by major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reliable .\nEven if the data is pristine , the interpretation will almost certainly be skewed in favor of the drug .\nConsider the case of Paxil .\nFourteen years ago , the manufacturer , GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) , published a study which was interpreted to mean that Paxil was safe and effective for teens .\nAn analysis of that same data , published in 2015 in the prestigious British Medical Journal , found the exact opposite to be true\u2014that teenagers on Paxil did no better than a placebo on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seriously downplayed the drug \u2019 s dangerous side effects !\nThis reinterpretation was only possible because GSK , to its credit , allowed the data to become public .\nIt should be noted , however , that this was only done once the patent had gotten older and was thus less valuable .\nSuicide and violence are just two side effects of antidepressants .\nThere have been a total 134 warnings from regulatory agencies in eleven countries including : \u2022 21 warnings that they cause birth defects \u2022 6 warnings that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause mania or psychosis \u2022 4 warnings that they cause death \u2022 4 warnings that they cause hallucinations or delusional thinking \u2022 4 warnings that they cause involuntary movements \u2022 2 warnings that they cause sexual dysfunction There is a great deal we don \u2019 t know , partly because so much of drug companies \u2019 research on these drugs is kept secret .\nBut the correlation between violent crime and the use of these legal , mind-altering prescription drugs is too strong to be ignored , while scientific evidence of the connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t the FDA done anything ?\nThe answer should be clear enough .\nAntidepressants are some of the most prescribed drugs in the US .\nAbout 10 % of Americans\u201430 million people\u2014are on antidepressants , which includes 25 % of women in their 40s and 50s .\nAntidepressant use has increased an astounding 400 % in recent years .\nThis translates into billions of dollars in profits worldwide for the pharmaceutical industry .\nAnd drug company money represents a 45 percent of the FDA \u2019 s operating budget and 65 % of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhat is especially tragic about the wide use of antidepressants and their connection to violence and other terrible side effects is the fact that there are far safer , natural alternatives .\nWe \u2019 ve reported before about some of these .\nSometimes depression is triggered by a life event or series of events .\nBut what conventional medicine generally fails to notice is the connection between the brain and the body\u2014how the body , and especially the gut , can have a profound effect on the brain , and vice versa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a simple nutrient that is missing .\nIt is often B vitamins , or it may be a mineral such as magnesium .\nAn integrative approach to medicine also addresses the imbalances in the body that may cause our mood to be out of whack .\nConsider that 95 % of the body \u2019 s serotonin , the chemical that most depression drugs try to increase , is found in the gut .\nThe standard American diet does not optimize either serotonin or gut health , leading to leaky gut syndrome and sustained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gut dysbiosis and leaky gut because they destroy the good bacteria lining the intestines , allowing pathogenic bacteria to colonize .\nWhen the lining of the digestive system becomes permeable , toxic substances and bacteria leak into the bloodstream , triggering food sensitivities , inflammation , and autoimmune problems .\nAdditionally , hormone imbalances caused by hypothyroidism , which often goes undiagnosed , may cause mental health problems .\nMany people taking antidepressant medications , then , should really be addressing the underlying thyroid issue .\nTo find an integrative doctor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prescribe Prozac but will address the root cause , click here for some helpful links .\nThis is a life-or-death issue .\nHow many more violent crimes will we have to endure before something is done about SSRIs and other mental health medications ?\nWe owe it to our kids to do more than recite the same clich\u00e9s every time we are confronted with a new horror .\nIn 2011 , ANH submitted a Citizen Petition to the FDA asking the FDA to expand the current black box warning on antidepressants to include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , in addition to the current suicide warning

costing as much as three times more .\nAre these supplements worth the extra cost ?\nDo they deliver more potent vitamin punches , or is it all hype ?\nLiposomal vitamins are vitamins encapsulated in a sphere of phospholipids , the same material that make up cell membranes .\nLiposomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms of fat .\nThe idea is that , because liposomal vitamins are made of the same material as cell membranes , the vitamin can easily bond with cells and is better absorbed .\nThe phospholipid sphere protects the enclosed nutrient from getting degraded in the digestive tract , meaning liposomal delivery could benefit those with digestive issues who do not absorb nutrients as readily as others .\nGiven that high-dose vitamin C can cause digestive discomfort and diarrhea , liposomal vitamins could be an attractive option for those who want to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those side effects .\nAdditionally , by essentially bypassing the digestive system , more efficient delivery can be achieved , meaning a lower dose of the nutrient in liposomal form could be equivalent to a much higher dose of a conventional supplement in tablet or capsule form .\nLiposomal delivery is especially advantageous for certain nutrients that are generally not absorbed well and have low bioavailability , like vitamin C , glutathione , and curcumin .\nThese are the purported benefits of liposomal products ; but what do the studies say ?\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In one study of 11 men and women , researchers found that 4 grams of vitamin C delivered liposomally produced higher circulating concentrations of vitamin

study found that white blood cells absorbed 50 percent more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a non-liposomal product .\nAnother study found that liposomal vitamin A was more useful than oral forms for delivering vitamin

mandatory product listing ( MPL ) for supplements , a policy championed by Senator Dick Durbin ( D-IL ) .\nWe fear that , if MPL gets passed , the US will start restricting vitamin doses as has been going on in Europe for some time now .\nThese restrictions are based on unscientific assessments of the risk posed by supplement doses .\nThe main thing wrong with these determinations is that they overstate the danger posed by supplements and completely ignore the health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doses .\nTaking even one step in this direction threatens your access to a variety of supplements at levels that can support and optimize health .\nHere \u2019 s what has been going on in Europe .\nEuropean regulators , using models derived from the US National Academies , developed \u201c tolerable upper limits \u201d ( ULs ) for a variety of nutrients .\nThese are levels above which regulators believe adverse events can occur .\nULs are then used to develop legally-enforceable \u201c maximum permitted levels \u201d of nutrients in supplements .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe maximum levels for supplements can happen here : US authorities are the original architects of ULs ; Europe simply took this approach and ran with it .\nOur recent look at what Sweden has been doing serves as just one example of the restrictions being proposed across the European Union .\nMPL for supplements makes it much easier for US regulators to pursue similar restrictions here .\nThe plan started in the mid 1990s when ULs for nutrients were first developed in the US , and Sen. Durbin has been working ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANH-International has been at the forefront of this issue since the beginning .\nANH-International founder , Robert Verkerk , PhD , has published several papers critiquing the approach that has been used to determine the ULs for nutrients .\nIn these papers , Dr. Verkerk points to a fundamental flaw : in setting upper limits for vitamins , regulators have completely ignored the fact that , for most people , risk overlaps with many health benefits that can be derived from nutrient doses above upper limits .\nThink of it this way : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply a methodology intended to eliminate any risk of adverse events from vitamins and minerals from supplements in the vast majority ( > 97 percent ) of the population .\nIf a similar approach was applied to food , all wheat and dairy products would be banned , since gluten sensitivity exists in 12 percent of the population and 36 percent of the US population is lactose intolerant .\nTake niacin , for example .\nThe UL for niacin was determined using the lowest intakes that induce flushing , the redness caused when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skin\u2014even though the flushing effect varies in intensity between individuals , habitual use of niacin may eliminate it , and at least one form of niacin , inositol hexanicotinate , does not cause flushing .\nEU authorities set the UL for niacin at 10 mg/day , while US authorities set the UL at 35 mg/day .\nHowever , most health benefits of taking niacin supplements\u2014for blood lipid management , improved blood glucose control , and management of anxiety\u2014occur well above these dosages .\nTo take one example , studies have found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 33 percent at 2 grams per day , though vasodilation and flushing affects can occur more at these higher doses .\nEuropean countries are setting limits on how much niacin supplements can deliver in order to protect a certain subset of consumers from flushing effects , while ignoring any benefit that can be derived from taking higher amounts of that nutrient .\nWe have to ask ourselves , are rashes and skin-reddening serious enough to limit consumer choices ?\nAre they more serious than cholesterol management ?\nThis makes no sense , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always tried to erect roadblocks to prevent consumers from using supplements for therapeutic purposes .\nIn the government \u2019 s view , only drugs can prevent or treat disease ; admitting higher doses of certain nutrients can impart health benefits threatens Big Pharma profits .\nVitamin D is another example .\nEuropean regulators set the UL for vitamin D at 50 micrograms ( 2,000 IU ) ; Germany then set a maximum permitted level of 20 micrograms ( 800 IU ) of vitamin D in supplements .\nThe UL determined by the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or 4,000 IU .\nThis prevents individuals from consuming higher levels of vitamin D which , in the absence of significant exposure to the sun , has been associated with reduced cancer risk and lower incidence of cardiovascular disease .\nAs we reported previously , achieving what integrative experts consider optimal vitamin D levels can require individuals to take between 5,000-8,000 IU ( 125-200 micrograms ) vitamin D per day .\nWe \u2019 ve previously discussed the failing of regulators to take into account the differing effects of various molecular forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , the upper limit on magnesium was set based on the propensity of magnesium oxide to cause diarrhea .\nBut the forms used commonly by integrative medicine practitioners ( glycinate , taurate , malate , or chloride ) are much gentler on the gut .\nYet restrictions on magnesium supplements apply equally to all forms across the board .\nThe same ineptitude is apparent in restrictions placed on all forms of vitamin B6 when only one form , the pyridoxine form , is associated with negative effects at extremely high doses .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear that regulators in the European Union and the US don \u2019 t have a clue what they are doing .\nThese are the people Sen.

"alliancefornaturalhealth", "title": "Lowering Blood Pressure Naturally", "content": "As a key contributor to the leading cause of death among adults , getting blood pressure under control is of critical importance\u2014here are some natural ways to do so .\nLet this sink in : high blood pressure is the single most important risk factor for dying prematurely , and 90 percent of Americans are predicted to develop it by the age of 65 .\nNearly half of adults currently have hypertension , but only 24 percent have their condition under control .\nIt should come as no surprise that 4 of the top 10 prescribed drugs in the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle on your blood pressure is incredibly important to overall health and well-being .\nThe good news is that , for many people , drugs are not necessary , and getting blood pressure under control can be achieved through diet and lifestyle modifications , along with some key supplements .\nBlood pressure is the pressure of blood pushing against the walls of your arteries , which carry blood from your heart to other parts of the body .\nIt is the measure of systolic pressure ( maximum pressure during one heartbeat ) over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nNormal , healthy blood pressure is considered anything at or less than 120 mm Hg systolic ( the upper number on the blood pressure monitor ) and 80 diastolic ; 120-129 mm Hg is considered \u201c elevated \u201d ; 130-139 mm Hg systolic and 80-89 diastolic is stage 1 hypertension , and anything over 140 mm Hg systolic and 90 diastolic is stage 2 hypertension .\nIn 2017 , the threshold for high blood pressure was lowered from 140 mm Hg to 130 mm Hg , meaning millions more Americans were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For most people with hypertension in the conventional medical system , that means taking at least one blood pressure-lowering medication .\nNo doubt , then , that Big Pharma was salivating when the threshold for high blood pressure was lowered , as it would deliver them millions of new customers .\nIt may be that some people do need a medication to help lower their blood pressure , but diet and lifestyle modifications can also help many people lower their blood pressure to healthy levels .\nConsider that high blood pressure affects only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional diet , but its prevalence increases when these cultures move towards a Western-style diet ( processed foods , sedentary behavior , excess sugar , etc. )\n.\nClearly , diet and lifestyle have a lot to do with blood pressure .\nIn fact , the authors of the major study that was the impetus for lowering the threshold for high blood pressure ( the SPRINT trial ) suggest that patients newly diagnosed with hypertension who fall between 120-129 mm Hg should start with diet and lifestyle changes .\nThe problem is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears , as our medical system is not geared towards guiding patients through such changes .\nDoctors may pay lip service to these concepts , but more often than not , patients will return a few weeks later with blood pressure unchanged , at which point the doctor will prescribe blood pressure-lowering medications .\nThe problem with using medications to lower blood pressure is that they do not address the root causes of high blood pressure : a sedentary lifestyle , stress , too much alcohol , smoking , poor diet , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These medications also come with a host of side effects .\nDepending on the medication , they can cause gout , insomnia , erectile dysfunction , asthma symptoms , hacking cough , loss of taste , dizziness , constipation , dizziness , headaches , and more .\nFurther , a meta-analysis from the Cochrane Collaboration concluded that treating mild hypertension ( 140-159/90-99 ) with blood pressure-lowering medications did not reduce coronary heart disease , stroke , or total cardiovascular events .\nThe whole point of lowering blood pressure is to avoid these outcomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have blood pressure exceeding 120/80 mm Hg , diet and lifestyle changes along with targeted supplementation should be the first course of action .\nThere seems to be broad agreement among integrative experts about the core components of this approach .\nDiet is key , particularly a Mediterranean-type diet or Paleo diet .\nPaleo diets have been found to be effective in reducing blood pressure .\nThe Mediterranean diet has also been shown to have beneficial effects on blood pressure and heart health , particularly in older adults .\nThe Ornish diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart disease .\nThis is a low-fat , plant-based diet filled with fruits , vegetables , whole grains , and legumes .\nA 2014 meta-analysis published in JAMA 2014 shows that vegetarian diets such as this are associated with lower blood pressure .\nThe DASH ( Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension ) diet is often recommended .\nA 2016 meta-analysis found that diets such as the DASH , Nordic , and Mediterranean diets lowered blood pressure by 4.26 mm HG/ 2.35 mm HG .\nThese diets are all characterized by high intakes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legumes , seeds , nuts , fish , and dairy .\nBoth high fat ( Paleo ) and low fat ( Ornish , DASH ) diets have evidence behind them to lower blood pressure .\nOne potential issue with the lower-fat diets discussed here is that the lower fat content can mean less satiety , which can drive over-indulgence in carb-rich foods that are allowed by those diets ( breads , potatoes , etc . )\npromoting insulin-resistance , weight gain , and increases in blood pressure .\nA commonality in these diets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh vegetables and some fruits .\nCertain foods that promote high blood pressure should be avoided : caffeine , refined carbs , and sugars .\nSalt is often mentioned alongside these other foods , but mounting evidence has shown that universal salt restriction guidelines are incorrect ; the story is more complicated .\nLowering salt intake may be appropriate for some \u201c salt sensitive \u201d individuals , however .\nOther diet and lifestyle changes for lowering blood pressure include : \u2022 Caloric restriction .\nStudies have demonstrated that caloric restriction can help address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe usual method is to reduce caloric intake by 10-30 percent of normal energy consumption .\n\u2022 Intermittent fasting .\nEating little or nothing on certain days of the week or eating only during certain hours of the day has many health benefits , including for lowering blood pressure .\n\u2022 Increased potassium intake .\nHigher intakes of potassium , as observed in many hunter-gatherer societies , is associated with lower blood pressure .\nFoods high in potassium include bananas , oranges , cooked spinach , cooked broccoli , sweet potatoes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leafy greens .\n\u2022 Weight loss .\nLosing weight is known to lower blood pressure .\n\u2022 Exercise .\nRegular exercise has been associated with average reductions in blood pressure of 3.2-3.8 systolic .\nA sedentary lifestyle is associated with multiple cardiovascular risk factors , including higher blood pressure , unhealthy weight gain , increased cholesterol levels , and impaired glucose metabolism .\nRegular physical activity makes your heart stronger .\nA stronger heart can pump more blood with less effort , so the force on your arteries decreases , lowering your blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time can also raise blood pressure , so try to break up these periods with some form of physical activity .\n\u2022 Limited alcohol intake .\nHigh alcohol consumption is associated with hypertension .\nMore than two drinks a day for men and one drink a day for women was associated with higher blood pressure .\n\u2022 Reduced use of Acetaminophen and NSAIDs .\nThese and other over-the-counter medications are known to drive up blood pressure ; antacids high in sodium , weight-loss stimulants , and caffeine pills also contribute to high blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tai Chi , meditation , and yoga into your life have all been linked to lower blood pressure .\nThis likely has something to do with managing stress .\nWhen under stress , the body produces hormones like adrenaline that make your heart beat faster and your blood vessels narrow\u2014this is the fight or flight response .\nNarrower blood vessels can lead to high blood pressure .\nStrategies to reduce or manage stress , then , help lower blood pressure .\nThese changes are best paired with targeted supplements to reduce blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consult for lists of these supplements , but some of the common ones include : \u2022 Fish oil reduces oxidative stress and inflammation , normalizes blood vessel function , and inhibits the formation of blood clots and atherosclerosis .\n\u2022 Olive polyphenols are among the main reasons the Mediterranean diet is heart-protective .\nA study showed polyphenol-rich olive oil lowered blood pressure compared to a control intervention of refined olive oil .\nAlso important to note is that high blood pressure is more prevalent among black adults than white adults ; researchers speculate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day-to-day experience of racial discrimination .\nSome people may not be able to lower their blood pressure to optimal ranges using the above-mentioned strategies , in which case medications may be called for .\nThe best regimen to use here is best determined in consultation with an integrative doctor .\nOne important note is for diabetic patients : evidence from a large clinical trial has indicated that intensive drug treatment to lower blood pressure below 120 mm Hg did not lead to fewer cardiovascular events .\nFurther , a 2016 meta-analysis found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood pressure under 140 mm Hg led to increased risk of cardiovascular death .\nThere is another caveat to the general advice given above .\nOlder patients with pre-existing vascular disease and other medical problems often require higher blood pressure to allow blood to reach critical organs in the body .\nWe hope this has provided a useful introduction to the ways that blood pressure can be managed with natural medicines in addition to diet and lifestyle changes .\nAs always , you should consult with your ( preferably integrative ) doctor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for you based on your individual needs .", "author": "ANH-USA", "url":

medicine \u201c snake oil \u201d and \u201c quackery \u201d for years .\nThe essence of this argument is that there isn \u2019 t any evidence that natural medicines are effective at preventing or treating illness .\nDistilled even further , the argument is that there isn \u2019 t enough of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c gold standard \u201d : randomized , placebo-controlled trials ( RCTs ) .\nThe argument is true in a specific sense : there are indeed major structural barriers to conducting this kind of research on non-patentable natural therapies because , unlike the case with drugs , the huge cost of this research can not be recouped .\nMore fundamentally , RCTs may be inappropriate to determine the effectiveness of vitamins and minerals because the effects are harder to isolate .\nThe mainstream \u2019 s insistence on RCTs also ignores the mountains of clinical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural medicine \u2019 s effectiveness .\nAll of this serves to keep natural medicine out of the standard of care , and to keep us , as a nation , hooked on prescription drugs .\nOne major barrier to studying nutrients and their effects on disease through RCTs is lack of funding .\nWithin the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) is the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health ( NCCIH ) .\nOut of NIH \u2019 s $ 43 billion budget in 2021 , NCCIH received a whopping $ 154 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other countries .\nFor example , about 0.08 percent of the British National Health Service \u2019 s research budget went to integrative medicine .\nRCTs cost an average of $ 600 million , and often much more .\nClinical trials of integrative medicine can be even more expensive because effect sizes are often small , which requires large sample sizes , and therapeutic effects may appear only after long treatment periods\u2014both of which add to the cost of conducting RCTs .\nThis brings us to a fundamental problem .\nBecause nutrients ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be patented , there isn \u2019 t a way for a commercial interest to recoup the astronomical costs of conducting RCTs .\nOnly pharmaceutical companies making drugs , which can be strongly patented , can afford theses costs .\nThis creates a vicious cycle : natural therapies are shut out of medical care because conventional \u201c experts \u201d claim there isn \u2019 t high-caliber evidence to support their effectiveness ; drug companies can afford this research , and so become accepted as the \u201c standard of care \u201d for disease treatment .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ that drugs are still often quite ineffective and very dangerous , whereas supplements are both effective and extremely safe .\nIt should also be noted that RCTs are often inappropriate for studying food and nutrients .\nA new-to-nature drug molecule can be better isolated in its effects , although interactions with other drugs are inadequately studied .\nFoods and supplements often depend on co-factors .\nFor example , supplemental calcium should not be taken without supplemental K2 , D , and magnesium ( especially the K2 ) , but isolating it for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider trying to study something like probiotics in an RCT .\nProbiotics interact with a person \u2019 s gut microbiome\u2014the ecosystem of microorganisms residing in the intestinal tract\u2014in infinitely complex ways .\nFurther , the makeup of individuals \u2019 gut microbiomes is highly variable , depending on one \u2019 s diet , environmental exposures , and other factors .\nGiven the complexity of these factors , trying to isolate the specific impact of probiotics on health in an RCT may be extremely difficult .\nHere \u2019 s another example .\nRCTs rely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is easier to achieve in drug trials , since drugs are manufactured products\u2014one Lipitor pill will be identical to another Lipitor pill .\nThis is different for supplements .\nStudies on curcumin have shown that the addition of just 1 percent by weight of piperine can result in a 2,000 percent increase in curcumin \u2019 s bioavailability .\nEven tiny changes in product composition that are within manufacturing quality standards may yield very different effects .\nFor herbal medicines , potency may vary based on variety , cultivation method , place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally , the very nature of natural therapies is somewhat incompatible with standard approaches to research .\nThe cornerstone of integrative medicine is that treatment is highly individualized and holistic , addressing root causes of health problems .\nThis approach is inherently difficult to study in RCTs , which often require isolating a single variable and determining its effectiveness alone .\nThere is also a heavy dose of hypocrisy in the criticism that natural medicine is not backed by strong evidence .\nA few years ago , ProPublica published a report detailing how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and medical procedures long after their appropriateness has been contradicted by research .\nHeart stents are a prime example .\nStents are small metal mesh tubes that are used to prop open an artery .\nEvery year , more than 500,000 Americans undergo this procedure , called an angioplasty , but many patients\u2014especially those with stable coronary artery disease\u2014see little or no benefit .\nDespite all of these barriers and hostility from the defenders of the status quo , there has been a lot of quality research done on natural medicines .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeanne Drisko , MD , who spent years studying the therapeutic effects of intravenous vitamin C , chelation therapy , and many others .\nANH \u2019 s Pulse of Natural Health newsletter has strived over the years to report on the important and impressive research demonstrating the therapeutic effects of humble vitamins and minerals\u2014and we will continue to do so .\nThe status quo that keeps us hooked on pharmaceutical drugs that treat the symptoms of preventable chronic illnesses must change .\nThe proof of the failure of this paradigm is all around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we demand that more money is made available for research on natural health modalities .\nAction Alert !\nWrite to Congress and urge them to force NIH to divert more money to support research on natural health modalities .\nPlease send your message immediately .", "author": "ANH-USA", "url":

beginning of our Healing from the Ground Up series .\nThis series will take you on a journey demonstrating how to use natural health to unlock your full health potential .\nWe will dissect the various building blocks of health , starting with the fundamental determinants of health like genetics , environment , and diet .\nYou can read more about why we \u2019 ve put this series together in our introductory article .\nToday , we start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and epigenetics , the study of how genes are turned on and off .\nResearchers are learning more and more about the connection between human health and genetics .\nThis has led to an explosion in the genetic testing market , which is expected to double by 2030 .\nOur genetics form the basis for our health .\n99.9 percent of our genomes are identical ; the last 0.1 percent is where variations occur between humans and defines why and how we differ from each other .\nThese gene variations are like spelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often known as single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) .\nWe often think of our genes as our destiny : you get genes from your mother and genes from your father , and that \u2019 s that .\nEmerging research is showing that predisposition is not predestiny , and the choices we make in our lifestyle , diet , and our environment changes how our genes are expressed , turning the genes on or off .\nThese gene variations influence how we respond to the world around us , to our diet ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diets , etc ) , how we consume and burn up calories , our response to exercise and injury , and how we respond to stress and trauma .\nOur gene variations also impact how we metabolize pollutants , hormones and drugs .\nUnderstanding your genes is the first step to optimizing your health .\nHere \u2019 s one sample genetic test from 3X4 Genetics , one of the more user-friendly reports on the market today .\nThe report is broken down into the six categories ( listed below ) covering 36 areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the breadth of information that can be gleaned from learning about your SNPs and how they work together : \u2022 Cellular .\nYour genetic makeup can give you information on how well you methylate , keep inflammation at bay , handle oxidative stress , and how well you detoxify .\n\u2022 Systems .\nSNPs offer insights into your mood and behavior changes , as well as how to improve your memory , brain health , bone health , and hormonal balance .\n\u2022 Cardiovascular .\nCertain genes affect blood clotting , cholesterol metabolism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your blood vessels and any potential for raised blood pressure .\n\u2022 Energy .\nEveryone gains and loses weight differently and for some it \u2019 s harder than others .\nYour genes influence your appetite and how full you feel at the end of a meal , your eating behavior , and how you store and burn up body fat .\n\u2022 Activity .\nYour SNPs can tell you about how your body responds to various types of physical activity , whether your body is conditioned for endurance exercise ( running , biking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2022 Nutrients .\nYour genes can also tell you how well your body absorbs and metabolizes nutrients .\nGenetics affects how your body processes caffeine , iron , fatty acids , choline , vitamin D , vitamin C , folate , and vitamin B12 etc .\nKnowing this information can help you make better and more targeted food choices .\nIf you \u2019 re interested in pursuing genetic testing through 3X4 , click this link !\nNot all genetic testing companies are equal .\nLook at what information they provide and if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifestyle , and supplements .\nSo , for example , if your SNPs impact your ability to methylate focusing on B-vitamins , limiting alcohol and chemical exposures that overload the methylation cycle are recommended .\n3X4 is one option\u2014 a simple cheek swab will get you all the answers described above .\nWhen you order 23andme or Ancestry.com ( costing about $ 100- $ 200 , versus $ 349 for 3X4 \u2019 s test ) , saliva tests , which you can order yourself , you get the raw data regarding your genes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a site like NutraHacker.com , which analyzes your genes to identify variants associated with detoxification and methylation for free .\nDetoxigenomics is another gene test you get through your health provider focusing on Phase I and II detoxification , and provides you with advice on how to minimize risks based on your profile ; they , too , offer insight into SNPs that prevent the metabolism of drugs like Coumadin , a blood thinner .\nOther tests are available that cater to athletes .\nWhen choosing a genetics company , be sure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report , who the scientists are who built the test , and how they manage privacy and ethics .\nAs an example , 23andme sells genetic data to pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline to use for drug development .\nMost importantly , no matter who you choose , make sure you get recommendations that you can use in your daily life .\nThe bottom line is this : acquiring an understanding of your genetic profile gives you a personalized blueprint for how to optimize your health , providing recommendations on what foods to eat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorporate or avoid , how to exercise effectively , how you might respond to certain drugs , how to proactively protect against diseases you may have more of a predisposition to like Alzheimer \u2019 s or cancer , etc .\nHere are some examples of SNPs : \u2022 Perhaps the most well-known SNP is MTHFR .\nThis gene provides the instructions to make an enzyme that converts a form of the B vitamin , folate , into the primary form of folate found in the body and necessary for the conversion of homocysteine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decreases the activity of the enzyme , but this can be supported with the right nutrition .\n\u2022 Genetic variations in the vitamin D receptor gene can influence how vitamin D is metabolized in your body , which may require you to supplement .\n\u2022 The NQ01 gene plays a vital role in helping the body remove toxins as well as ensuring the availability of CoQ10 , ubiquinol .\nA SNP in NQ01 may alter the need for additional CoQ10 .\nIt is always important to remember that no one SNP by itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should eat and the life you should live .\nBut when looked at together , they provide valuable insight into who you are and how you respond to the world around you .\nJust because you have a genetic predisposition does not mean you are predestined to become ill .\nThis moves us from the realm of genetics to epigenetics , the study of how your choices , behaviors and the environment affect the way your genes behave .\nA fascinating 2016 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine provides a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of epigenetics in health .\nThe study , \u201c Genetic Risk , Adherence to a Healthy Lifestyle , and Coronary Disease , \u201d analyzed data from four other studies totaling 55,685 participants .\nThe purpose was to assess the relationship between genetic profile and lifestyle factors in cardiovascular disease risk .\nFifty SNPs were identified that were strongly associated with coronary artery disease .\nParticipants were also given a lifestyle quality score determined by factors like body mass index , smoking history , physical activity level , and diet quality .\nGenetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe authors concluded : \u201c Among participants at high genetic risk , a favorable lifestyle was associated with a nearly 50 % lower relative risk of coronary artery disease than was an unfavorable lifestyle.\n\u201d What this means is that a healthy lifestyle can help to overcome and compensate for a genetic predisposition to disease .\nThis shows the power of knowing your genetic profile and the profound effect diet and lifestyle changes can have on your profile .\nWe reported previously on the effect that diet has on gene expression .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a diet of 65 percent carbohydrates turned on genes that cause inflammation in the body in addition to genes associated with the development of cardiovascular disease , some cancers , dementia , and type 2 diabetes .\nOther animal studies have shown that fatty acids have an impact on the expression of more than 300 genes .\nIt isn \u2019 t just diet that affects gene expression .\nExposures to environmental chemicals modifies multiple biological processes including gene expression .\nRecent research into why and how heavy metal exposures cause cancer suggests that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy metal exposures , for example , may silence DNA repair and tumor-suppressing genes .\nExposures to endocrine disrupting chemicals like BPA also have epigenetic effects .\nSometimes , the changes brought about as a consequence of diet and environmental exposures are passed on to subsequent generations .\nHealth and healing begin with an understanding of our \u201c hardware \u201d as it pertains to our genetics and what that tells us about our individual needs ; but we also need to understand that our lifestyle and environment provide the \u201c software \u201d that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c hardware \u201d operates .\nThis article contains product affiliate links .\nWe may receive a commission if you make a purchase after clicking on one of these links .\nThanks for supporting the work that we do .",

letting on .\nAccording to news reports , the Biden Administration is weighing a plan that would allow all Americans to get a second booster of a COVID vaccine ; current CDC guidelines recommend a second booster only to those who are immunocompromised or over the age of 50 .\nUnfortunately , a hard look at the numbers shows reason to be wary of COVID boosters , with some data showing that those

natural immunity .\nThis shows that each of us need to weigh the pros and cons of vaccination very carefully and not just blindly accept government dogmas .\nThe dominant strains of the virus right now are omicron variants BA.4 and BA.5 .\nThe evidence so far suggests that these variants escape antibody responses among both those who have previously been infected and those who are fully vaccinated and boosted .\nResearchers noted a three-fold reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and BA.5 variants compared to older omicron variants , which were already more contagious than the strains targeted by the vaccines .\nIn plain terms , the dominant strains of the virus currently are the most contagious to date , and people are still contracting COVID who either previously had it or are fully vaccinated .\nNevertheless , governments are still calling for everyone to get vaccinated and boosted .\nOur friends at ANH-International looked at two recent data sets released by British and

authorities say that the data show that you \u2019 ll be 13 times less likely to die from COVID if you are fully boosted .\nA miracle !\nBut look at the data a different way , and you \u2019 ll find that the same data also tell a different story : you are 65 percent more likely to die from non-COVID deaths if you \u2019 re up-to-date on your vaccinations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by ANH-International , these wildly divergent findings indicate that the data is corrupted .\nThis was the conclusion reached by a group of researchers who explain their findings here and here .\nThe crux of the issue seems to be that the statisticians and health bureaucrats failed to accurately report deaths and omitted deaths that occurred within two weeks of vaccination , skewing the numbers .\nAnd , of course , these data do not take into account that new variants are evading vaccine-induced immunity much more readily than previous strains .\nA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data .\nAgain , data was released along with the message to go get boosted .\nAgain , there are glaring inconsistencies .\nThis report is dealing with omicron variants BA.4 and BA.5 .\nFirst , the report states that only six people under the age of 65 died from COVID this year so far ; all six had underlying conditions that increase the risk of severe disease , and all six had received at least two doses of the vaccine ( four had received three doses ) .\nFurther , data from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been vaccinated between one and four times against COVID-19 were 45 times more likely to be hospitalized than if they were unvaccinated ; receiving four shots meant you were 100 times more likely to be hospitalized .\nIt isn \u2019 t clear how much of this increased risk is due to the fact that those receiving a fourth booster at this point are already more prone to hospitalization and death ( since they are older and/or immunocompromised ) \u2014or , could the vaccinations themselves be negatively impacting health and resilience ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ health authorities do not seem very curious about these questions .\nThe FDA recently decided that current shots should be \u201c updated \u201d with an omicron component for fall 2022 .\nBut there are problems with this approach .\nThis has to do with \u201c immune imprinting \u201d or \u201c original antigenic sin.\n\u201d These terms refer to the body \u2019 s immune system to rely on antigens from previous infection when a slightly different version of that pathogen is encountered , leaving the immune system \u201c trapped \u201d by the first response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this means that , for those who have been vaccinated , the original mRNA shots dominate the immune response even after receiving an omicron-specific booster .\nThe same logic would apply to natural immunity acquired from previous infection\u2014many people have gotten COVID two and three times .\nMeanwhile , the factors that have made our country so susceptible to COVID in the first place remain unaddressed

almost see the smile on the reporter \u2019 s face at The New York Times who wrote the headline : \u201c Study Finds Another Condition That Vitamin D Pills Don \u2019 t Help.\n\u201d The study on which the article is based did indeed conclude that vitamin D supplementation did not reduce the risk of bone fractures compared to placebo .\nSeveral glaring problems with the study were completely ignored by the media .\nWorse still , some have used the study to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients is useless .\nUnfortunately , this is what we \u2019 ve come to expect from mainstream medicine and the media who dutifully pounce on any opportunity to bash supplements .\nThe most harmful consequence of this study comes from an editorial discussing the results .\nIt argues that , since the study shows that \u201c vitamin supplements do not have important health benefits\u2026there is no justification for measuring [ vitamin D levels ] in the general population or treating to a target serum level.\n\u201d The idea that this study shows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and money is absolutely ludicrous but will be music to the ears of insurers and Medicare who will use this as ammunition to no

immune enhancement , for metabolic disorders , preventing sepsis , and protecting the brain .\nHow many Americans won \u2019 t get their vitamin D levels checked , or simply stop taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on these recommendations ?\nThis is a particularly irresponsible position to take considering government data show that 95 percent of Americans are not getting enough vitamin D. That number will now likely increase thanks to the editorial \u2019 s authors and those who think like them .\nThe study itself found that adults over 50 years of age taking 2,000 IU vitamin D per day for 5.3 years did not result in reduced fracture risk .\nFew of the participants in the study were deficient in vitamin D before the study ; average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the study were 40 ng/mL .\nAs we \u2019 ve explained previously , the 2,000 IU dose and the blood level achieved by that dose are both far too low .\nSome recommend achieving circulating blood levels of at least 50 ng/mL vitamin D ; some integrative health experts recommend achieving 80 ng/mL .\nAchieving such levels requires supplementing with about 5,000-8,000 IU vitamin D per day , perhaps even more , depending on the individual .\n( Achieving the right vitamin D levels is highly dependent on an individual \u2019 s biology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a healthcare professional , because blood levels need to be monitored . )\nAnother factor that should be considered when reviewing this study is that vitamins and minerals often work synergistically ; this is why randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) , considered the gold standard of scientific evidence , are often inappropriate for studying supplements .\nIntegrative health experts know that vitamin D works with calcium and vitamin K to protect bones .\nVitamins D and K play a central role in calcium metabolism .\nVitamin D helps increase calcium levels in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body use this calcium by bringing it to bones .\nIn fact , increasing vitamin D intake without adequate vitamin K can cause calcium deposits to build up in arteries , which can lead to heart disease .\nThis has been demonstrated in RCTs .\nFor example , a Japanese study on postmenopausal osteoporosis had four groups : one taking vitamin D alone , one taking vitamin K alone , one taking vitamins D and K together , and one group taking neither .\nThe study found that only the group taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mineral density .\nThese results were supported by a Korean study showing that the addition of vitamin K to vitamin D and calcium supplements increased bone mineral density after six months .\nSome studies have also found that vitamin D alone does help protect bones : compared to those taking a placebo or a smaller dose of vitamin D , those taking 800 to 2,000 IU vitamin D experienced 30 percent fewer hip fractures .\nBut why go into any of these details when you can write a snappy headline that uncritically accepts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The study was sponsored , among others , by the National Institutes of Health \u2019 s Office of Dietary Supplements and National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health .\nGiven the obvious failings of this study , it seems clear that these government agencies are looking out for the drug industry \u2019 s bottom line by supporting a narrative that supplements are useless .\nIt is ( sadly ) telling that the government programs that are supposed to be supportive of supplements and natural health are part of such a deeply flawed study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOT to use supplements .\nIt \u2019 s no wonder that public health agencies have lost the public trust .\nThis all shows that the media can not be trusted when it comes to dietary supplements ; nor can the government .\nThey are too captured by conventional thinking , as supported by the American Medical Association and Big Pharma .\nThis thinking is simple : only drugs can treat disease , so anything not a drug claiming to do so is snake oil .\nIt \u2019 s these kinds of narratives that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( D-IL ) make his case for why we need more supplement regulations , since they add to the impression cultivated by critics that consumers are being duped by bad actors .\nWe can not let them succeed .\nAction Alert !\nWrite to Congress and tell them to oppose mandatory product listing for supplements .\nPlease send your message immediately .", "author": "ANH-USA", "url": "https://anh-usa.org/nyts-supplement-vendetta-is-getting-old/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=nyts-supplement-vendetta-is-getting-old", "published": "Tue, 02 Aug 2022 16:25:32 +0000", "published_utc": 1659471932, "collection_utc": 1659477748}, {"id": "alliancefornaturalhealth--2022-08-02--New Bill to Remove FDA Control Over Supplements", "date": "2022-08-02", "source": "alliancefornaturalhealth", "title": "New Bill to Remove FDA Control Over Supplements", "content": "A new bill would take food and supplements out of the FDA \u2019 s jurisdiction under a new food safety agency .\nWe are cautiously optimistic , but there are concerns .\nAction Alert !\nThe new bill , introduced by Sen.

toxicants : food can be contaminated with microorganisms , pesticides , residues from industrial manufacturing , or heavy metals .\nMethods of food preparation can also affect the toxin load of food .\nFor example , cooking meats at high temperatures converts nitrogen-containing compounds in the meat to acrylamide , a \u201c probable human carcinogen.\n\u201d Outside of the diet , exposure to volatile organic compounds in the air is a concern .\nIn fact , the home is among the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Building materials ( floor and wall coverings , particle board , adhesives , and paints ) can \u201c off-gas \u201d and release toxicants into the air .\nAn EPA study detected toxic benzene , commonly used in disinfectants , in 98 percent of adults .\n\u201c Off-gassing \u201d is especially a concern in newly built or remodeled buildings ( and even new cars ) .\nNew carpet is especially dangerous : in testing of over 400 carpet samples , neurotoxins were present in over 90 percent of samples in quantities sufficient in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trap environmental toxins : one study found an average of 12 pesticide residues per carpet samples .\nThe authors concluded that this route of exposure likely provides infants and toddlers with nearly all of their non-dietary exposure to pesticides .\nWhile it is important to support the body \u2019 s detoxification mechanisms to make sure they are functioning optimally ( a topic we will return to subsequently ) , it \u2019 s also a good idea to limit the exposures your body is burdened with .\nHere are some tips on how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the skin do not pass through the gut so can be more dangerous than pollutants that are ingested .\nThe Environmental Working Group ( EWG ) evaluates cosmetics and rates them on a safety scale .\nThey will alert you to the presence of harmful ingredients that should be avoided like triclosan and triclobarban in soaps and toothpaste , aluminum in deodorants , phthalates , parabens , and retinoids in moisturizers , boric acid in diaper cream , heavy metals in makeup , formaldehyde in nail polish , and oxybenzone in sunscreens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It \u2019 s best to choose cleaning products that are free of volatile organic compounds .\nEWG also publishes a free guide recommending top green cleaning products .\nIt \u2019 s also possible to make your own cleaning products with some simple ingredients .\nSee guides here and here for information on how to do so .\nChoosing organic , locally grown produce when possible is your best chance to avoid exposures to dangerous pesticides .\nOrganic , grass-fed meat should be free of growth hormones and antibiotics .\nIn choosing fish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the body is an interesting marker for its toxic burden ; the bigger the mouth in relation to body size , the bigger the toxic burden\u2014sardines have less mercury than swordfish or tuna .\nAvoiding processed food completely will limit your exposure to dangerous food additives .\nThe dangers of being exposed to hormone disrupting chemicals , even at low levels , is well-established .\nHere are some tips for avoiding chemicals like BPA and other endocrine disruptors : \u2022 Avoid plastic storage containers for food and drinks and use stainless steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2022 Use parchment paper , beeswax , or aluminum foil instead of plastic wrap .\n\u2022 Avoid canned food ; many say \u201c BPA-free , \u201d but we know that common replacements for BPA are just as dangerous .\n\u2022 Eat out less ; studies have found those who eat at home with fresh ingredients have lower levels of BPA .\n\u2022 Avoid putting plastic in the dishwasher , freezer , and microwave , since hot and cold temperatures cause more phthalates to be released .\n\u2022 Opt out of receipts if possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BPA\u2014years ago , we submitted a Citizens Petition to put a stop to this practice , but the government refused .\n\u2022 Choose wood or cloth toys for children rather than plastic .\nDrinking water in the US is contaminated with a variety of chemicals and pollutants like PFAS \u201c forever chemicals , \u201d prescription drugs , arsenic , fluoride , phthalates , BPA , organophosphate pesticides , and more .\nReverse osmosis ( RO ) filtration is said to remove 99 percent of toxic chemicals in water .\nNote that RO filtration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must remineralize the water which can be done in a variety of ways .\nAs alluded to above , the air inside the home is one of the biggest sources of exposure to toxins and toxicants outside of the diet .\nWater damage is one of the main culprits ; mold can grow in 24 to 48 hours after water damage occurs .\nA HEPA filter will remove ultrafine particles like dust and viruses from the air , and an air sanitizer will remove allergens , germs , and mold .\nThis post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While it is important to take steps to limit our exposure to environmental contaminants , it is equally crucial to ensure our body \u2019 s ability to deal with unavoidable toxic assaults is functioning properly .\nIn future coverage we will take an in-depth look at how to optimize your ability to detox .\nHealth

91 toxic chemicals in their blood and urine .\nThis is a testament to the fact that our exposure to new-to-nature chemicals is greater than it \u2019 s ever been during our evolution and how crucial it is to support our body \u2019 s ability to neutralize and remove these toxins .\nLeft unchecked , these exposures to environmental contaminants can wreak havoc on your health : chemicals in the environment play a role in mental health issues , neurodegenerative disorders , kidney and liver disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as obesity and diabetes .\nPart one of our coverage of detoxification looked how to avoid toxins ; part two will tell you how to support your body \u2019 s ability to remove them .\nThere are many diets and products on the market that purport to help you \u201c detox.\n\u201d Note , though , that the body is generally very effective at detoxifying itself , as long as it has the proper vitamins , minerals , and other nutrients .\nMany of the products being marketed as \u201c detox \u201d teas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are billed as quick fixes .\nSome of these products may work to push toxins out , but they may not help address underlying problems that impair detoxification like missing critical nutrients\u2014meaning the toxins could circulate and reabsorb .\nDetoxification refers to the metabolic pathway that processes unwanted chemicals\u2014both foreign substances and byproducts of the body \u2019 s natural processes\u2014for elimination and is comprised of three steps .\nPhase I detoxification involves using enzymes to break down toxins from fat-soluble compounds to water-soluble compounds\u2014the results of phase I are often more toxic than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further increases the water solubility of the compounds from phase I and decreases their toxicity .\nPhase III deals with the excretion of the water-soluble compounds created throughout phase I and II via the liver or the kidneys .\nThe balance of phase I and phase II detoxification is crucial .\nAs noted above , the products of phase I detoxification are often more toxic than the original compound .\nThis isn \u2019 t a problem if phase II enzymes are functioning at a rate sufficient to neutralize the phase I products , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance off and produce a situation on which harmful metabolites are produced faster than they can be detoxified .\nThese factors include diet ( charbroiled meats induce phase I activity without inducing phase II enzymes ) , smoking and alcohol consumption ( which induce phase I activity ) , age ( which decreases phase II activity ) , disease ( diseases of the liver compromise detoxification ) , and genetics ( that is , genetic differences cause some to have enzymes with lower activity , meaning they do not detoxify through certain pathways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast Phase 1 and slow phase 2 person , due to SNPs , is the worst ( and very common ) scenario .\nThat \u2019 s why it \u2019 s really good to work with a professional .\nThe lymphatic system is also crucial to detoxification .\nThe lymph system carries cellular waste and other toxins to the lymph nodes , which act like a garbage disposal .\nIllness , lack of physical activity , and not drinking enough water can slow down the lymph system .\nSymptoms of a lymph system that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brain fog , puffy skin , swollen and stiff joints , chronic headaches , and inflammation .\nNatural ways to cleanse the lymph system are eating plenty of fruits and vegetables , sleeping in loose fitting clothing ( the body goes through a natural detox process at night , so you don \u2019 t want to constrict the movement of the lymph system ) , exercise , and practice mindful breathing to minimize stress on the lymph system .\nGiven that it involves an incredibly diverse array of enzymes and transport proteins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of nutrients .\nA 2014 review found that diets rich in fruits and vegetables helps protect against environmental toxic stressors .\nOther evidence shows that adequate intakes of minerals reduces uptake of heavy metals .\nConversely , inflammatory diets , such as those high in processed foods , increase the toxic effects of PCBs ( Polychlorinated biphenyls ) .\nGenerally speaking , exposures to toxins and toxicants induce chronic oxidative stress and a dysregulated immune response ; anti-inflammatory foods like fruits and vegetables help protect against these effects .\nEfficient phase I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A , B2 and B3 , folate , C , E , iron , calcium , copper , zinc , magnesium , and selenium .\nA wide variety of compounds are known to stimulate and support phase II enzymes , including : EGCG ( epigallocatechin gallate ) from green tea , resveratrol , curcumin , alpha lipoic acid , alpha tocopherol ( a form of vitamin E ) , lycopene ( a red carotenoid found in tomatoes , grapefruit , watermelon , and other red fruits and vegetables ) , apple polyphenols , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many others .\nWe \u2019 ve written previously about the importance of N-acetyl-L-cysteine ( NAC ) , which is a precursor to glutathione , one of the body \u2019 s most important antioxidants and detoxifying agents .\nMilk thistle is also widely recommended by integrative experts for supporting detoxification , lowering oxidative stress in the liver , and conserving glutathione levels .\nAs alluded to above , genetics plays an important role in detoxification because our genes code for the various enzymes that carry out these processes .\nThis means that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caffeine or alcohol , but slower at breaking down histamine or prescription medications .\nAdditionally , detoxification of various compounds from pesticides , cigarette smoke , and grilled/charred meats can be compromised by polymorphisms in CYP1A1 or CYP1A2 genes that code for enzymes involved in Phase 1 detoxification .\nOptimizing our body \u2019 s ability to detoxify requires us to support the methylation process , one of the reactions that occurs in phase II .\nIf we think of the body as a complex machine with many gears and switches , methylation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function and it also turns switches on and off .\nMethylation requires B vitamins , zinc , magnesium , choline , glycine , betaine , and methionine to function properly .\nWe discussed methylation and the genetic SNPs that can affect it in our article on genetics .\nWe also know that a growing subset of the population has a genetic predisposition to multiple chemical sensitivities ( MCS ) .\nMCS is a condition that affects an estimated 13 percent of the US population , nearly 43 million people .\nSome speculate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variation that prevents the production of glutathione , thus impairing the body \u2019 s ability to detoxify .\nPromoting gut health is another factor in optimizing our detoxification systems .\nProbiotics have been shown to reduce mercury and arsenic levels in pregnant women and children ; in vitro experiments have shown that probiotics decreased pesticide accumulation .\nCertain probiotic species can help digest endotoxins ( bacterial toxins ) and reduce the toxin \u2019 s uptake in the body by supporting tight junctions in the intestinal lining .\nOther studies have shown that probiotics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exercise is beneficial as it increases blood levels of glutathione .\nThe bottom line : Given all of the factors that influence detoxification , it is best to work with an integrative medical practitioner to determine the best detox program that takes into account your genetic background

some alarm among the population\u2014are we entering another COVID situation , with lockdowns and efforts at forced vaccination ?\nAre there natural interventions that can help protect us from this new virus ?\nContextualizing the threat from monkeypox may help alleviate some of these fears .\nIt \u2019 s important to note that monkeypox is a very different virus from the virus that causes COVID .\nMonkeypox is a virus similar to smallpox but less severe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1958 , it was primarily found in Central and West Africa , but recently it has spread to dozens of countries , but cases in the US have risen the sharpest .\nThere are likely more cases than currently being reported due to a testing bottleneck created in part by the federal government\u2014in this , the current outbreak does share similarities with COVID-19 .\nShortages of the primary vaccine to combat monkeypox also has not helped dispel fears among the communities most threatened by the virus .\nGenerally , the disease is manageable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , painful bumps and blisters , often in the genital area , accompanied by fever and lymph node swelling .\nThe rash can spread to the arms , legs , and face .\nThe virus is spread primarily through close , physical contact with a monkeypox sore during sex .\nIt can also spread through respiratory droplets and touching objects that have also touched monkeypox sores , but this is very different from COVID .\nThat is , the data we have so far from this outbreak suggests that these other routes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is usually from living with an infected person .\nInfection usually requires exposure to a lot of the virus ; the virus is concentrated most in the sores .\nExperts say it probably takes hours of repeatedly touching the virus on surfaces or breathing in particles to get infected .\nYou won \u2019 t get it from casual contact , like shaking someone \u2019 s hand , or trying on clothing at a department store .\nEven if you \u2019 re living with someone , the risk of catching it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the chance of spreading monkeypox to a household member , not through sex , is only about 0.6 percent .\nFor these reasons , some experts say it is accurate to think of monkeypox as a sexually transmitted disease , though there are some caveats .\nFor example , wearing a condom can prevent many sexually transmitted diseases , but with monkeypox , naked cuddling is a big risk .\nResearchers are still looking at whether monkeypox can be spread through semen , blood , urine , or other bodily fluids .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ is another open question at this point .\nWithout the sores that characterize monkeypox , it seems unlikely that an individual can generate enough virus to be contagious .\nBut a new Belgian study detected monkeypox in three men , none of whom had symptoms or any lesions .\nMore than 99 percent of the people infected with monkeypox in the US are men who have sex with men .\nThose who are at the highest risk for serious outcomes are those who have uncontrolled HIV infections .\nPart of the rationale for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to allow more data sharing between the federal government and the states , expand the resources available to combat the outbreak , and to increase access to medical care .\nEspecially given the crippling shortage of monkeypox vaccines , the government should be looking at natural medicines that have shown promise .\nA 2017 study found that resveratrol suppressed poxvirus replication ; Sarracenia purpurea , the purple pitcher plant , was used with apparent success in the 19th century to combat smallpox , and subsequent laboratory experiments have shown that it inhibits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicines developed to protect against smallpox may be used to prevent and treat monkeypox .\nIn terms of prevention , we would do well to apply the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic , and that is that our best defense is to ensure that our ecological terrain is healthy\u2014that is , we must maintain a healthy internal environment of the body ( good diet , exercise , nutrition , etc . )\nand a healthy external environment ( minimize stress , maintain positive relationships , and minimize exposure to environmental contaminants ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an excellent immune-support protocol for children going back to school during 2020 , but many of these lessons still apply .\nIt provides guidelines for vitamin D , vitamin C , and zinc supplementation for every age group .\nWe also know that 92 percent of Americans have a vitamin deficiency .\nIn fact , large studies have confirmed that most Americans are lacking in important micronutrients .\nStudies have shown that the immune system relies on micronutrients , and that supplements can help deliver these nutrients .\nYou can help protect yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assess your micronutrient status and correcting inadequacies .\nBecause of what we know about how monkeypox spreads , it doesn \u2019 t seem likely to produce a pandemic on the scale of COVID ; but we must guard against the eventuality that the government will use the monkeypox outbreak to further erode our freedoms\u2014particularly our right to use natural medicine to stay healthy .", "author": "ANH-USA", "url":

It is now established that the gut microbiota\u2014the trillions of microorganisms that reside in the digestive tract\u2014plays a crucial role in many important bodily functions , including immunity

the ability to inhibit inflammation .\nThe oral microbiome also helps regulate the acidity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have species that are able to convert arginine or urea in the diet to ammonia , which helps balance the pH in the mouth .\nThe oral microbiome also transforms nitrate from fruits and vegetables into nitrite , then nitric oxide , which helps regulate blood pressure .\nMany antiseptic

, smoking , genetic differences , and dysfunction of the salivary glands .\nOral dysbiosis leads to the formation of biofilms in the oral cavity that create communities of \u201c bad \u201d or pathogenic bacteria to grow , leading to periodontal disease .\nPeriodontal disease is the result of infections and inflammation of the gums and bone that surround and support the teeth .\nTooth decay and periodontal disease begin with plaque buildup .\nYou may notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wake up in the morning ; this biofilm is a breeding ground for bacteria .\nThe acidic byproducts of this bacterial activity cause tooth decay and the eventual formation of cavities .\nAs mentioned above , periodontal disease is linked to a lot of serious health conditions .\nPeople with periodontal disease tend to

Durbin \u2019 s policy had a section that called on Department of Health and the National Academies of Sciences , Engineering , and Medicine ( NASEM ) to create a list of supplement ingredients that could cause \u201c potentially serious adverse events \u201d and then develop mandatory warning labels for these supplements .\nWe believe that Sen. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eliminate these and other supplements , such as high dose products .\nEliminating access to curcumin would be a tragedy given its numerous health benefits .\nCurcumin is anti-inflammatory and supports brain , cardiovascular , joint , and muscle health .\nCompanies are also innovating ways to make curcumin supplements more bioavailable , since the compound is generally not absorbed well by the human body .\nThis is yet another reason to oppose Sen. Durbin \u2019 s policy .\nThese innovations would likely trigger additional \u201c new supplement \u201d regulations we \u2019 ve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mandatory product listing would give the FDA a master list to target and eliminate innovative products that do not comply with the agency \u2019 s ridiculous and overreaching regulations .\nThere is some good news , however .\nOver a dozen members of Congress signed on to an ANH-supported letter to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi ( D-CA ) and House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy ( R-CA ) calling for mandatory product listing to be removed from the bill to reauthorize FDA drug user fees .\nLed by Congressman Jeff Duncan ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that our advocacy on this issue is working !\nWe need to thank those who listened to your messages and signed this letter and urge other lawmakers to join the effort in opposing this disastrous policy .\nMomentum against mandatory product listing for supplements is growing .\nWe reported on some developments last month indicating that Senator Durbin and his allies may have a difficult time negotiating to keep mandatory product listing for supplements in the final version of the FDA user fee reauthorization bill .\nThis letter is further proof that forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anti-supplement policy .\nMandatory product listing requires supplement companies to register all their products with the FDA , the purpose of which is to allow the FDA to quickly scan the market for products to eliminate .\nWe \u2019 ve detailed our many concerns about this policy in our coverage since Sen. Durbin introduced his bill late last year .\nIt \u2019 s a prelude to European-style restrictions on dosage levels in supplements and will stifle innovation .\nIf Sen. Durbin and his allies get their way , the rich variety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to will be reduced to a few cookie-cutter products that make the most money .\nAdditionally , supplement \u201c registration \u201d can easily lead to pre-approval , which will cause supplements to cost as much as drugs .\nOnly those that can pay to play\u2014that is , those supplements owned by Big Pharma\u2014will remain , leaving only low-quality , low nutrient content products .\nThe rest will disappear .\nWe can \u2019 t let up ; we need to ramp up to make sure this policy is defeated an Americans can continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Action Alert !\nThank members of Congress who took action to remove the anti-supplement policy from the FDA drug user fee bill .\nSend a message to other lawmakers to oppose mandatory product listing for supplements .\nPlease send your message immediately .\n*Note : if you live in the district of one of the 15 members of Congress who signed Rep.

need to revitalize the mitochondria , our body \u2019 s cellular power plants .\nHere are natural strategies to do so .\nOne of the most common reasons for seeking medical care is fatigue .\nThirty-eight percent of the US workforce reported being fatigued in a recent study .\nAre so many of us simply not getting enough sleep , or working too hard ?\nThe real answers are likely internal\u2014that is , our bodies are not producing enough energy at the cellular level .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the vast majority of energy production , and dysfunctional mitochondria not only cause fatigue , but are the common denominator in many chronic diseases and even the aging process itself .\nLifestyle , illness , and age can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction , but the good news is there are many natural strategies that can be used to rejuvenate our cellular powerhouses .\nMitochondria are known as the \u201c battery \u201d or energy source of the cell .\nThese organelles are responsible for taking in nutrients , breaking them down , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main energy unit of the cell .\nATP provides at least 95 percent of the cellular energy that powers all living functions .\nWhen mitochondria do not function optimally , bad things happen .\nMitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in many , many common diseases , including early aging , Alzheimer \u2019 s disease , Parkinson \u2019 s , cardiovascular disease , autism , chronic fatigue syndrome , diabetes , dementia , and migraines .\nA byproduct of this energy production is the formation of free

have come across the term \u201c oxidative stress \u201d which contributes to aging and plays a role in the onset of chronic disease .\nThe primary source of oxidative stress in the body is mitochondrial dysfunction , specifically the leakage of oxygen and electrons from the mitochondria .\nThis leakage increases when certain key nutrients are missing ( more on this below ) .\nThe mitochondrial theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center of the aging process .\nAs we age , three changes occur .\nCells produce more free radicals that attack the mitochondria , naturally-occurring antioxidants that help protect mitochondria decline , and the accumulated damage to the mitochondria and mitochondrial DNA cause the mitochondria to decay , releasing even more free radicals .\nThese

is also directly related to excess fatigue .\nModerate to severe fatigue is caused on a cellular level by compromised energy production by the mitochondria , resulting in less energy available to the body .\nThe damage to mitochondria caused by free-radicals leads to abnormal cell signaling , premature cell senescence ( when cells stop dividing ) , inflammation , and apoptosis ( cell death @ @ @ @

dyes , but are they actually safer ?\nSomewhere between 66-74 percent of women use hair-coloring products .\nMany companies began offering \u201c organic \u201d products as concerns about the toxicity of some of the chemicals used in permanent or semi-permanent hair dyes rose\u2026 This gives consumers the impression that the products have safer , cleaner , non-toxic ingredients .\nUnfortunately , this is mostly a marketing gimmick .\n\u201d Hair dye \u201d is a broad term referring to many kinds of products .\nThey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is derived from the henna tree , or synthetic .\nSynthetic dyes can be temporary , semi-permanent , or permanent .\nGenerally speaking , natural dyes are temporary and last only a few weeks because the pigment from the dye is only penetrating the outer layer of the hair shaft .\nSemi-permanent and permanent hair dyes reach deeper into the hair shaft and last longer , but this effect requires a number of chemicals , several of which are associated with safety concerns .\nSemi-permanent or permanent hair dyes work by using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some ammonia-free products ) , hydrogen peroxide , and p-phenylenediamine ( PPD ) or one of its substitutes ( PTD , or para-toluene diamine or p-aminophenol ) .\nAmmonia pulls apart the hair \u2019 s layer of proteins so the dye can penetrate .\nHydrogen peroxide bleaches the hair and helps PPD , the coloring agent , adhere to the hair .\nPPD is of particular concern because it has been linked to cancer , as well as blood toxicity and birth defects .\nAccording to the Environmental Working Group \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , PPD substitutes , are also concerning , rated a 6 and a 7 ( 10 being the most toxic ) .\nAn expert writing for the United Kingdom \u2019 s Royal Society of Chemistry remarked that , \u201c It \u2019 s probably true that if these materials ( PPD and PTD ) were invented today , their use in cosmetics would not be permitted but they remain in use\u2026as no effective replacements have been found.\n\u201d If you \u2019 re looking for permanent hair dyes , they will contain PPD or one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other chemicals like resorcinol .\nWe \u2019 ve seen something similar play out before .\nWhen BPA started being linked to a host of negative health effects , \u201c BPA-free \u201d became a common marketing slogan on products .\nThey may have been BPA-free , but many used a substitute called BPS , which was just as toxic as BPA .\nSimilarly , there are many hair dyes that claim to be \u201c PPD-free \u201d but contain one of these substitutes that are not necessarily safer .\nThere are several other concerning ingredients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid .\nEthanolamine , a common substitute for ammonia , has been linked to birth defects and hair loss .\nAlthough it is not commonly used any more , lead acetate can be found in some products on the market .\nLead is a neurotoxin , and there are no safe levels of lead exposure .\nResorcinol , a hormone disruptor , is another common ingredient .\nMethylisothiazolinone and methylchloroisothiazolinone are preservatives that can cause serious allergic reactions , even in people who do not usually have allergies .\nFormaldehyde , a known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with leukemia , are also added to hair dyes .\nThese chemicals can be absorbed through the skin and directly enter the bloodstream .\nThey can also soak down into the hair follicle , which is highly vascularized .\nBecause of these ingredients , hair dyes are known to be toxic .\nThey can cause skin damage and allergic reactions .\nExposure to the eyes can cause anything from mild irritation to loss of vision .\nUnintentional swallowing can cause life-threatening allergic reactions .\nUnfortunately , due to these dangers , hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world as a form of self-harm .\nSome studies have found hair dyes increase the risk of non-Hodgkin \u2019 s lymphoma , leukemia and bladder cancer , but other studies have found no links to these cancers .\nIt can be difficult to assign causality given the breadth of our chemical exposures over years , but research looking at salon workers found that they commonly experience skin and respiratory problems .\nThey also had disproportionate rates of cancer .\nAdditionally , the World Health Organization concluded that occupational exposure to hair dyes was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PPD-free products on the market , but they are not permanent dyes , and results may only last for a few washes .\nThese products can \u2019 t change your hair color from light to dark or vice versa , but they can help conceal grey and add deeper tones to your hair color .\nAgain , outside of temporary dyes , the coloring effect in hair dyes is achieved by the activity of multiple chemicals .\nIf you want to avoid exposure to these types of chemicals , your only option is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it isn \u2019 t the case that all temporary hair dyes are safe\u2014many still contain the chemicals discussed above .\nBut there are temporary products available that are made from natural plant powders that do not contain chemicals .\nMany of these same dangers also apply to bleach , which involves a chemical reaction with the pigment in your hair to remove the color .\nBleach products can contain hydrogen peroxide and ammonium persulfate , which can be poisonous .\nThe chemicals in hair bleach can cause itchiness , contact dermatitis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning sensations .\nThere are several alternatives to chemical bleaches for lightening hair , like lemon juice , apple cider vinegar , or chamomile tea .\nWhat about hair dyes being marketed as \u201c organic \u201d ?\nAs far as hair dyes are concerned , \u201c organic \u201d is meaningless .\nOrganic standards are for agricultural products and regulated by the USDA .\nThe FDA , which oversees cosmetics , does not regulate the use of the term \u201c organic \u201d for cosmetics .\nSome ingredients in these products can be organic\u2014but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have nothing to do with hair coloring .\nFor example , Natulique \u2019 s tagline is \u201c Certified Organic Beauty \u201d and their website has pretty pictures depicting the botanicals their products contain .\nBut dig deeper and you see that some of these products also contain things like resorcinol , PPD , and a laundry list of other chemicals .\nWomen of color appear to be at particular risk .\nA report by the National Institutes of Health noted an increased risk of breast cancer among all women using hair dyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a 45 percent higher risk compared to white women .\nWhat about henna ?\nHenna is derived from the leaves of the henna plant .\nThe powdered leaves are made into a paste and applied to the hair or skin .\nThere are pros and cons of using henna .\nIt can be difficult and tedious to apply , and the color spectrum is limited due to the natural color of henna .\nBut because it doesn \u2019 t involve the chemicals of other dyes , it may be a good option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; though be wary of products with unsafe additives like silver nitrate , carmine , chromium , and others .\nSome products labeled as \u201c black henna \u201d should be avoided because they contain PPD , which has caused scarring when applied to the skin .\nIf you want to avoid troubling chemicals , you may want to steer clear of permanent hair dyes entirely and stick to those that are temporary .\nEven semi-permanent hair dyes may contain the concerning chemicals discussed in this article .\nAlways be sure to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if the product says \u201c organic \u201d or \u201c natural .\n\u201d", "author": "ANH-USA", "url":

this damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that include sensible supplementation with proven nutrients , which most Americans do not get enough of .\nThe report looks at coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , osteoporosis , age-related macular degeneration , cognitive decline , irritable bowel syndrome , and childhood development disorders .\nKey supplements that help with each condition were examined , leading to estimates about how supplementation could affect incidence of that disease and healthcare costs .\nTake coronary artery disease , for example .\nA review of the medical literature shows that supplementing with preventive levels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 10 percent for CAD events .\nIf people at risk for CAD events supplement with fish oil , the report estimates that 174,811 CAD events could be

supplementation could prevent 93,349 CAD events resulting in $ 3 billion in healthcare savings .\nVitamin K2 was found to reduce the risk for CAD events by 15.7 percent , meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoided , resulting in $ 8.86 billion in savings .\nSupplementing with vitamin D and calcium at preventive levels was found to reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures by 14 percent , meaning 335,518 fractures can be avoided with these supplements , along with $ 17 billion in cost savings .\nOur current health system does not incentivize taking advantage of these strategies for reducing disease incidence .\nRemember , the FDA relies heavily on financial support from the drug industry : the agency receives 45 % of its operating budget directly from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ user fees \u201d ( used for the approval of new drugs , biologics and devices ) , but 65 % of the funding for human drug regulatory activities are derived from user fees .\nThis is one of the reasons the FDA makes it so

drug companies make money by selling us expensive pills you need to take for years to treat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of chronic diseases .\nThen , of course , there are the lawmakers like Senator Dick Durbin ( D-IL ) who want to enact policies that will restrict supplement choices and access as we \u2019 ve been explaining in recent coverage .\nSen. Durbin \u2019 s legislation takes us one step closer to European-style restrictions on supplements that severely restrict the nutrients that supplements can contain .\nWhy does this matter ?\nTo take one example : the report stated that the level of magnesium needed to prevent CAD events was about 400 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of magnesium in supplements to 250mg .\nThis is just a taste of the kinds of restrictions that will come our way if Sen.

ravaging this country\u2014but did you know that , of the ten leading causes of death in the US , chronic , low-level inflammation contributes to the development of seven of those diseases ( heart disease , cancer , respiratory disease , Alzheimer \u2019 s diabetes , and nephritis ) ?\nLow-grade inflammation isn \u2019 t something a conventional doctor will discuss with you , but having it is like a ticking time bomb for your health .\nInflammation is linked with immune function .\nWhen your body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sends out inflammatory cells to attack the pathogen or heal damaged tissue .\nIn these situations , like a sore throat , you experience the classic symptoms of inflammation : redness , swelling , heat , pain , and loss of function .\nThis is \u201c acute \u201d inflammation and is healthy and normal .\nWhat isn \u2019 t healthy\u2014but becoming all too normal\u2014is when your body sends out inflammatory cells when you are not sick or injured .\nSymptoms of chronic inflammation may include body pain , chronic fatigue , depression , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gastrointestinal complications , or frequent infections .\nThis chronic inflammation is the commonality between many chronic diseases , but the problem is that inflammation is not something that is generally tracked by mainstream healthcare providers until it \u2019 s too late .\nFor example , to meet the criteria for a diagnosis for Addison \u2019 s disease , an autoimmune condition , 90 percent of your adrenal gland has to have been damaged .\nBut it \u2019 s not just Addison \u2019 s disease or other autoimmune conditions ; conventional doctors are missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease , diabetes , respiratory disease , Alzheimer \u2019 s and more .\nConventional medicine also fails to recognize the spectrum of inflammation and disease : some people may have \u201c silent inflammation , \u201d where lab tests show some signs of high antibodies circulating in your blood , but there are no symptoms .\nOther patients higher on the inflammation spectrum don \u2019 t feel well and have some symptoms , but they don \u2019 t fit the standardized criteria for a disease .\nIt is only when symptoms progress that conventional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these treatments not address the root cause of the inflammation that led to disease ; doctors miss an opportunity to detect and address the inflammation far earlier .\nThat is the conventional model : wait until the disease progresses to a stage where expensive and dangerous drugs are given rather than acting earlier to prevent the disease from progressing further with diet , lifestyle changes , and supplementation with targeted nutrients .\nA number of factors can lead to chronic inflammation .\n\u2022 Exposures to environmental chemicals causes mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more free radicals are produced which cause inflammation in the body .\n\u2022 Stress .\nInflammation is the body \u2019 s response to a threat , whether it \u2019 s a pathogen or an emotional stressor .\nIn this state , the immune system sends out pro-inflammatory cytokines to deal with the threat .\nThese cytokines usually deal with the invader then disappear , but when stress is chronic , they don \u2019 t go away .\nProlonged stress means we are overexposed to the stress hormone cortisol , reducing its effectiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSleep deprivation is associated with markers of inflammation .\nBlood pressure drops during sleep and the vessels relax .\nWhen sleep is restricted , blood pressure doesn \u2019 t decline , which could trigger cells in blood vessel walls that activate inflammation .\n\u2022 Periodontal disease is another factor that can cause system wide inflammation .\n\u2022 Diet is another important cause : the standard American diet , high in ultra-processed foods , sugar , and starch , promotes inflammation .\nSixty percent of the calories in the typical American diet come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diet , a dysregulated gut also promotes inflammation : 70 percent of our immune system resides in the gut .\nA healthy microbiome allows us to regulate our immune system properly .\nPoor diet and food sensitivities ( such as to gluten ) cause permeability in the gut and intestinal lining allowing undigested food and toxins to enter the blood stream , triggering inflammation .\n\u2022 Silent infections .\nMany people have an infection but don \u2019 t have any symptoms , as we \u2019 ve seen with COVID-19 .\nBut , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body can be on the inflammation spectrum.Long standing physical injuries .\nWe can see the effects of inflammation when we have a physical injury , usually in the form of redness and swelling .\nBut that inflammation can become chronic if the injury doesn \u2019 t heal properly or is repeatedly injured .\nThese causes of inflammation indicate the solutions .\nDiet is a major component .\nConsider that the human genome hasn \u2019 t changed in 10,000 years , but only recently have we seen an explosion of chronic diseases .\nGenetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for thousands of years , so why is this happening now ?\nThis trend just happens to coincide with major changes in the food we eat , with our industrialized food system and ultra-processed foods , and an explosion in our exposure to environmental chemicals ( read our previous Health from the Ground Up articles on avoiding and removing toxins and the basics of detoxification ) .\nStunning changes can be achieved by altering diet .\nOne of the effects of chronic inflammation is to cause a disconnect between our ancient , limbic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or flight response , and our frontal lobe , the \u201c adult in the room \u201d that controls executive function .\nInflammation , then , can lead to anger , aggression , and violent acts .\nStudies in prisons and juvenile detention centers have found that swapping out pro-inflammatory foods for anti-inflammatory foods , or including a multivitamin supplement , can dramatically reduce violent incidents .\nAs mentioned above , when conventional doctors address inflammation , it \u2019 s usually with drugs that are not fixing what is actually causing your inflammation .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your genetic predispositions , chemical exposures , stress levels , diet , sleep , the status of your gut , etc .\nAn integrative health practitioner will consult with you to determine the cocktail of influences that are causing inflammation .\nIntegrative doctors will also test for the presence of biomarkers for inflammation like C-reactive protein and interleukin-1 , 6 and 8 .\nThere is also exciting research in this area .\nCompanies like Edifice Health are identifying even more biomarkers of inflammation to identify the markers common to many chronic diseases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your care , fixing your gut and your diet , regular exercise , meditation , yoga , and other stress relieving activities , and getting enough sleep are common factors in addressing inflammation .\nThere are also a variety of supplements that help with inflammation like omega-3 fatty acids , vitamin D , probiotics , curcumin , green tea , magnesium , zinc , selenium ,

crucial to health , but many people may not be aware of challenges in achieving this balance due to insufficient nutrients or genetic predisposition .\nMany of us know by now that regularly eating fish , or taking fish oil supplements , has heart-protective and anti-inflammatory effects on our health .\nThis is due to the omega-3 fatty acid content of these foods .\nUnfortunately , the Western diet has seen a much more pronounced rise in consumption of omega-6 fatty acids .\nWhen the ratio of omega-6 and omega-3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bad things happen to our health as we \u2019 re witnessing in the steady rise of chronic , inflammatory diseases like heart disease , type 2 diabetes , autoimmune conditions , and more .\nMany people may not be aware that certain populations have genetic predispositions that increase their need for certain omega-3s because their bodies can not convert plant forms to the forms needed by the body .\nOther people may lack the necessary nutrients to perform these important conversions .\nAchieving the right balance is so critical because 1 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 2 ) too much omega-6 in the diet crowds out metabolism of omega-3s .\nMost omega-3s in the diet come from plant foods like nuts and seeds in the form of alpha-linolenic acid ( ALA ) , which needs to be converted to eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) and docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) ; omega-6s also need to be converted .\nBoth conversions are performed by the same set of enzymes .\nIf you eat a lot of processed foods that are high in omega-6s , when you do eat foods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your body won \u2019 t be able to convert them to the anti-inflammatory compounds that benefit health .\nA diet with a higher proportion of omega-6 will increase inflammation and make you more susceptible to disease .\nWe need to eat fish or fish oil to get the important long-chain omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA .\nIt is possible for the body to synthesize EPA and DHA from ALA found in foods like walnuts , flax seed , and pumpkin seeds , but this conversion is extremely limited : studies have found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is converted to EPA and 0-4 percent is converted to DHA .\nEPA and DHA have been shown to protect against many chronic diseases and reduce overall mortality .\nThis is particularly a concern for vegetarians who do not eat fish and try to get their omega-3 from plant sources .\nAdditionally , the conversion of ALA to DHA depends on iron , among other nutrients , and the bioavailability of iron from plant sources is also quite low compared to animal sources .\nThis is another reason that vegetarians are poor converters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ALA to EPA and DHA also requires B vitamins , calcium , copper , zinc , and magnesium .\nPopulations who are deficient in these vitamins and minerals will have an impaired ability to convert omega-3s into the useful forms .\nCertain conditions like Crohn \u2019 s disease , celiac disease , HIV , and alcohol use disorder prevent the body from absorbing B vitamins , as are older adults and pregnant women\u2014so these populations may also have an impaired ability to convert ALA to EPA and DHA .\nFurther , certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the FADS genes influence how well the body converts ALA into EPA and DHA .\nSpecifically , the enzyme that converts ALA to EPA and DHA has reduced activity in people who carry the minor allele in FADS1 and FADS2 , which means they have lower levels of EPA .\nFor these individuals , it is critical to either eat fish regularly or to supplement with fish oil containing EPA and DHA .\nResearch has found that those with African ancestry tend to have efficient conversion enzymes , and those with Native American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ omega fatty acids in balance requires us to reduce intake of omega-6 fats and increase intake of omega-3 fats .\nMost processed foods contain oils and fats high in omega-6s like sunflower , cottonseed , soybean , and corn oils .\nRestaurants also commonly use these fats because they are so cheap .\nIt is theoretically possible to increase omega-3 intake without adjusting omega-6 intake , but this isn \u2019 t advisable , as it would require eating about 11 ounces of fish a day .\nRather , most experts recommend both reducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other fats high in omega-6 , and increasing intake of omega-3s by , for example , eating a 4-ounce portion of salmon twice a week .\nIt \u2019 s important to try to get wild salmon , though : the omega-6/omega-3 ratio in farmed salmon is about 14:1 , vs 3:1 for wild salmon .\nEating farmed salmon will still raise DHA levels , but wild salmon does this without delivering as many omega-6s .\nThis basic principle is true of most other farmed fish compared to wild counterparts : farmed fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAs a side note , this is why farmed salmon is often dyed pink : wild salmon are naturally pink because of the crustaceans and other food they eat in the wild that help impart the higher in omega-3 content .\nFarmed salmon is naturally gray because they are not fed krill and shrimp .\nGrass-fed beef is another source of EPA and DHA ; note that grass-fed beef has seven times as much omega-3 fatty acids than conventional beef , which has almost none .\nWhat about foods like avocados , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15:1 ?\nSimply put , avocados are still a healthy food because , while it has more omega-6s , the total content of omega fatty acids is relatively low .\nMost of the fat in an avocado is monounsaturated , and most of that is oleic acid , which has been shown to reduce certain biomarkers of inflammation .\nIf this is all too confusing , an integrative practitioner , nutritionist , or health coach can help guide you to achieve the right balance in your diet .\nAnthropological research shows that our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acids in a ratio roughly of 1:1 ; they were also free of modern inflammatory diseases like heart disease , cancer , and diabetes .\nThe industrialization of our food supply has disrupted this balance dramatically .\nToday , our ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fats is more like 20:1 , in some cases 25:1 .\nThis is why there are some studies that find no benefit from taking a fish oil supplement : 1,000 mg of fish oil isn \u2019 t going to help your heart if you \u2019 re also ingesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Achieving a 1:1 ratio in today \u2019 s world is very difficult , so experts generally recommend achieving a range of 1-5:1 .\nGetting these ratios in balance is a matter of life and death .\nOne study found that replacing corn oil with olive oil and canola oil to reach an 4:1 omega-6/omega-3 ratio led to a 70 percent decrease in total mortality .\nElevated omega-6 intake is associated with an increase in all inflammatory diseases that are killing Americans in record numbers .\nGetting the right balance of omega-3 and omega-6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical pillar of health and resilience .", "author": "ANH-USA", "url":

Dick Durbin ( D-IL ) and his allies are working to add this regulation to another must-pass government spending bill , so we have to keep up the pressure .\nAccording to reports , mandatory product listing for supplements could still be added to an end-of-the-year bill to continue funding the government that must be passed by December 16th .\nAs we \u2019 ve been telling you , Senator Dick Durbin ( D-IL ) and Senator Patty Murray ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months to attach mandatory product listing for supplements to the must-pass FDA user fee reauthorization bill .\nThey know Senator Durbin \u2019 s original standalone bill , S. 4090 , the Dietary Supplement Listing Act , has little chance of passing on its own because it lacks broad support and isn \u2019 t a Congressional priority .\nAs a result , the Senators are looking for any opportunity to attach Durbin \u2019 s proposal to a larger legislative package that is certain to become law .\nTo recap : Durbin \u2019 s mandatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will increase prices for consumers and decrease available options , making it easy for the FDA to eliminate supplements that compete with the drugs that provide significant funding for the Agency .\nWe \u2019 ve argued that mandatory product registration is a prelude to eliminating high-dose dietary supplements , as the European Union is in the process of doing , and throttling innovation in the supplement sector that delivers American consumers a diverse array of cutting-edge products that support health .\nRecall , too , that the FDA has declared that NAC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stakeholders , including ANH , have pushed back and , for now , we still have access .\nOne version of Sen. Durbin \u2019 s bill sought to change that by including language that would have allowed the FDA to immediately remove CBD and NAC from the market when the agency determined they weren \u2019 t supplements ( which was in 2020 for NAC , and 2017 for CBD ) .\nThe FDA has been working to eliminate these products , but because we had time to fight back , the FDA is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale of NAC supplements .\nCBD supplements are technically still illegal , but while the agency develops its approach to CBD products , it only seems to be focusing enforcement actions on CBD companies making illegal health claims .\nAgain , this is , in part , due to the public outcry at the prospect of eliminating access to CBD outside of the FDA-approved drug which costs $ 32,500 a year .\nCongress has also stepped in with bills that would legalize CBD supplements .\nCBD and NAC are still threatened , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t able to axe them right off the bat , to Sen. Durbin \u2019 s chagrin .\nDurbin \u2019 s proposal is completely unnecessary as supplements are an overwhelmingly safe product category .\nIn 2021 , the FDA received a total of 2,333,453 adverse event reports .\nOf those , only 2,400 were related to dietary supplements .\nThat means that dietary supplements make up 0.1 % of the adverse event reports to the FDA .\nAdverse events from FDA

already spent tens of millions of dollars creating the NIH \u2019 s dietary supplement label database , which currently lists 125,000+ supplement product labels .\nWe must be vigilant : Senator Durbin and Senator Murray are still working to get mandatory product listing attached to a must-pass bill in 2022 .\nWe must make sure this doesn \u2019 t happen .\nAction Alert !\nWrite to Congress and tell

that four global non-governmental organizations , all with ties to Bill Gates\u2014the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , the Wellcome Trust , Gavi , and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations ( CEPI ) \u2014took on the role often played by national governments , except they aren \u2019 t accountable to democratic institutions .\nEven before the pandemic struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deal of power and influence over public health .\nAnthony Fauci , Gates , and the Wellcome Trust control 63 percent of the biomedical research on Earth through their funding .\nThe Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is the second largest contributor to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) .\nThis gives these individuals unprecedented authority to implement their agenda without public discourse or input .\nIt just so happens that this agenda is focused on developing and distributing vaccines that buttress the profits of the pharmaceutical industry .\nThis agenda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production : Gates is an evangelist of GMO foods and believes rich countries should switch over to 100 percent synthetic meat , for example .\nThe pandemic presented a golden opportunity to expand this power and influence .\nNational governments were woefully unprepared at the outset of the pandemic and scrambled to mount a response .\nThis meant there was little effort on the part of these governments to halt the spread of the virus overseas in low-income countries .\nThis is where the Gates Foundation and its allied organizations stepped in .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ pandemic , these organizations \u2019 leaders cultivated access to the highest echelons of power , spending $ 8.3 million to lobby US and European lawmakers for more resources .\nThe strategy paid off : the COVID relief package passed by Congress late in 2020 included a $ 4 billion commitment to Gavi .\nThis power and influence put these four organizations in the driver \u2019 s seat of WHO efforts to distribute COVID tests and treatments .\nThe initiative promised to deliver 500 million tests to low-and-middle income countries by the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 84 million tests had been procured , just 16 percent of its target .\nThey similarly fell short on delivering treatments to developing countries .\nSimilarly , they had a goal of delivering 245 million treatments to low- and middle-income countries by 2021 but later changed the target to 100 million new treatments by the end of 2021 .\nBy June 2021 , the therapeutics team had allocated only about 1.8 million treatments .\nPerhaps most egregiously , these organizations , led by the Gates Foundation , supported massive profits for Big Pharma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intellectual property waiver for the COVID vaccine , which many falsely believed would be a silver bullet for COVID .\nThis prevented low-and-middle income countries from developing generic versions of the vaccine and guaranteed massive profits for Big Pharma while thwarting wider access to the vaccines .\n( The Gates Foundation eventually reversed this position , but it was too little too late . )\nRemember that COVID vaccines were developed with substantial taxpayer investment through Operation Warp Speed .\nThe experimental mRNA technology used in most COVID vaccines is the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense .\nBut , as is often the case , Big Pharma was given a monopoly over this experimental technology , and thanks to scare tactics and coercion leading billions of people around the world to get the COVID vaccine , they \u2019 ve made a mint : Pfizer recorded $ 7.8 billion in revenue in 2021 from its COVID vaccine .\nANH has written before about our many concerns regarding the adverse health effects that can result as a result of these shots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective alternatives to treating and preventing COVID .\nIf even a fraction of the money that had been spent on developing and distributing vaccines had gone into researching or informing the public about common-sense strategies like nasal hygiene , vitamin D status , or the use of hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin , much suffering could have been avoided .\nAnd that \u2019 s the point .\nWhen decisions are democratic , lots of voices and approaches can be discussed , negotiated , and melded together .\nInstead , a small circle of decision-makers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shots .\nThese are concerning developments for the next pandemic .\nThese organizations clearly wield an incredible amount of power and influence , but they are not accountable to any democratic checks and balances .\nIt is additionally concerning that this power and influence is wielded in a way that protects Big Pharma

the nutrients delivered by Centrum are rather paltry : there \u2019 s only 60 mg of vitamin C ; 3 mg of vitamin B6 ; 50 mg of magnesium ; and 19 mcg of selenium .\nBetter products will deliver many times more nutrients than this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C , 37 mg of B6 , 200 mg magnesium , and 100 mcg of selenium .\nCentrum also uses suboptimal versions of magnesium and vitamin A , in addition to vitamin E

if the food contained GMO ingredients .\nNow , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code alone is not an adequate GMO disclosure , and will need to be accompanied by a disclosure option accessible to all Americans .\nSignificant problems remain , but this is an important victory .\nAs pointed out by Alan Lewis of Natural Grocers , one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit : \u201c The rest of the ruling simply restated what the biotech juggernaut has spent hundreds of millions of dollars lobbying Congress and regulators for since the 1970s : the Right to Obfuscate.\n\u201d ( Check out ANH \u2019 s interview

\u201d and disallowing \u201c GE \u201d or \u201c GMO \u201d with which most consumers are familiar .\nThe court also ruled that USDA may continue excluding \u201c highly refined \u201d products from

bright side , some think that other developments have the potential to make real food transparency a reality .\nThis has to do with Environmental , Social , and Governance ( ESG ) reporting .\nJust as

dose not found in FDA-approved drugs , or a time-released version , different combinations of T3 and T4 , etc .\nIt \u2019 s hardly surprising , then , that studies have found many , many patients prefer natural thyroid to synthetic options .\nIn order to be made into a customized medicine , a substance has to meet one of three criteria .\nIt must either : \u2022 appear on an FDA pre-approved list ( the Bulk Drug list ) ; \u2022 be a component of an approved drug .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what \u2019 s the problem ?\nThe FDA is now claiming that NDT meets the definition of a \u201c biologic \u201d ( medications that come from living sources , like vaccines , monoclonal antibodies , etc . )\nbecause it contains thyroglobulin , an amino acid found in the pig glands used to make NDT .\nBiologics are not able to be compounded unless there is an approved biological license application ( BLA ) , which is akin to a new drug application requiring clinical trials .\nThe FDA is using a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacked for years .\nThis is , of course , absurd .\nClinical trials can not be conducted on compounded medicines given the highly varied and individualized doses and delivery mechanisms used .\nAs explained above , this is the whole point behind compounded medicine , to customize medicines to meet individual patients \u2019 needs .\nWith this move , the FDA is in effect banning compounded NDT .\nWhat remains to be seen is how swiftly the agency will move to enforce this position .\nWe will return to this in subsequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a years-long FDA campaign against natural thyroid .\nThis stems from the fact that natural thyroid competes with Big Pharma \u2019 s FDA-approved T4 thyroid drugs , which include Levothyroxine and Synthroid .\nThe market size of Levothyroxine alone is $ 2.3 billion , expected to grow to $ 3.5 billion by 2027 .\nIn a list of the top 300 most prescribed drugs of 2020 , Levothyroxine was listed at number two with over 20 million patients and just under 99 million prescriptions .\nFor many years , Synthroid was the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thyroid , and the compounding pharmacies that produce it , therefore represent an annoyance to the government-sponsored monopolists running Big Pharma .\nAs we \u2019 ve seen with the FDA \u2019 s campaign against other compounded bioidentical hormones , the agency also has an innate distrust of anything not FDA-approved .\nThe FDA claims that these medicines , having not gone through FDA approval , can not be guaranteed to be safe or effective , nor can hormone levels be guaranteed from batch to batch .\nWe believe this is all a smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years without any apparent safety issues .\nThe FDA simply doesn \u2019 t like that it doesn \u2019 t have authority over natural thyroid and that there is significant competition for Big Pharma \u2019 s synthetic drugs .\nThe Alliance for Pharmacy Compounding , a trade group for compounding pharmacists , is holding a town hall event on this issue on October 13 , 2022 .\nPharmacists and consumers interested in learning more are welcome to attend .\nThis is also concerning given the separate process by which the FDA is deciding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estradiol can continue to be compounded .\nThis action is further proof that the FDA wants to see these hormones disappear .\nWe can \u2019 t let that happen .\nIn the big picture , this is a direct threat to the very future of traditional compounding pharmacies .\nIf they can \u2019 t make thyroid medications , or estriol , or estradiol , or progesterone , or curcumin , or many of the other natural medicines the FDA is attempting to ban from compounding , these pharmacies will go out of business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the FDA \u2019 s goal .\nTime and time again in the agency \u2019 s communications on compounding , the FDA bemoans the lack of clinical trials that would attest to the safety and efficacy of compounded medicines\u2014the standard used to approve new drugs .\nBut legally compounded drugs are exempted from new drug approval requirements .\nWhat the agency is really saying is that it does not want compounded drugs to exist , period , because the agency doesn \u2019 t control them and they compete with Big Pharma \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the FDA wipe out traditional compounding pharmacies .\nAction Alert !\nWrite to Congress and the FDA , telling them to retain consumer access to compounded natural thyroid medications .\nPlease send your message immediately .", "author": "ANH-USA", "url":

it actively suppresses the dissemination of this information .\nWe saw this in stark relief during COVID as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ censorship campaign targeting doctors and clinics that informed the public about natural medicines that could plausibly help with COVID .\nPerhaps even more egregiously , the FDA recently blocked a qualified health claim for magnesium \u2019 s ability to help with

improvements , it shows that the federal government continues to get it wrong on nutrition .\nAction Alert !\nUnder the old definition , processed yogurt packed with sugar could be called \u201c healthy , \u201d but salmon , eggs , and water could not !\nThe updated proposal corrects some of these absurdities but also reflects the government \u2019 s misguided , outdated , and ultimately incorrect nutrition advice .\nThis demonstrates that the government shouldn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is healthy in the first place , because they are not equipped to do so , and they are too susceptible to corporate influence that prioritizes the profits of special interests over public health .\nThe current definition was set in 1994 and allows food manufacturers to add the word \u201c healthy \u201d to their products as long as the products do not exceed certain limits for total fat , saturated fat , cholesterol , and sodium and provide 10 percent of the daily value of certain nutrients ( vitamins A and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or dietary fiber ) .\nUsing these criteria , sugary cereals and yogurts aimed at children could be considered \u201c healthy \u201d while foods widely regarded as healthy but high in fat ( like salmon and avocados ) were ineligible to use that distinction .\nUnder the new definition , a \u201c healthy \u201d food would need to contain a minimum amount of one of several food groups ( vegetables , fruits , grains , dairy , protein , or certain oils ) and be under proposed limits for saturated fats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruits and vegetables would automatically qualify as healthy .\nThese limits can vary depending on the food .\nMany sugary cereals , highly sweetened yogurts , and white breads that may currently qualify as \u201c healthy \u201d would be removed under the proposed definition , and salmon would be added to the \u201c healthy \u201d category .\nIt goes without saying that sugar-laden foods should not be identified as healthy , so including a limit for added sugar in the definition of \u201c healthy \u201d is a no-brainer .\nWe would argue that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far enough , as the government shouldn \u2019 t be condoning the consumption of any added sugar .\nThe proposed definition allows a maximum of 2.5 grams of added sugar for specific foods like \u00be cup of yogurt , for example , or 5 percent of the daily value for added sugar , and a \u201c healthy \u201d food must contain a certain amount of food from fruit , vegetables , grains , dairy , or protein .\nRemember , just a few years ago the FDA updated its Nutrition Facts Panel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added sugar should be 10 percent of total calories , or 50 grams of added sugar per day .\nAs we said at the time , to imply that we need any amount of added sugar is false and misleading due to the myriad negative health effects associated with sugar consumption .\nEven though foods like salmon could be labeled as \u201c healthy \u201d under the proposed definition , the government is still wrong about saturated fat .\nThe new definition places strict limits on saturated fats to less than 10 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans which continues to propagate the debunked notion that we should be limiting saturated fats in our diet .\nWe \u2019 ve been criticizing the government \u2019 s advice on saturated fat for years .\nHistorically the claim has been an alleged link to heart disease .\nHowever , more recent evidence shows that saturated fat is not , in fact , linked to heart disease .\nRather saturated fat has been proven to have a number of health benefits , including improved cardiovascular risk factors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lungs and brain , proper nerve signaling , and a strong immune system .\nSome saturated fats , such as coconut oil , are considered superfoods .\nWhile we \u2019 re on the topic , the government is also wrong about the need to limit cholesterol because we now know that eating foods that are rich in cholesterol doesn \u2019 t increase your cholesterol levels .\nIn fact , eating a diet high in carbohydrates is the primary factor for high cholesterol levels .\nWe also have to look at why the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it isn \u2019 t simply ignorance .\nThe development of dietary guidelines is a crony feast , with Big Food companies spending millions to lobby Congress to influence the guidelines in their favor .\nThis has been going on for years .\nIn 1991 , the USDA halted publication of its Food Pyramid due to pushback from the meat and dairy lobbying groups that objected to how their products were displayed in the pyramid .\nThe Food Pyramid was released a year later after industry concerns were appeased .\nIn the most recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower added sugar and alcohol consumption contained in a scientific advisory report were not carried forward into the final guidelines after heavy lobbying from those industries .\nWhen public

Unvaccinated Children Healthier?", "content": "A re-examination of an unfairly retracted study casts doubt on the official narrative that vaccines are safe and effective for all children .\nWe \u2019 ve all heard the mantras recited faithfully by government health bureaucrats , the agencies they work for , and the medical associations tied into the conventional medical system : vaccines are safe and effective , and there is no evidence that they cause adverse effects in significant numbers .\nBecause these messages are coming from people in positions of authority , many in the public believe that such assertions are backed by credible science .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ examines data on the need for doctors \u2019 visits for unvaccinated versus vaccinated children .\nThey found that vaccination increased the need for visits to the doctor for vaccine-related health outcomes , meaning vaccinated children suffer from far more chronic illness than those who are unvaccinated .\nBefore we say more about the study , it is necessary to explain its origins because that story speaks to the difficulty in pinning down the truth about vaccine safety .\nThe original data set was published in a peer-reviewed journal in 2020 .\nThis was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pediatric practice of Dr. Paul Thomas , an Oregon physician .\nThe study found that unvaccinated children had fewer doctors \u2019 visits and diagnoses of chronic disease than vaccinated children , suggesting that unvaccinated children have fewer health problems than those who are vaccinated .\nFive days after the study was published , Dr. Thomas \u2019 license was suspended .\nA month later , the study was retracted , reportedly because an anonymous reader expressed concerns about the study , arguing that the reason unvaccinated children appeared to have fewer visits was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t showing up to well visits , so there was no opportunity for a diagnosis , thus skewing the results .\nThis wasn \u2019 t based on data ; it was an unsubstantiated opinion .\nIt was , apparently , enough for the journal to retract the study , though .\nThis type of capitulation shouldn \u2019 t shock us .\nMedical journals rely on compensation from pro-vaccine government agencies and ( often pharmaceutical ) advertisers for financial support .\nAs such , there is tremendous pressure either not to publish studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or to retract them at the first sign of pushback .\nLook at what happened to Dr. Andrew Wakefield for merely suggesting more study of the possible link between the MMR vaccine and autism .\nIt takes no small amount of bravery even to study the subject of vaccine safety , a subject for which there is frighteningly scant research for the obvious reasons\u2014that is , journals won \u2019 t publish it , and as a researcher or physician you \u2019 re putting your reputation and medical license in jeopardy .\nGovernment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , insist on the \u201c gold-standard \u201d of research , the placebo-controlled , randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) .\nYet long-term RCTs on vaccine safety haven \u2019 t been done due to the perceived unethical nature of conducting a trial in which some children do not receive the claimed benefits of vaccination .\nIn fact , as the Institute of Medicine ( now known as the National Academies of Sciences , Engineering , and Medicine ) acknowledged in a 2013 review , \u201c No studies have compared the differences in health outcomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fully immunized children.\n\u201d As the new study \u2019 s authors point out , even the studies held up by government health authorities as proof positive of vaccine safety do not universally support that narrative : The accuracy of claims published on the CDC website , such as \u201c Vaccines Do Not Cause Autism \u201d , are impossible to assess because the question of association has not been addressed for most of the pediatric vaccines in the CDC schedule , nor have the interactions between them been systematically addressed .\nLikewise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a \u201c lack of a mechanism \u201d to explain such a link .\nHence , there is a pressing need for brave researchers to ask important questions about vaccine safety .\nWhich brings us to the new study .\nAuthors James Lyons-Weiler , Ph.D. , and Dr. Russell Blaylock looked at the original data to see if the anonymous reader \u2019 s assertion was correct , that unvaccinated children only appeared healthier because they simply did not go visit the doctor .\nTheir results demonstrated the opposite : unvaccinated pediatric patients kept their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequency than vaccinated patients .\nFurther , the analysis confirmed the original study \u2019 s findings that vaccinated pediatric patients have a higher disease burden .\nWe at ANH have always been clear about our position on vaccines .\nWe are not anti-vaccine .\nWe support everybody \u2019 s right to choose what is best for themselves and/or their families .\nWe should be able to ask questions and let the science guide us .\nWhen those answers are inconvenient , that is even more reason for them to be published and discussed @ @ @ @", "author": "TIM REIHM",

prevailing strain of the virus will be and create a flu shot that protects against that strain .\nThis is a difficult task , as evidenced by the sub-par efficacy of flu vaccines over the years : since the 2014-15 flu season , flu vaccine efficacy has not gone above 50 percent .\nSince the 2009-10 flu season , flu vaccine efficacy has averaged 42 percent .\nWe at ANH-USA have been beating the drum

of respiratory infections ( cold and flu ) by 10 percent overall\u2014and there are reasons to think this figure greatly understates the degree of protection .\nThe protective effect of vitamin D was even more dramatic in those who were deficient .\nFor the deficient , which about 40 % of Americans are , the risk of infection was reduced by half with vitamin D supplementation .\nNote that over 90 percent of Americans have insufficient vitamin D. This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese study which found that vitamin D supplementation was as effective as the vaccine at preventing colds and flu .\nThere \u2019 s reason to believe that vitamin D is even more protective than these numbers suggest .\n\u201c Deficiency \u201d and \u201c insufficiency \u201d for vitamin D are based on levels determined by the National Academies of Sciences , Engineering , and Medicine ( NASEM ) .\nThis body of \u201c experts \u201d recommends that individuals aged 1-70 get 600 IU ( 15mcg ) of vitamin D per day to achieve \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least 20 ng/mL .\nIntegrative health experts will tell you that these levels are simply ridiculous .\nThey recommend achieving circulating blood levels as high as 80 ng/mL vitamin D. This means that the study mentioned above shows that those who are deficient in vitamin D\u2014likely most Americans , given how wrong NASEM is about how much vitamin D we really need\u2014can reduce their risk of cold or flu by 50 percent .\nThat is more effective than the flu vaccine usually is , and without the list of possible side effects such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat , fatigue , muscle pains ,

you \u2019 re buying truly \u201c raw \u201d ?\nRaw almonds contain a bevy of important micronutrients that support health .\nThey support heart health , gut health , fight inflammation , reduce insulin resistance , and help with weight control .\nIt \u2019 s relatively well-known that roasting almonds reduces their nutrient content , which is why many health-conscious consumers opt for raw almonds .\nThe problem is , if you \u2019 re buying your almonds from a store , it \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c raw , \u201d even if it says so on the package .\nTo get real raw almonds , the only way to do so is directly from a grower .\nBy law , almonds have to be pasteurized .\nThis arose in response to outbreaks of Salmonella in 2001 and 2004 traced to raw almonds grown in California that sickened 33 people ; no one died .\nAs a result , the Almond Board of California and the USDA created a mandatory program in 2007 requiring all almonds to be sterilized through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemical treatment with propylene oxide ( PPO ) , oil or dry roasting , blanching , or steam .\nNote that organic regulations prohibit the use of PPO .\nIrradiation was used for a number of years , but the Almond Board now says that almond pasteurization does not include irradiation .\nOil roasting , dry roasting , and blanching cook the nuts , so it is absurd that they are still able to be labeled as raw .\nSteam also heats the almonds to 200 degrees Fahrenheit , negatively affecting its nutrition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live enzymes that help your body digest , sparing the pancreas the work of making those digestive enzymes .\nHeating the almonds also oxidizes the omega-3 fatty acids in the almonds , potentially turning them rancid and producing free radicals , which contribute to inflammation and all

steamed or treated with PPO , so consumers are misled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw almonds when , in fact , they are not .\nLabeling is an absolute necessity for consumers to make an informed choice .\nWhen the rule was instituted , raw and organic almond farmers were outraged and pushed back .\nThey fought the USDA , and in 2010 a federal appeals court ruled they could challenge USDA \u2019 s almond

most refineries are located in the Midwest in states like Nebraska , Minnesota , Iowa , Indiana , Illinois , and Kansas .\nEthanol plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-starch grains like corn ; the byproduct from ethanol production , known as distillers mash , is sold as livestock feed .\nBut AltEn did things a bit differently .\nFor decades , the company collected leftover seeds from around the country that were coated with pesticides .\nAltEn even advertised itself as a \u201c recycling \u201d location where seed companies could offload their excess pesticide-treated seeds .\nThis gave them a free supply for their ethanol production , but the byproduct from the chemical-treated seeds was too toxic to sell as animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lime-green mash of fermented seeds in huge lagoons and distributed some to local farmers to apply to their land .\nFor years , AltEn also left an 84,000-ton pile of fermented seed waste in an unlined waste pit , allowing water-soluble noenicitinoids to seep into soil and reach groundwater ; when it rained , runoff from this pile would contaminate local waterways , and during dry spells , toxic dust could carry contaminants off the pile and through

video of butterflies and birds in the area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2021 , state regulators closed down AltEn \u2019 s plant and are currently suing the company for violating state environmental laws dealing with how solid waste , like the seed sludge , was being stored , how wastewater discharges from the seed \u201c lagoons \u201d were improperly managed , and for pollution of waterways without a permit , among other violations cited by the lawsuit .\nBut that was just the beginning .\nJust days after the shutdown , a frozen pipe ruptured at the plant and sent 4 million gallons of wastewater @ @ @ @

farming strategies that foster beneficial , predatory insects can be more effective than pesticides at pest management .\nIn fact , a 2015 study found that the use of coated soybeans actually reduced crop yields by poisoning the predators that kill slugs , which can cause extensive damage to corn and soy fields .\nAnd the supposed benefit of not having to spray as many pesticides during the growing season is offset by the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their seeds are treated with insecticides .\nSeed treatment also increases the proportion of pesticides that enter soil and groundwater : from 90 to 99 percent of the active ingredient in a seed coating is lost to air , soil , and water .\nOver 150 million acres of farmland are planted with chemically-treated seeds , including nearly four tons of neonicotinoids .\nAlmost every corn and cotton seed planted in the US is coated in pesticides , about half of soybean seeds .\nThis tool allows you to see where pesticides @ @ @ @ @ @ @

includes adding nominated substances to one of three categories : those nominated with sufficient supporting information ; nominated substances that pose \u201c significant safety risks \u201d ; and

due to medical providers inadvertently interchanging edetate disodium with edetate calcium disodium.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banned because some doctors have made mistakes .\nReally ?\nThe FDA also states , seemingly as an afterthought , that there are safety concerns when EDTA is used for indications other than those approved by the FDA , which is the treatment of lead poisoning .\nNote that this action does not currently affect traditional pharmacy compounding of EDTA .\nOur concern is that the FDA will eventually move against all forms of compounded EDTA by adding it to the \u201c Difficult to Compound \u201d List for traditional pharmacies \u2019 , alongside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerns as justification .\nAnd if that happens , access to EDTA will be lost , as the FDA-approved EDTA products are discontinued or withdrawn .\nThat EDTA is a safety risk is not supported by the facts .\nResearch has demonstrated that chelation is both safe and beneficial .\nThe federally funded TACT ( Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy ) study , which included 1,708 patients across the US and Canada , showed that EDTA-chelation therapy reduced cardiovascular events in patients who were over 50 and had previously experienced a heart attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double-blind study were even more profound for diabetic patients , who experienced a 43 % reduction in death from any cause over five years

in TACT shows that this therapy is extremely safe when used according to the TACT safe infusion protocol.\n\u201d Chelation is used by integrative physicians to remove heavy metals like lead , cadmium , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can clear up many , many health conditions and prevent worse ones from developing .\nThe process involves injecting patients with organic chemicals\u2014such as EDTA , which is typically compounded\u2014that bind and remove the heavy metals present in the bloodstream .\nIn IV chelation , mineral and nutrient IVs are typically added to support the body during the detoxification process .\nEDTA is also available in other forms , such as suppositories .\nThink of your body as a bathtub , slowly being filled with environmental contaminants that we are constantly exposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your tomatoes , the arsenic in your rice , the BPA in your plastic food wrap , or mercury in the fish you eat , or the amalgam your dentist uses .\nIf your \u201c bathtub

pandemic brought censorship and suppression of scientific debate to frightening new heights .\nSuppression of unwelcome or unwanted views is nothing new , but there are several indications that the censorship that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic took on a new character .\nA new study aims to shed light on the features of this censorship , and it hits on many of the themes we \u2019 ve been reporting on for some time .\nEfforts to stifle free speech are culminating in state-level bills that threaten doctors \u2019 medical licenses if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pandemic .\nWe can not allow these efforts to stifle the speech of doctors to succeed .\nAn \u201d orthodox \u201d position on key issues of the pandemic has coalesced .\nBroadly speaking , this position is in favor of mask mandates and lockdowns , against the use of re-purposed drugs like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin for early treatment of mild- to moderate COVID , supports COVID vaccines as unequivocally safe and effective , and supports COVID vaccine mandates and vaccine passports as ethical measures to protect public health .\nAnyone calling any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a target for censorship and suppression carried out by government , tech companies like Facebook , Google , and Twitter , and special interests like pharmaceutical companies .\nSometimes this censorship was a coordinated effort .\nFor example , on March 7 , 2022 , the US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called on tech companies to report \u201c health misinformation \u201d to the federal government and to ramp up efforts to remove it .\nEmails released from legal proceedings have documented the ways in which government officials coordinated with Big Tech to censor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The newly published study mentioned above documents the tactics used by the censors that , for many of us , have become all too familiar .\nThose who take a dissenting view from the orthodox positions are excluded , for example , from contributing to or making appearances on media outlets where they were previously welcome guests\u2014they stop getting interviewed or getting opinion pieces accepted .\nDerogatory labeling is another tactic : those who don \u2019 t toe the orthodox line are labeled \u201d anti-vaxxers , \u201d \u201c COVID deniers , \u201d or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be neutral or non-partisan ( like the \u201c fact checkers \u201d ) are used by the media to further discredit the heterodox positions taken by some scientists and doctors .\nThe study \u2019 s authors note key differences in this current wave of censorship that set it apart from previous examples : \u2022 Intensiveness and extensiveness .\nRegarding COVID , not only did the government , media , and Big Tech engage in censorship ; medical and research institutions and scientific journals also took an active role in suppressing and discouraging alternative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; institutions threatened not to renew contracts if dissenters mentioned their affiliation with that institution ; if you took the wrong position on COVID issues , you could be dismissed or disqualified from prestigious positions on health or scientific committees , without due process or transparency ; and doctors \u2019 medical licenses were threatened if they took the wrong view on COVID-related topics .\n\u2022 Going outside the fringe .\nA unique and troubling aspect of the censorship wave we are experiencing is that highly respected and credentialed scientists and researchers have become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their respective fields with hundreds of publications , heads of academic and medical departments , and/or editors of medical journals .\nFor example , the Great Barrington Declaration , which criticized government lockdown policies , was created by three epidemiologists from Harvard , Stanford , and Oxford universities and signed by many notable scientists , including the Nobel Prize laureate Michael Levitt ; Google altered its search algorithm to reduce exposure to the Declaration .\nThese aren \u2019 t cooks on the fringe whose work and views are being suppressed , de-platformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no one is safe from the censorship brigade .\nThe wave of censorship is likely to continue .\nCalifornia just passed a law that makes it easier for the state medical board to target doctors who disseminate \u201c misinformation \u201d related to COVID ; other states have introduced similar legislation .\nThe CEO of the Federation of State Medical Boards said that \u201c the largest threat next to the spread of the virus itself is the spread of disinformation and misinformation.\n\u201d The FSMB recommends that state boards should \u201c consider whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disciplinary action that could help a licensee understand the ethical basis of their duty to convey accurate information to patients and the public.\n\u201d This is eerily reminiscent of authoritarian \u201c re-education \u201d camps for doctors .\nA group called No License for Disinformation has put up a webpage containing \u201c everything you need to report a doctor for COVID-19 related disinformation.\n\u201d The free-speech stifling effects of this censorship would be bad enough , but it also costs lives .\nDr. Peter McCullough , one of the victims of this censorship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out forcefully and convincingly about the failure of public health officials during the pandemic that has cost hundreds of thousands of lives .\nWhile the government was telling us to isolate and wash our hands , he was figuring out how to treat patients with combinations of re-purposed drugs ; Studies that utilized this approach showed an 85 percent reduction in mortality .\nHow many lives could have been saved if the media , government , and Big Tech were more concerned with the science and less concerned with censorship and suppression ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the one-size-fits-all paradigm .\nNatural medicine is predicated on the idea that each patient has individual needs based on unique biology and genetics .\nIf doctors aren \u2019 t allowed to discuss alternatives to the mainstream medical approach , not only are the legal requirements of informed consent not being satisfied , but integrative doctors \u2019 ability to treat individual patients will suffer .", "author": "ANH-USA", "url":

problems that make it difficult to live a normal , healthy life .\nHere \u2019 s how to get to the root cause and restore balance .\nDo your mood and energy fluctuate wildly ?\nDo you crave sugar or salt ?\nAre you depressed ?\nSleep poorly ?\nOverweight and putting on more and more fat ?\nDo you have dry skin and hair loss ?\nBrain fog ?\nIntolerance to cold ?\nConstipation ?\nIf you \u2019 re a woman , do you suffer from irregular , painful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer to any of these questions is \u201c yes , \u201d it could be an indication that your hormones are out of balance , and you wouldn \u2019 t be alone .\nHalf of women have reported experiencing the symptoms of hormone imbalance .\nOne of every 10 people in the US have thyroid conditions .\nAs with many other health conditions , the conventional medical paradigm treats the symptoms of hormonal imbalances without addressing the real cause of imbalance in the first place .\nPart one of our coverage of this topic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions ; part two will cover sex hormones and adrenal function .\nThe endocrine system is responsible for regulating bodily functions through the release of hormones , messenger molecules that travel through the bloodstream that tell various organs and tissue what to do and how to function .\nThere are several hormone-secreting glands and organs that comprise the endocrine system , including the hypothalamus and the pineal gland in the brain , the pituitary gland , the thyroid and parathyroid , the pancreas , the adrenal gland , and the thymus .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crucial bodily systems , including metabolism , growth and development , sexual function , heart rate , blood pressure , appetite , and sleeping and waking cycles , to name a few .\nWhen this delicate balance of hormones is dysregulated , many health problems can arise .\nThe most common hormone disorder is insulin resistance ; 40 percent of adults ages 18-44 have insulin resistance ; 96 million Americans have prediabetes , which is caused by insulin resistance .\nWhen you eat too much sugar , flour , or white rice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your cells become resistant to insulin \u2019 s effects .\nThis creates a vicious cycle : you pump out more and more insulin but become more and more resistant to its effects .\nInsulin resistance can cause energy and mood swings and can lead to chronic conditions like high blood pressure , heart disease , obesity , dementia , and more .\nIt can also lead to prediabetes or diabetes\u2014when the body doesn \u2019 t make enough insulin to manage blood glucose levels .\nWe \u2019 ve also reported on research demonstrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood sugar control by impairing insulin sensitivity and decreasing insulin production .\nThis research shows that exposure to environmental pollutants is the primary culprit behind the diabetes epidemic .\nYou can reverse insulin resistance with diet and lifestyle modifications .\nEssentially , reduce the amount of processed foods , baked goods , pasta , flour , sugar , sodas , etc .\nfrom your diet , replacing them with healthy fats ( fish oil , olive oil , nuts and seeds , avocados ) , healthy protein ( nuts , seeds , beans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . )\nand healthy sources of carbs ( vegetables , fruits , whole grains ) .\nReducing exposure to environmental contaminants is also a must ( see our earlier Health from the Ground Up articles on sources of toxins , how to avoid them , and support detoxification ) .\nThyroid conditions are also incredibly common .\nAlmost 30 million Americans are estimated to have a thyroid condition , and about 5 million Americans just haven \u2019 t been diagnosed and are not aware they have a thyroid condition .\nOne woman in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lifetime .\nSo will many men .\nOne of the most common thyroid disorders is hypothyroidism , where the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone , causing symptoms such as extreme fatigue , depression , weight gain , and forgetfulness .\nHypothyroidism can be caused by many factors .\nThe most common is autoimmunity , which accounts for 90 percent of hypothyroidism in adults .\nHashimoto \u2019 s disease affects five out of every 100 people in the US , and 8 times more women than men .\nWith this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thyroid as a foreign pathogen and produces antibodies to attack it , disrupting the thyroid \u2019 s ability to produce enough hormones .\nThe hormones produced by the thyroid are involved in the regulation of your metabolism as well as your endocrine , cardiovascular , neurological , and immune function , so not having enough can have serious and wide-ranging effects .\nFood intolerances can also be implicated in thyroid conditions , particularly gluten sensitivity .\nThis is because the structure of gliadin , the protein in gluten , resembles the structure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitive to gluten and you eat it , your immune system will attack the gliadin and your thyroid gland .\nBetween 1-5 percent of Americans have Celiac disease , but it often goes undiagnosed because people do not have obvious symptoms .\nGut health is connected to nearly every major aspect of health , and thyroid function is no exception .\nGut dysbiosis may negatively impact thyroid metabolism .\nLeaky gut , when the gut lining is damaged and allows undigested food molecules to enter the bloodstream , causes sustained inflammation because your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substances in your blood .\nAn overstressed immune system can lead to autoimmunity as your own cells get caught in the crossfire during these states of sustained inflammation .\n( See our previous overview of gut health for more information on supporting a healthy gut . )\nSpecific nutrient deficiencies can also impair thyroid function , particularly iodine , zinc , and selenium .\nChronic stress also negatively impacts the thyroid ; stress releases inflammatory cytokines that end up reducing thyroid function .\nAddressing hypothyroidism often requires medicine\u2014we went over this in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent attack on natural desiccated thyroid medicines , which are superior to FDA-approved synthetic thyroid medicines .\nThe causes described above indicate diet and lifestyle modifications that can be made , including : going off of gluten , eating an anti-inflammatory diet , supplementing with selenium and zinc , managing stress , and practicing good sleep habits , to name a few .\nSupplementing with iodine is recommended by some doctors but is controversial .\nAs always , please consult an integrative healthcare provider to determine the best treatment plan .\nLess common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much thyroid hormone .\nThis causes energy metabolism to speed up , using energy more quickly .\nHyperthyroidism can make your heart beat faster , cause you to lose weight without trying , and make you feel nervous .\nGraves \u2019 disease , an autoimmune condition , is a common cause of hyperthyroidism .\nConventional treatments for hyperthyroidism include drugs like Propylthiouracil and Methamazole that come with a host of dangerous side effects , radioactive iodine to destroy thyroid gland cells that make you dependent on taking thyroid hormone medications for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removal of part of the thyroid gland .\nAs in many other disease conditions , these conventional treatments do not address the underlying causes of hyperthyroidism , which in many cases is autoimmunity .\nGut health , leaky gut , as discussed above with hypothyroidism , are key contributors to the inflammation that leads to autoimmunity .\nMercury and heavy metal exposure can also be a factor ; these metals damage cells , causing the immune system to attack these cells and other organs .\nStudies have found that those with higher mercury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thyroid disease .\nInfections like herpes and Epstein-Barr can also trigger autoimmune diseases that impair thyroid function .\nAn integrative approach to address hyperthyroidism is similar to hypothyroidism protocols : heal the gut , in many cases by removing gluten from the diet , test for heavy metals and other toxic exposures , test for infections like herpes and Epstein-Barr , and take immune-supporting supplements like vitamin D , fish oil , and glutathione .\nInsulin resistance and thyroid problems do not have to confine you to a lifetime of medication ; working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find and address the root causes of hormonal imbalances to help you regain your health .\nIn part two of this article , we will look at sex and stress hormones .\nPrevious articles from ANH \u2019 s Health from the Ground Up series : # 5 : The Hidden Cause of Fatigue", "author": "ANH-USA", "url":

"title": "Big Pharma Buying Up Supplement Companies", "content": "Major shifts are , and have been , occurring in the supplement industry .\nHere \u2019 s how they could affect your access .\nOver the last few decades , mega-corporations have been increasingly investing in the supplement sector\u2014especially during the last few years , which has seen a boom in mergers and acquisitions .\nSince 2017 , over $ 20 billion has been invested in supplement companies by the likes of Bayer , Nestle , Unilever , Proctor & Gamble , and Clorox .\nMergers and acquisitions in the supplement sector have surged : in 2018 , there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were 137 .\nIt \u2019 s no secret why large corporations are moving in\u2014the supplement market grew from $ 28 billion in 2010 to almost $ 60 billion in 2021 .\nThe bottom line is that many supplement brands you see on store shelves are owned by large corporations that traditionally do not deal in supplements .\nThe question is , what does this mean for our access to quality products that support our health ?\nFirst , what is a quality supplement ?\nThe quality of ingredients is the first marker of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not provide the right forms of bioavailable vitamins .\nThey provide vitamin A as beta carotene instead of broad-spectrum carotenoids ; vitamin E as synthetic dl-alpha tocopherol acetate instead of mixed tocopherols and tocotrienols ; folic acid instead of folate ; magnesium oxide rather than magnesium glycinate , taurate , malate , or chloride ; ubiquinol instead of CoQ10 .\nThey can contain other ingredients like additives and fillers that some consumers will want to avoid .\nNot only are the ingredients of lower quality , they are less potent .\nPfizer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , provides only 60 mg of vitamin C , 3 mg of vitamin B6 , 50 mg of magnesium , and 19 mcg of selenium .\nHigher quality supplement brands sell products with higher nutrient levels .\nInstead of 60 mg of vitamin C , some brands have 500 mg , and over 30 mg of vitamin B6 instead of just 3 mg. Companies investing in the supplement space are almost universally known for their products in other industries .\nBayer is a pharmaceutical and biotech company\u2014you may remember that they acquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unilever is known for beauty and personal care products like Dove and Axe body spray .\nNestle is a food company known for chocolate and sweets .\nProctor & Gamble owns brands like Tide , Downy , Charmin , Head & Shoulders , Crest , and many , many more .\nNestle Health Science , a division of Nestle , bought Pure Encapsulations and Douglas Foods , along with a host of other supplement companies , including Garden of Life , Vital Proteins , Nuun , Wobenzym , Persona Nutrition , Genestra , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Athlete and Bountiful .\nBountiful itself owns Solgar , Osteo Bi-Flex , Puritan \u2019 s Pride , Ester-C and Sundown , which are now all under Nestle \u2019 s control .\nOtsuka , a pharmaceutical company , owns MegaFood and Innate Therapeutics ; Schwabe , another pharmaceutical company , owns Integrative Therapeutics , Nature \u2019 s Way , and Enzymatic Therapy .\nUnilever owns Onnit , OLLY , Equilibra and Liquid I.V.\n, and SmartyPants Vitamins .\nWall Street is also getting in on the action , with private equity groups purchasing brands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these brands are not the high-quality supplements sought after by savvy natural health consumers .\nOLLY , bought by Uniliver , produces gummies that contain added sugar and additional added ingredients like natural flavors .\nNuun , a vitamin and hydration company , uses inferior forms of vitamins ( folic acid and magnesium oxide ) in their products .\nSmartyPants Vitamins is another company specializing in gummies that includes 7 grams of added sugar per serving .\nWe also know that Nestle is developing its own line of enteral nutrition products .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency due to cystic fibrosis , chronic pancreatitis and other conditions .\nSeveral of these brands are higher quality supplement companies , such as Pure Encapsulations , Douglas Laboratories , MegaFood , and Metagenics .\nWhat will happen to them now that they are owned by mega-corporations that have not historically had core natural health principles as the foundation of their businesses ?\nWe \u2019 ve spoken to several of the largest and highest quality brands that have not been purchased ; they have confirmed that larger companies have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here is a more detailed account of who owns what in the supplement space : Suffice it to say , mega-corporations are increasingly expanding into the supplement space , probably because , aside from the reasons already mentioned , the supplement market is enormous and continues to grow .\nIn 2021 , the US supplement market was worth $ 48.4 billion , and it is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 8.9 percent .\nWhere there \u2019 s money to be made , big players will want to cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean for supplement access going forward ?\nSen. Durbin \u2019 s Mandatory Product Listing for Supplements .\nWe \u2019 ve been writing for many months about Senator Dick Durbin \u2019 s ( D-IL ) efforts to require mandatory product listing for dietary supplements , and how this brings us closer to what the European Union is doing to restrict supplement dosages and formulas .\nRecall that the intention of EU law is to implement EU-wide , harmonized limits on maximum levels of vitamins and minerals in supplements .\nIndividual member countries have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mineral doses .\nThe infrastructure for doing the same thing is already in place in the US .\nAs we \u2019 ve seen in issues like GMO-labeling , where some states required labeling of GMO foods and others didn \u2019 t until federal law pre-empted state labeling laws , big companies don \u2019 t like dealing with a patchwork of regulations .\nMega-corporations doing business across the world would likely welcome harmonized levels of supplements so they can sell their products on the world market without having to change formulations or labels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they wouldn \u2019 t meet the \u201c harmonized \u201d nutrient levels , and all that would be left are the most basic , cookie-cutter products that don \u2019 t support patient needs but make the most money\u2014think of the supplements you see at CVS , or Walgreen \u2019 s , etc .\nSo , Nestle owning Douglas Labs and Pure Encapsulations may not mean any change in quality for now , but that could all change if Sen.

the same issues .\nWhat \u2019 s going on ?\nA recent article unpacked some of the reasons why Americans traveling in Europe are able to eat gluten abroad , but not in the US .\nExperts don \u2019 t know for sure , but possibilities include differences in the type of wheat used , a higher presence of chemicals in US foods , and lifestyle factors when you \u2019 re travelling .\nBetween 1-5 percent of Americans have Celiac disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people do not have obvious symptoms .\nCeliac disease is an autoimmune disease that causes damage to the small intestines when someone eats gluten .\nIt can lead to several serious health issues .\nA large study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that people with diagnosed , undiagnosed , and \u201c latent \u201d celiac disease or gluten sensitivity had a higher risk of death , mostly from heart disease and cancer .\nMany more Americans\u2014as many as 30\u201340 % of the US population , according to the research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field\u2014have gluten sensitivity ( also called Non-Celiac Gluten Intolerance ) , which means that they , too , are sickened by gluten .\nIt is also sometimes referred to as \u201c silent \u201d celiac disease , as the disease may remain latent for twenty years or more before becoming full-blown celiac disease if gluten consumption is continued .\nPeople with Celiac disease should not eat gluten , period .\nBut people who have gluten sensitivities in the US are sometimes able to eat gluten when travelling in Europe without any issues .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ different factors .\nFor one , gluten content varies depending on the type of wheat being used .\nWheat grown in the US is predominantly hard red wheat , which has a higher gluten content than the soft wheat grown in Europe .\nEurope has also banned many chemicals that are used in the US food supply such as : potassium bromate , red dye no .\n40 , yellow dyes no .\n5 and 6 , chlorine-washed poultry , rGBH or rBST growth hormones used in cows , genetically modified fruits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glyphosate , for example is used far more in the US than in Europe , and is even sprayed on wheat and other crops prior to harvest .\nOne study found that \u201c fish exposed to glyphosate develop digestive problems that are reminiscent of celiac disease.\n\u201d Other food additives that are used in the US but banned in Europe could be disrupting the gut microbiota and leading to digestive issues that do not present when eating food that is not as chock-full of chemicals .\nFinally , lifestyle factors could be contributing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On vacation , you are likely eating fewer processed foods and more fresh foods .\nIf you used to eat preservative-laden , factory-made bread at home , and then eat fresh-baked bread from a French bakery , you might digest the fresh bread better even if you have a gluten sensitivity .\nStress can also disrupt gut health , so a stress-relieving vacation could improve stress and digestion .\nYou \u2019 re also probably getting more exercise on vacation , which also aids digestion .\nThe staggering amount of chemicals in our food\u2014chemicals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a wakeup call .\nIn 2016 , US farmers used 322 million pounds of pesticides that are banned in the EU , 40 million pounds of pesticides banned or being phased out in China , and 26 million pounds of pesticides banned or being phased out in Brazil .\nIt \u2019 s not just food : the EU has banned or restricted 13,000 chemicals used in cosmetics ; the US has banned or restricted just 11 .\nIt \u2019 s hard to stay healthy , naturally , when we are bombarded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cookware , water , and air .\nThis speaks to the power of the chemical industry in influencing chemical

as a drug\u2014another gift to drug monopolists !\nAction Alert !\nThe FDA pulled a similar reversal a few years ago with vinpocetine , now it is happening again with \u03b2-NMN ( beta-nicotinamide mononucleotide , or simply NMN ) , an important supplement for mitochondrial health that can help address fatigue and other aspects of aging .\nWe must protect access to this important supplement .\nIf this decision stands , consumers lose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a number of documented benefits : it has been found to suppress age-associated weight gain , enhance energy metabolism and physical activity , improve insulin sensitivity , improve eye function , and improve mitochondrial health .\nSome of these benefits may be associated with the fact that NMN is a precursor to NAD+ , another crucial nutrient that is found in every cell in the body and is essential to life .\nIn fact , exposure to viruses like COVID have been found to deplete NAD+ levels , making supplements that boost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a batch of letters to supplement companies , the FDA communicated its position that NMN does not meet the definition of a supplement because it is being investigated as a drug .\nThis is the infamous \u201c back-channel \u201d at the FDA that allows the drug industry to monopolize natural ingredients .\nHere \u2019 s how it works .\nFor supplements that are considered \u201c new \u201d under the law\u2014that is , they weren \u2019 t sold \u201c in or as a supplement \u201d before 1994\u2014companies must submit a notification to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is safe before that ingredient can be marketed .\nThis is the deeply problematic \u201c new dietary ingredient \u201d ( NDI ) notification process that we have written about extensively over the years .\nBut here \u2019 s the issue : if a drug company files an Investigational new drug application ( IND ) and studies that ingredient before the FDA receives an NDI notification on it , it can no longer be sold as a supplement .\nThis creates a stacked deck in favor of Big Pharma monopolies .\nIND applications are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an IND on an ingredient and sit on it for 30 years .\nMeanwhile , an innovative supplement company could develop that nutrient into a great product , do the studies to comply with the FDA \u2019 s ridiculous notification process , and then create a market for that product\u2014and then the drug company can swoop in with their 30-year-old IND , kick the supplements out of the market , and create a monopoly .\nPart of the solution to this problem is to make IND \u2019 s public so the FDA and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rug out from under important supplements .\nThis isn \u2019 t hypothetical .\nIn 2016 , the FDA announced that vinpocetine , a brain health supplement which the agency had approved as a \u201c new \u201d supplement in the 1990s , couldn \u2019 t be a supplement anymore because a drug company had filed an IND on it in the 1980s .\nSomething similar happened to the pyridoxamine version of vitamin B6 in 2008 .\nA drug company had an IND and cleared the market of pyridoxamine supplements\u2014but then never even brought a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t matter\u2014the supplement version remains banned .\nIn 2018 , an executive of the company that wanted pyridoxamine supplements removed from the market petitioned for the FDA to allow pyridoxamine supplements to be sold\u2014to no avail .\nOnce gone due to this mechanism , the supplement is lost forever .\nWhat is especially outrageous about the FDA \u2019 s position is that the agency had previously acknowledged one \u201c new supplement \u201d notification on NMN\u2014the agency said nothing about the ingredient \u2019 s preclusion from being a supplement because it was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said when the FDA pulled a similar stunt in banning vinpocetine : it is absurd that the FDA can retroactively and unilaterally decide that a supplement is not a dietary ingredient , after it has already said that it is .\nWe argued at the time that such an action sets a dangerous precedent , and it looks like we were right .\nThe FDA did the same thing last year to NAC supplements : after years of allowing them on the market , even reviewing and accepting structure/function claims on them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t a legal dietary supplement .\nThe FDA \u2019 s announcement comes on the heels of a study claiming that nicotinamide riboside ( NR ) , a form of vitamin B3 , is linked to cancer .\nNR is another nutrient that has proven effective at raising NAD+ levels .\nThe study , like so many other studies claiming supplements are dangerous , suffers from a variety of shortcomings : it was an incredibly small mouse study that did not represent real world conditions\u2014mice were injected with highly aggressive cancer cells .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast cancer does not show that NR induces breast cancer .\nFurther , NR has been heavily studied in animals , and no link to cancer has been found .\nOur concern is that the FDA will use this study to attack NR supplements and further undercut our ability to naturally raise NAD+ levels to address fatigue , mitochondrial health , and more .\nThe crux of the problem is that the law allows drug companies to create monopolies on natural ingredients that have been sold in the marketplace for years .\nPart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our system gives priority to drugs : the FDA has , and continues to , distrust , attack , and undermine medicines that are not \u201c FDA-approved \u201d like supplements , homeopathic medicines , and compounded drugs .\nThere \u2019 s also a belief that drug research needs to be incentivized , since the costs of bringing a drug to market can reach into the billions .\nBut this ignores the fact that taxpayers heavily subsidize these costs : a recent analysis found that , of the drugs approved between 2010 and 2016 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or university labs funded by the government ( i.e .\ntaxpayers ) .\nGiving drug companies monopolies on natural compounds reduces consumer choice , drives up the cost of healthcare , and restricts access to products that could benefit public health .\nWe can \u2019 t let this most recent attempt to gift an important supplement as a monopoly to the drug industry succeed .\nAction Alert !\nWrite to Congress and the FDA , urging them to retain consumer access to NMN

when menstrual periods stop .\nMany women ( about 20 percent ) experience no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they approach menopause .\nBut the change in hormone levels associated with menopause , particularly the drop in estrogen levels , can cause a range of health effects : diminished sex drive , hot flashes , night sweats , vaginal dryness , sleep problems , weight gain , mood changes , memory loss , fatigue ,

and health span research can no longer be sold as a supplement because it is being studied as a drug\u2014another gift to drug monopolists !\nAction Alert !\nThe FDA pulled a similar reversal a few years ago with vinpocetine , now it is happening again with \u03b2-NMN ( beta-nicotinamide mononucleotide , or simply NMN ) , an important supplement for anti-aging .\nWe must protect access to this important supplement .\nIf this decision stands , consumers lose , and drug company monopolists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documented benefits : it has been found to suppress age-associated weight gain , enhance energy metabolism and physical activity , improve insulin sensitivity , improve eye function , and improve mitochondrial health .\nSome of these benefits may be associated with the fact that NMN is a precursor to NAD+ , another crucial nutrient that is found in every cell in the body and is essential to life .\nIn fact , exposure to viruses like COVID have been found to deplete NAD+ levels , making supplements that boost NAD+ levels more important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters to supplement companies , the FDA communicated its position that NMN does not meet the definition of a supplement because it is being investigated as a drug .\nThis is the infamous \u201c back-channel \u201d at the FDA that allows the drug industry to monopolize natural ingredients .\nHere \u2019 s how it works .\nFor supplements that are considered \u201c new \u201d under the law\u2014that is , they weren \u2019 t sold \u201c in or as a supplement \u201d before 1994\u2014companies must submit a notification to the FDA with studies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingredient can be marketed .\nThis is the deeply problematic \u201c new dietary ingredient \u201d ( NDI ) notification process that we have written about extensively over the years .\nBut here \u2019 s the issue : if a drug company files an Investigational new drug application ( IND ) and studies that ingredient before the FDA receives an NDI notification on it , it can no longer be sold as a supplement .\nThis creates a stacked deck in favor of Big Pharma monopolies .\nIND applications are confidential .\nA drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingredient and sit on it for 30 years .\nMeanwhile , an innovative supplement company could develop that nutrient into a great product , do the studies to comply with the FDA \u2019 s ridiculous notification process , and then create a market for that product\u2014and then the drug company can swoop in with their 30-year-old IND , kick the supplements out of the market , and create a monopoly .\nPart of the solution to this problem is to make IND \u2019 s public so the FDA and Big Pharma can \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important supplements .\nThis isn \u2019 t hypothetical .\nIn 2016 , the FDA announced that vinpocetine , a brain health supplement which the agency had approved as a \u201c new \u201d supplement in the 1990s , couldn \u2019 t be a supplement anymore because a drug company had filed an IND on it in the 1980s .\nSomething similar happened to the pyridoxamine version of vitamin B6 in 2008 .\nA drug company had an IND and cleared the market of pyridoxamine supplements\u2014but then never even brought a drug to market .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ version remains banned .\nIn 2018 , an executive of the company that wanted pyridoxamine supplements removed from the market petitioned for the FDA to allow pyridoxamine supplements to be sold\u2014to no avail .\nOnce gone due to this mechanism , the supplement is lost forever .\nWhat is especially outrageous about the FDA \u2019 s position is that the agency had previously acknowledged one \u201c new supplement \u201d notification on NMN\u2014the agency said nothing about the ingredient \u2019 s preclusion from being a supplement because it was being studied as a drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled a similar stunt in banning vinpocetine : it is absurd that the FDA can retroactively and unilaterally decide that a supplement is not a dietary ingredient , after it has already said that it is .\nWe argued at the time that such an action sets a dangerous precedent , and it looks like we were right .\nThe FDA did the same thing last year to NAC supplements : after years of allowing them on the market , even reviewing and accepting structure/function claims on them , the FDA suddenly decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dietary supplement .\nThe FDA \u2019 s announcement comes on the heels of a study claiming that nicotinamide riboside ( NR ) , a form of vitamin B3 , is linked to cancer .\nNR is another nutrient that has proven effective at raising NAD+ levels .\nThe study , like so many other studies claiming supplements are dangerous , suffers from a variety of shortcomings : it was an incredibly small mouse study that did not represent real world conditions\u2014mice were injected with highly aggressive cancer cells .\nMeasuring tumor formation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that NR induces breast cancer .\nFurther , NR has been heavily studied in animals , and no link to cancer has been found .\nOur concern is that the FDA will use this study to attack NR supplements and further undercut our ability to naturally raise NAD+ levels to address fatigue , mitochondrial health , and more .\nThe crux of the problem is that the law allows drug companies to create monopolies on natural ingredients that have been sold in the marketplace for years .\nPart of the reason this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drugs : the FDA has , and continues to , distrust , attack , and undermine medicines that are not \u201c FDA-approved \u201d like supplements , homeopathic medicines , and compounded drugs .\nThere \u2019 s also a belief that drug research needs to be incentivized , since the costs of bringing a drug to market can reach into the billions .\nBut this ignores the fact that taxpayers heavily subsidize these costs : a recent analysis found that , of the drugs approved between 2010 and 2016 , every one originated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funded by the government ( i.e .\ntaxpayers ) .\nGiving drug companies monopolies on natural compounds reduces consumer choice , drives up the cost of healthcare , and restricts access to products that could benefit public health .\nWe can \u2019 t let this most recent attempt to gift an important supplement as a monopoly to the drug industry succeed .\nAction Alert !\nWrite to Congress and the FDA , urging them to

of the Maine Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further , saying as many as seven other types of PFAS may still be permitted for use .\nThe EPA only says that it continues to evaluate the issue .\nDozens of

asking the FDA to ban it as a supplement so they can charge what we assume will be exorbitant sums for an NMN drug .\nIt \u2019 s shameful that millions of consumers will be denied access to a

supplement access for millions of people .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the FDA will let it happen .\nFurther , Dr. Sinclair believes that aging should be considered a disease .\nIn our view , this is part of the

IV infusion replaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clotting protein .\nJust let this sink in : according to AARP , there are four drugs that currently cost more than $ 1,000 a day to treat serious conditions like

homeopathy means\u2014let us untangle some of these knots .\nAction Alert !\nLast week , we reported on the release of the FDA \u2019 s final version of a document describing how the agency will treat homeopathic medicines moving forward .\nThe headline of that article was \u201c FDA Declares Homeopathy Illegal.\n\u201d Consumers have been justifiably outraged by this move by the FDA , but there has been some confusion about what specifically is happening .\nTo clarify what we said in our previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to disappear overnight .\nYou are still going to be able to access many homeopathic medicines .\nAs we wrote last week , OTC homeopathic medicines for cold and flu , teething , allergies , and other less serious conditions that can resolve spontaneously with or without treatment are likely safe for the time being .\nThat being said , this FDA guidance is a serious threat to homeopathic medicines because it sets the stage for the agency to remove homeopathic medicines easily and with very little evidence or support .\nWhy ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ that by the letter of the law , homeopathic medicines are currently being sold illegally because they have not been \u201c generally recognized as safe and effective , \u201d nor have they gone through FDA approval as new drugs .\nSo , if it wants to , the FDA now has the legal authority to remove any homeopathic medicine from the market .\nBut , according to the guidance , the FDA is not going to do that .\nInstead , the agency says it will exercise \u201c enforcement discretion \u201d by focusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as injectable products , products with safety issues , products intended for serious conditions or vulnerable populations , etc .\nIn theory , the FDA will turn a blind eye to many other homeopathic products that it believes are being sold illegally but do not present serious safety issues .\nHowever , the axe is dangling above these products because the FDA could , if it decided to , take enforcement action against any homeopathic products it chooses because , in the agency \u2019 s view , all homeopathic drugs are currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the FDA , a product being marketed illegally is a regulatory distinction and separate from the question of whether consumers can still purchase the product .\nThis is a similar situation that n-acetyl-L-cysteine ( NAC ) and CBD supplements face .\nRecall that the FDA \u2019 s position is that NAC does not meet the definition of a supplement , meaning it \u2019 s technically illegal to sell NAC supplements .\nThe FDA didn \u2019 t actively remove NAC from the market , but its actions did have a chilling effect\u2014Amazon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a time .\nAfter fierce backlash by ANH members and others , the FDA said it would exercise enforcement discretion as it decided whether to allow NAC to be sold as a supplement .\nSimilarly , the FDA \u2019 s current position is that CBD can not be sold as a supplement because the agency believes it was studied as a drug first .\nDespite this position , the agency has allowed continued sale of many CBD supplements , choosing mostly to go after companies making illegal health claims about their CBD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agency determines something is illegal it can choose to remove it from the market forever .\nThis is what happened , for example , to the pyridoxamine form of vitamin B6 .\nThe FDA determined it was studied as a drug before it was sold as a supplement and banned the supplement version\u2014no drug came to market , and it never returned as a supplement .\nNicotinamide mononucleotide ( NMN ) , a potent NAD+ booster , faces a similar threat .\nIt is also worth noting that the FDA is doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than going through the public rulemaking process .\nOn the top of every page of the guidance , and all agency guidances , you \u2019 ll see the statement , \u201c Contains Nonbinding Recommendations.\n\u201d But as we \u2019 ve argued for many years , this is far from the truth .\nIn practice , guidances are in fact binding and must be followed\u2014but are more difficult for the public to challenge legally .\nThis is a ruse by the FDA to avoid the accountability of the rulemaking process , which requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and consider comments on its proposed rules .\nIt is through issuing a guidance , for example , that the FDA has limited the kinds of evidence that can be used to substantiate supplement health claims .\nWe want to be clear .\nThis guidance is a very serious threat , and we are doing everything in our power to stop it .\nBut at the same time , FDA agents are not sweeping the nation \u2019 s drug stores and removing all homeopathic medicines from the shelves .\nWe do believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will target and eliminate the homeopathic medicines that compete with FDA approved drugs because the fees companies pay for drug approval fund a substantial portion of the FDA \u2019 s operations .\nHomeopathic medicines are popular for allergies , for example , and this cuts into the market for drugs : the market for antihistamine nasal sprays is just under $ 2 billion ; the market for Zyrtec , one of the most popular antihistamine drugs , was valued at $ 1.675 billion in 2021 .\nClearing the market in one fell swoop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one by one over time allows the agency to accomplish the same goal without drawing as much attention or generating as much outrage .\nWe need to communicate to Congress that voters care about access to homeopathy and other natural medicines .\nA national survey found that 70 % of Americans are more likely to support Congressional candidates who will protect access to supplements and homeopathic and other natural remedies .\nAction Alert !\nPost a comment to the public docket urging continued access to homeopathic medications , and send a similar message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately .", "author": "ANH-USA", "url":

with red tape .\nFinally , they \u2019 ve listened !\nWe are excited to share a monumental victory that has come about as a direct result of ANH-USA advocacy .\nIn 2014 , the FDA started applying drug rules to research being conducted on nutrients .\nThis caused university research on nutrients to slow or even stop in some cases , depriving us of knowledge that could be deployed to support our health .\nAfter years of pressure from ANH , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency has issued a proposed rule that will allow more research to be done on nutrients without triggering drug rules .\nWe couldn \u2019 t have accomplished this without our dedicated grassroots activists , so we thank you !\nThe FDA \u2019 s previous stance was absurd on its face .\nFor example , if a university researcher wanted to evaluate a yogurt product from the grocery store that contains probiotics for its ability to prevent constipation in healthy adults , that researcher would have to file an investigational new drug application ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the food ( or nutrient ) would be studied for its effect on a disease in the study\u2014and , according to the FDA , only drugs can claim to treat or prevent disease\u2014the researcher would need to comply with the same regulations that the drug industry does when studying a new drug in human subjects .\nThink about all of the research we \u2019 ve shared over the years about the benefits of supplements .\nWe recently reported on the evidence for magnesium in lowering blood pressure , and fish oil for preventing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the role of B vitamins in brain and heart health .\nWhen COVID hit , we needed research to be done to discover that vitamin D status was an important factor determining COVID outcomes .\nResearch helps guide our health decisions .\nIt \u2019 s not something we often think about , but it is incredibly important to our health that researchers are able to operate in a favorable climate , rather than be buried in an avalanche of red tape that stalls or prevents studies from happening altogether .\nWith this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foster a more open climate that will allow much more research on supplements to occur , arming us with more and better information to optimize our health .\nThe FDA \u2019 s newly proposed rule would , in certain situations , exempt researchers evaluating a drug use of a food or cosmetic ( that is , a food or nutrient \u2019 s ability to treat or prevent a disease ) from having to go through incredibly burdensome IND process .\nINDs are traditionally for drug research and include animal pharmacology and toxicology studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other data to demonstrate to the FDA that the substance under investigation is safe for humans and has pharmacological activity that justifies commercial development .\nThis makes sense for drug research\u2014these are new chemical compounds that should demonstrate a degree of safety before they are tested on humans .\nBut why should supplement researchers have to jump through these hoops ?\nAnd here \u2019 s the kicker : requiring an IND for this research naturally creates published studies and could turn a supplement into a drug .\nThis has to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns supplements into drugs that we \u2019 ve reported on so often .\nIf a supplement is considered \u201c new \u201d \u2014that is , it came to market after 1994\u2014then companies have to notify the FDA in advance of marketing that supplement .\nBut , if a drug company starts studying that nutrient before the FDA has received a \u201c new \u201d supplement notification on it , then the substance is technically not allowed to be sold as a supplement .\nThis is the issue we \u2019 re facing with NAC , CBD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others .\nIn its proposed rule , the FDA provides exemptions from submitting an IND if the supplement research is not going to support a new health claim or the development of the product into a drug ( and as long as the research does not present safety concerns , for example looking at vulnerable populations or employing unusual routes of administration ) .\nBecause most studies on nutrients are performed by academic researchers , not the supplement industry , this will free up researchers working at universities and hospitals to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of filing an IND .\nThis all sounds very technical but this is a huge win that will end years of stifled research on supplements .\nWhen these obstacles were initially put in place by the FDA in 2014 , there was an immediate chilling effect on supplement research .\nTake a few examples from our reporting at the time .\nJoshua Miller , PhD , professor of Nutritional Sciences at Rutgers University , told us , \u201c As an academic department chair , I would be hesitant to advise junior faculty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for IND approval [ for a nutrient study ] as they work toward tenure .\nFor academic research , it \u2019 s a major burden .\nThis [ guidance ] may shut down new research on dietary supplements in academia .\nIt also reduces U.S. jobs\u2014industry will take the research overseas where they won \u2019 t need an IND.\n\u201d There were also real-world scenarios in which the FDA \u2019 s baffling application of drug rules to nutrient research delayed or halted studies for no apparent reason .\nTwo researchers trying to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stymied by the FDA , despite the researchers following CONSORT guidelines ( recommendations for how to report on clinical trials ) , receiving Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approvals ( IRBs review a study before it starts to make sure it \u2019 s safe for human subjects ) , convening data and safety monitoring boards , and registering their trials on ClinicalTrials.gov .\nAt a symposium , the researchers expressed the concern that the U.S. would fall behind the rest of the world in probiotic clinical research due to the challenges and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has , over the years , pressured the FDA with grassroots activism , submitted a Citizen \u2019 s Petition asking for these very changes , and even met in-person with agency staff to discuss the urgent need for reform

\u2019 s where we stand on some of the top issues where ANH works to protect your access to natural health .\nSenator Dick Durbin ( D-IL ) pushed hard this year for additional regulations to increase costs and decrease access to vitamins and supplements .\nIn addition to introducing his stand-alone bill , the Dietary Supplement Listing Act of 2022 , he also attempted to attach this proposal to several larger must pass legislative packages , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Durbin \u2019 s bill never moved , and he wasn \u2019 t able to attach it to the final FDA user fee reauthorization package or to the end of year federal funding package .\nWe know he \u2019 ll continue trying to move his legislation forward in 2023 , so we will continue our efforts to protect access to supplements .\nIn 2014 , the FDA started applying drug rules to research being conducted on nutrients .\nThis caused university research on nutrients to slow or even stop in some cases , depriving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support our health .\nANH-USA pressured the FDA with grassroots activism , submitted a Citizen \u2019 s Petition asking for these very changes , and even met in-person with agency staff to discuss the urgent need for reform .\nAfter years of sustained pressure from ANH , the FDA has finally relented ; the agency has issued a proposed rule that will allow more research to be done on nutrients without triggering drug rules .\nThe FDA has stated that it plans to release an updated draft or final version of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) guidance by the end of this year .\nIt is no exaggeration to say that this is the most dangerous threat to supplements we \u2019 ve seen in decades , because it seeks to impose a drug-like pre-approval system on supplements that would eliminate an estimated 41,700 products from the market .\nWe continue to vehemently oppose the guidance as currently written and demand that substantial changes are made before the final version is released .\nCalifornia , Massachusetts , Missouri , New Jersey , New York , and Rhode Island all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access to dietary supplements .\nWe \u2019 ve seen bills like this in the past , but it is a growing issue .\nIn California and New York , the bills reached the governors \u2019 desks .\nCalifornia Governor Newsom vetoed the bill , and the New York bill is still awaiting action from Governor Hochul .\nIf the Governor does not sign or veto the bill within ten days of receiving it from the legislature in New York , the bill automatically becomes law ( the deadline for the Governor to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take action opposing the bill ) .\nGiven how close these bills are coming to being signed into law , this is certainly another avenue to restrict supplement access where we must remain vigilant .\nA back-channel exists at the FDA that allows supplements that the FDA considers \u201c new \u201d ( those that came to the market after 1994 ) to be turned into drugs while the supplement form is banned forever .\nAs a result of this loophole , CBD , NAC , NMN and other supplements ingredients are at risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketplace .\nFour years after the FDA first argued that CBD was no longer permitted in supplements , the ingredient remains in legal limbo .\nThis year , ANH supported bills in the House and the Senate to permit CBD in supplements , but they unfortunately did not move forward .\nMeanwhile , the FDA continues to send warning letters to companies selling CBD in food and beverages .\nThe Farm Bill will need to be renewed in 2023 and may provide an opportunity for progress on this issue .\nNAC faces a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edged closer to a major victory in protecting access to this critical antioxidant supplement .\nIn August , the FDA finalized an enforcement discretion saying that if it didn \u2019 t find safety issues with NAC , the Agency may issue an exemption to permit NAC in dietary supplements .\nAs we celebrated this positive news on NAC , however , FDA announced that another vital anti-aging supplement , NMN , is now also at risk .\nAfter approving a new dietary ingredient notification to permit NMN in a dietary supplement in May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November and stated that NMN could no longer be sold in dietary supplements because it was already being investigated for use in a drug .\nThis blow yet again demonstrates the need for a greater change to the law that permits pharmaceutical companies to create monopolies on natural ingredients that have been sold in the marketplace for years .\nANH is advocating for greater transparency in the investigational new drug process , in addition to a time limit on these Big Pharma monopolies to give consumers greater access to these natural ingredients .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to specifically allow NMN to be sold as a supplement .\nThe FDA recently completed its updated policy regarding how it will regulate homeopathic medicines .\nThe FDA has essentially declared all homeopathic products in the U.S. illegal .\nIn theory , the FDA will turn a blind eye to many homeopathic products that it believes are being sold illegally but do not present serious safety issues .\nHowever , the axe is dangling above these products because the FDA could , if it decided to , take enforcement action against any homeopathic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency \u2019 s view , all homeopathic drugs are currently being marketed illegally .\nIn the world of the FDA , a product being marketed illegally is a regulatory distinction and separate from the question of whether consumers can still purchase the product .\nThe FDA stated that it will focus its enforcement actions on injectable products , products with safety issues , and products intended for serious conditions or vulnerable populations .\nANH is organizing with allies to mobilize grassroots opposition to this policy to protect homeopathic medicines from FDA attack .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Threats for Thyroid and Estriol In a major win this year , the FDA \u2019 s advisory Pharmacy Compounding Advisory Committee ( PCAC ) listened to thousands of patients and consumers and voted against the FDA \u2019 s recommendation to ban compounded glutathione .\nWhile the PCAC \u2019 s recommendation does not ensure the FDA will agree to continue to permit compounded glutathione , it will be very difficult for the FDA to go against this PCAC recommendation .\nANH submitted petitions from both consumers and health professionals to PCAC arguing for continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also instrumental in coordinating glutathione \u2019 s initial nomination to be included in the list of medicines that could be legally compounded , helping to put together a list of dozens of studies attesting to glutathione \u2019 s safety and as well as comments from health practitioners about glutathione \u2019 s many uses .\nDespite this win , FDA is still actively attacking personalized compounded medications .\nIn September , the FDA declared natural desiccated thyroid ( NDT ) to be a \u201c biologic \u201d and thus ineligible for pharmacy compounding .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans with thyroid disorders .\nANH also continues to fight the FDA as they march toward a ban of compounded bioidentical hormones such as estriol , which are vital for women managing menopause and for helping with other hormone imbalances .\nIn 2022 , ANH advocated for a slew of reforms that would make cosmetics safer by , among other things , banning toxic chemicals from being included in these products .\nMeasures aimed at improving the safety of cosmetics were included in the end-of-year spending bill expected to be passed by Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous chemicals from cosmetics , but represent a step in the right direction and that Congress is listening to ANH-USA member advocacy on this topic .\nIn September , the EPA announced a proposal to designate perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA ) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid ( PFOS ) , two of the most widely used PFAS chemicals , as hazardous substances .\nBeing listed as hazardous substances by the EPA makes it easier for the government to compel polluters to foot the bill for cleaning up contaminated sites .\nMedical studies link PFAS to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced immune response , liver damage and endocrine disruption .\nThe EPA action is a positive step but falls short of what is really needed , which is designating PFAS as an entire class as hazardous substances .\nWhen the sham GMO labeling law was passed by Congress , consumers were outraged because the \u201c labeling \u201d law allowed companies to hide the contents of their food .\nInstead of plain language labeling , it allowed companies to include scannable QR codes on packaging that consumers would need to scan with a smartphone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingredients .\nNow , a federal court has ruled that a QR code alone is not an adequate GMO disclosure , and will need to be accompanied by a disclosure option accessible to all Americans .\nSignificant problems remain , but this is an important victory .\nANH advocated on hundreds of bills in 2022 .\nSpecific to vaccination choice , ANH helped kill 21 bills in nine states that threatened vaccine choice and helped pass 16 bills in ten states that promoted vaccine choice .\nOne of the hardest legislative losses this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2098 , a law that makes it easier for the state medical board to target doctors who disseminate \u201c misinformation \u201d related to COVID , and sadly , other states have introduced similar legislation .\nCensorship and restrictions on free speech continues to be a problem we are fighting at all levels as we work to protect your access to beneficial scientific information .\nAs this list shows , we \u2019 ve accomplished a lot , but there \u2019 s a lot more work to be done .\nSenator Durbin isn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of existence .\nThe FDA continues to brandish the axe over compounded medicines like estriol , so we need to remain vigilant in our defense of these critical medicines .\nWe will fight for legislation that will clarify that homeopathic medicines are not required to go through new drug approval , thus protecting consumer access to homeopathic medicines .\nWe will fight for changes that prevent drug companies from turning natural substances like CBD , NAC , and NMN into drugs .\nWe need to fight back against the ubiquitous contamination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reluctant EPA to stop protecting industry and start protecting consumers .\nWe need to build on the momentum of the GMO labeling court victory to fight for better GMO labeling disclosures so consumers can make informed choices about the foods they eat .\nLooking ahead , ANH is also deeply concerned about the development of GMO soil microbes and their potential to cause an ecological catastrophe , as we \u2019 ve seen with other experiments in genetic engineering .\nLook out in 2023 for coverage of this topic and other topics related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human health .\nThere is also a critical need to stand up to the censorship that has swept over this country .\nCensorship has long been a problem for proponents of natural health , who often are targets of so-called \u201c skeptics \u201d and \u201c quackbusters , \u201d but the COVID pandemic sent this tendency into overdrive , providing censors with a pretext to silence those who challenge medical orthodoxies as threats to public health .\nSocial media companies and state and federal governments have gotten in on the action .\nIf doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the mainstream medical approach , not only are the legal requirements of informed consent not being satisfied , but integrative doctors \u2019 ability to treat individual patients will suffer .\nWe will continue to fight against and expose censorship of natural health information .\nWe have a lot of plans for 2023 , but we \u2019 re also aware of the need to be nimble in responding to the curveballs thrown by the FDA and other federal agencies that threaten our ability to stay healthy , naturally .\nWe appreciate your support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our work in 2023 .", "author": "ANH-USA", "url":

answer : yes !\nThe FDA recently approved the first FMT drug last week for the treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection ( CDI ) in patients who have already completed a course of antibiotic treatment .\nOnly by the twisted logic of the FDA could human poop be considered a drug .\nYet again , the FDA has taken a treatment that was widely and cheaply available and turned it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transferring fecal matter from a healthy donor into an infected patient to repair the gut microbiota .\nEven before the FDA approved Rebyota , the writing was on the wall that the agency wanted FMT to be an agency-approved drug .\nThe FDA had previously signaled its intentions to treat FMT as a drug in 2013 , but was forced to backtrack after public backlash .\nWith multiple drug companies pursuing FMT products , non-profit stool banks are closing .\nOpenBiome , the pioneers of FMT that previously provided most of the samples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans to wind down their operations but vowed to continue providing stool samples to clinicians until the first drug treatment was approved .\nWhere once there were millions of potential donors who could offer a stool sample in addition to stool banks , now there is one company that has a virtual monopoly .\nWe don \u2019 t yet have information on how much Rebyota will cost , but you can bet it will be expensive .\nIt also isn \u2019 t clear what benefit the approved drug offers over the previous system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you knew or use a sample from a bank like OpenBiome .\nThe FDA \u2019 s announcement stresses that the drug is prepared from stool donated by qualified individuals , and the donor and the donated stool are tested for a panel of transmissible pathogens .\nBut OpenBiome had similar safeguards in place , including a detailed screening process for donors .\nOpenBiome also screened the samples themselves .\nIt is unclear if the drug can improve on these safety measures .\nThere is , of course , an inherent risk in using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all things for which stool samples should be screened ; additionally , donors can be carriers for certain diseases but show no signs of the disease , presenting an additional safety issue .\nThe risks for certain patients will outweigh the benefits , but the point is that an approved drug does not seem to offer additional safety from stool banks .\nIn fact , for many patients the approved drug may be more dangerous , as it contains PEG , or polyethylene glycol .\nRecall that this ingredient was also in Pfizer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was suspected to be the culprit behind the severe allergic reactions caused by these vaccines .\nNow , if you want FMT , you \u2019 ll have to deal with a potential reaction to PEG .\nThe package insert for Rebyota does not list an active ingredient .\nIt merely states that the drug is \u201c an opaque fecal microbiota suspension \u201d and that \u201c each 150mL dose of Rebyota contains between 1\u00d7108 and 5\u00d71010 colony forming units ( CFU ) per mL of fecal microbes including > 1\u00d7105 CFU/mL of Bacteroides.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ferring a monopoly on FMT .\nThe human microbiome is incredibly diverse and varies widely from individual to individual .\nWhile we are 99.9 percent identical in terms of our genetic makeup , our microbiomes can be 80-90 percent different .\nThere are 300-500 bacterial species in the microbiota .\nThe Bacteroides genus consists of about 30 species .\nThe gut relies not just on one genus , but a thriving ecosystem that includes other microbes not named by Ferring in their formulation , including bacteria like Firmicutes and Akkermansia muciniphila .\nFerring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its formulation , yet by all accounts has a monopoly on all of FMT , no matter what bacteria are present .\nThis is all part of the FDA \u2019 s game to grant drug monopolies and line the pockets of Big Pharma executives .\nNote that Rebyota received Orphan Drug designation , meaning no other FMT drug can be approved to treat CDI for seven years .\nFerring Pharmaceuticals , the manufacturer of Rebyota , won the race , beating out other FMT drugs in development , including one from Seres Therapeutics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nestle to commercialize the drug upon approval .\nA company could , in theory , develop another FMT drug for a different indication , but that period of exclusivity would only last three years according to FDA regulations since FMT has already been approved .\nIt \u2019 s no wonder that drug companies have been foaming at the mouth at the prospects for FMT : it \u2019 s had an 80 % success rate at treating CDI , an antibiotic resistant bacterial infection that hits 500,000 Americans a year and kills 30,000 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for using FMT to treat illness .\nIt is
