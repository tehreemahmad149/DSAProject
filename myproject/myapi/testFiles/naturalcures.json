of 3 would be concerned by a less good solidity of her skeleton after 50 years because of the menopause and a fall of the estrogen rate .\nFrom the age of 35 onwards , the skeleton does not bind calcium as well and its protein structure becomes poorer .\nThe first clinical signs are often visible in the gums\u2026 ( Read more ) If a gum inflammation has already persisted for years , the loss of the bone around the teeth accelerates and can suddenly jeopardize the future of the teeth .\nMenopause is a key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the teeth , because of this natural tendency to demineralization .\nOsteoporosis is characterized by an imbalance between the work of osteoblasts and osteoclasts .\nThat is , the osteoblasts that build bone work less than the osteoclasts that destroy bone because the latter are slowed down in their action by estrogens .\nSince menopause is linked to the cessation of estrogen secretion , it is easy to understand that osteoclasts are no longer slowed down in their bone destruction .\nIf the periodontium ( bones and gums ) has already been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , the arrival of the menopause will accelerate the process of bone destruction in an irreversible way , all the more so , if the hygiene of life favors mineral deficiencies .\nAt menopause , the main factors that aggravate osteoporosis and have a direct impact on the gums are Milk : a bad thing for the gums too Paradoxically , a diet too rich in cow \u2019 s milk is contraindicated in case of periodontal disease in a person who has osteoporosis .\nWithout going back over the controversy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the gums , we know that dairy products are clearly involved in chronic inflammatory processes of the arthritic , articular or tissue type .\nPeriodontitis is an inflammatory disease at the beginning , which becomes infectious without treatment .\nFurthermore , cow \u2019 s milk contains minerals that are not assimilated in the human body .\nToo much consumption of dairy products causes hypercalcemia in the blood , which is eliminated directly in the urine and does not affect the bones .\nThis hypercalcemia causes a disturbance in the metabolism of iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary for bone regeneration .\nThis excess of calcium also hinders the metabolism of zinc which is essential to our immunity , and the immune solicitation is very important in case of periodontal disease .\nResearchers , such as Dr. Oudineau , have shown that milk is a source of fermentation and intestinal putrefaction .\nDairy products irritate the intestinal wall and promote porosity of the mucosa and chronic self-poisoning .\nThis intestinal condition is closely related to periodontal disease .\nDuring this key period , it is therefore necessary to choose a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calcium .\nMenopausal women over 50 years old need 1200mg of calcium per day .\nThe foods that contain the most calcium are seaweed ( 4000mg ) , which may explain why Japanese women are never subject to osteoporosis .\nAnother food very rich in assimilable calcium is oyster meat powder ( POP ) which contains 1750mg of calcium .\nOther foods to consider are : almonds , coconut milk , kidney beans , chickpeas , oranges , sesame seeds , chia seeds , herbs , nettles and alfalfa , green leafy vegetables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruits and tofu .\nDairy products can also be eaten , but mare \u2019 s milk , sheep \u2019 s milk or goat \u2019 s milk prepared in koumis or fermented .\nIt is also necessary to ensure a daily protein intake , fish , seafood , eggs , vegetable proteins , because the framework of the bone is of protein nature .\nVegetarians can easily find themselves in protein deficiency , tissue deficiency in zinc , as soon as there is a drop in vigilance on the food associations that ensure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the formation of proteins .\nA hypo-toxic diet without gluten or dairy products is necessary , taking care not to eat acidifying foods .\nAlso , think about a contribution of silica in all its forms .\nMany laboratories make food supplements based on silica .\nAlso monitor your vitamin D levels , as vitamin D promotes the absorption of calcium by the digestive tract .\nDon \u2019 t forget trace elements such as boron and fluoride ( note : we are not talking about fluoride in weight ) , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Japanese condiment ) made from fermented soybean extract is an exceptional source of vitamin K2 .\nOur grandmothers also prevented osteoporosis by making the famous egg/lemon cure , by soaking an egg in lemon juice .\nThe citric acid of the lemon with the calcium of the shell gives a calcium citrate which is much more assimilable , and which will also contribute to deacidify the internal environment .\nYou can also add capsules of lithotam which is a micro alga that produces a fine shell rich in calcium .\nCistus pollen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intestinal flora and restoring the acid-base balance , limits bone resorption .\nAnd finally , if women with osteoporosis are generally advised to do sports to make their bones denser , it is extremely important to chew food correctly , for a long time and bilaterally , in order to strengthen the bone of the gums .\nGood chewing increases the density of the bone around the dental roots .\nThere is no need to wait until menopause to put all these good tips in place , choose prevention .",

a trend in recent years and a real alternative to traditional cigarettes .\nUsers think it is a safe way to wean themselves off cigarettes , but this is ignoring the damage of electronic cigarettes in the mouth and on health .\nMarketing of the electronic cigarette Smokers are now turning to e-cigarettes , which are said to be safer than regular cigarettes because they produce an aerosol instead of smoke and the amount of nicotine can be controlled by users .\nSince their invention in 2003 by a Chinese pharmacist , Han Li , and since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have seen a rapid increase in use .\nThere is a real public perception that e-cigarettes are harmless .\nPeople traditionally use them to quit smoking thinking they are doing it safely .\nVaping , what they don \u2019 t tell you Electronic cigarettes contain various potentially toxic chemicals such as diethylene glycol ( used in antifreeze ) , acetol , diacetyl , lead , nickel , and chromium that can be inhaled , even though they are present in much lower concentrations than in tobacco smoke , the risk still exists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is a humectant that allows the production of smoke and reveals the taste of flavors .\nIt is considered low toxicity and non-oncogenic , also used by the pharmaceutical , food and entertainment industries .\nGlycerol or vegetable glycerin also plays a role in smoke production .\nAs for flavors , they can be of natural origin based on animal or vegetable raw materials intended for human consumption or synthetic , from chemosynthesis .\nThe latter are not subject to any code or regulation .\nAnother problem of electronic cigarettes still puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong dependence and is involved in the development of cardiovascular diseases , especially atherosclerosis .\nSo happy to be free of cigarettes users become addicted to electronic cigarettes !\nDanger of vaping in the mouth By its vasoconstrictor action , nicotine also inhibits the production of saliva .\nThe decrease in the amount of saliva can make patients vulnerable to many oral problems , such as the accumulation of bacteria , stomatitis , xerostomia ( dry mouth ) and therefore dental caries and gum inflammation .\nClinical studies have been done to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result of their treatment in non-smokers or in people using electronic cigarettes .\nIn people with moderate chronic periodontitis , 3 months after non-surgical periodontal treatment , there was a significant reduction in all symptoms in non-smokers , while there was no clinical improvement in vapers , and even a worsening of inflammation , despite the treatments .\nOther studies have also reported that daily use of electronic cigarettes is associated with a significant increase in the risk of permanent tooth loss in adults in the United States .\nIt has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor for staying healthy , although conclusions are difficult to draw due to the multiplicity of products and lifestyle habits of vapers .\nBut all studies converge on the same result that there is potential damage to oral health associated with the use of electronic cigarettes .\nA recent study published in the Journal of Cellular Physiology found a high rate of oral cell death due to exposure to e-cigarette vapor in just a few days ( 3 ) .\nSimilarly , a study conducted at the University of Rochester Medical Center proves @ @

of vaping .\nFor example , according to a team of scientists from the New York University School of Medicine , vaping may increase the risk of certain cancers and heart disease .\nThey consider that the nicotine present in electronic cigarettes could damage the DNA of many organs and reduce the body \u2019 s genetic repair mechanisms ( 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e-cigarettes can cause toxic effects in the lungs .\nAerosols from e-cigarettes induce pro-inflammatory responses .\nIt can increase coughing and wheezing in adolescents , as well as asthma exacerbations and throat irritation ( 2 ) .\nE-cigarettes can also harm brain development in children and young adults .\nOtherwise , e-cigarettes contain more particles than traditional cigarettes that can cause lung and systemic

e-cigarettes remain unclear .\nThey are relatively new , and scientists still know little about their long-term effects .\nIt \u2019 s important to realize that people would have you believe that they

that are more or less hidden in vaporettes .\n2- G.
