Republican National Convention , July 17 1980 A superb article by @ ShellenbergerMD on the root causes of Western weakness in the face of Russian aggression .\nWhile we banned plastic straws , Russia drilled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vladimir Putin\u2014a man ruling a country with an economy smaller than that of Texas , with an average life expectancy 10 years lower than that of France\u2014managed to launch an unprovoked full-scale assault on Ukraine ?\nThere is a deep psychological , political and almost civilizational answer to that question : He wants Ukraine to be part of Russia more than the West wants it to be free .\nHe is willing to risk tremendous loss of life and treasure to get it .\nThere are serious limits to how much the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd Putin knows it .\nMissing from that explanation , though , is a story about material reality and basic economics\u2014two things that Putin seems to understand far better than his counterparts in the free world and especially in Europe .\nPutin knows that Europe produces 3.6 million barrels of oil a day but uses 15 million barrels of oil a day .\nPutin knows that Europe produces 230 billion cubic meters of natural gas a year but uses 560 billion cubic meters .\nHe knows that Europe uses 950 million tons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that .\nThe former KGB agent knows Russia produces 11 million barrels of oil per day but only uses 3.4 million .\nHe knows Russia now produces over 700 billion cubic meters of gas a year but only uses around 400 billion .\nRussia mines 800 million tons of coal each year but uses 300 .\nThat \u2019 s how Russia ends up supplying about 20 percent of Europe \u2019 s oil , 40 percent of its gas , and 20 percent of its coal .\nThe math is simple .\nA child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ didn \u2019 t have a muscular deterrent threat to prevent Russian aggression\u2014and in fact prevented the U.S. from getting allies to do more\u2014is that it needs Putin \u2019 s oil and gas .\nThe question is why .\nHow is it possible that European countries , Germany especially , allowed themselves to become so dependent on an authoritarian country over the 30 years since the end of the Cold War ?\nHere \u2019 s how : These countries are in the grips of a delusional ideology that makes them incapable of understanding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideology insists we don \u2019 t need nuclear and that we don \u2019 t need fracking .\nIt insists that it \u2019 s just a matter of will and money to switch to all-renewables\u2014and fast .\nIt insists that we need \u201c degrowth \u201d of the economy , and that we face looming human \u201c extinction.\n\u201d ( I would know .\nI myself was once a true believer . )\nJohn Kerry , the United States \u2019 climate envoy , perfectly captured the myopia of this view when he said , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Russian invasion of Ukraine \u201c could have a profound negative impact on the climate , obviously .\nYou have a war , and obviously you \u2019 re going to have massive emissions consequences to the war .\nBut equally importantly , you \u2019 re going to lose people \u2019 s focus.\n\u201d But it was the West \u2019 s focus on healing the planet with \u201c soft energy \u201d renewables , and moving away from natural gas and nuclear , that allowed Putin to gain a stranglehold over Europe \u2019 s energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hypnotic trance about healing its relationship with nature , averting climate apocalypse and worshiping a teenager named Greta , Vladimir Putin made his moves .\nWhile he expanded nuclear energy at home so Russia could export its precious oil and gas to Europe , Western governments spent their time and energy obsessing over \u201c carbon footprints , \u201d a term created by an advertising firm working for British Petroleum .\nThey banned plastic straws because of a 9-year-old Canadian child \u2019 s science homework .\nThey paid for hours of \u201c climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia \u2019 s oil production , expanded natural gas production , and then doubled nuclear energy production to allow more exports of its precious gas , Europe , led by Germany , shut down its nuclear power plants , closed gas fields , and refused to develop more through advanced methods like fracking .\nThe numbers tell the story best .\nIn 2016 , 30 percent of the natural gas consumed by the European Union came from Russia .\nIn 2018 , that figure jumped to 40 percent .\nBy 2020 , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early 2021 , it was nearly 47 percent .\nFor all his fawning over Putin , Donald Trump , back in 2018 , defied diplomatic protocol to call out Germany publicly for its dependence on Moscow .\n\u201c Germany , as far as I \u2019 m concerned , is captive to Russia because it \u2019 s getting so much of its energy from Russia , \u201d Trump said .\nThis prompted Germany \u2019 s then-chancellor , Angela Merkel , who had been widely praised in polite circles for being the last serious leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her country \u201c can make our own policies and make our own decisions.\n\u201d The result has been the worst global energy crisis since 1973 , driving prices for electricity and gasoline higher around the world .\nIt is a crisis , fundamentally , of inadequate supply .\nBut the scarcity is entirely manufactured .\nEuropeans\u2014led by figures like Greta Thunberg and European Green Party leaders , and supported by Americans like John Kerry\u2014believed that a healthy relationship with the Earth requires making energy scarce .\nBy turning to renewables , they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harming the planet .\nBut this was a pipe dream .\nYou can \u2019 t power a whole grid with solar and wind , because the sun and the wind are inconstant , and currently existing batteries aren \u2019 t even cheap enough to store large quantities of electricity overnight , much less across whole seasons .\nIn service to green ideology , they made the perfect the enemy of the good\u2014and of Ukraine .\nGreen campaigns have succeeded in destroying German energy independence\u2014they call it Energiewende , or \u201c energy turnaround \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version of environmentalism .\nIt calls climate change a near-term apocalyptic threat to human survival while turning up its nose at the technologies that can help address climate change most and soonest : nuclear and natural gas .\nAt the turn of the millennium , Germany \u2019 s electricity was around 30 percent nuclear-powered .\nBut Germany has been sacking its reliable , inexpensive nuclear plants .\n( Thunberg called nuclear power \u201c extremely dangerous , expensive , and time-consuming \u201d despite the UN \u2019 s International Panel on Climate Change deeming it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear the safest way to make reliable power . )\nBy 2020 , Germany had reduced its nuclear share from 30 percent to 11 percent .\nThen , on the last day of 2021 , Germany shut down half of its remaining six nuclear reactors .\nThe other three are slated for shutdown at the end of this year .\n( Compare this to nextdoor France , which fulfills 70 percent of its electricity needs with carbon-free nuclear plants . )\nGermany has also spent lavishly on weather-dependent renewables\u2014to the tune of $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrial wind turbines .\nBut those have their problems .\nSolar panels have to go somewhere , and a solar plant in Europe needs 400 to 800 times more land than natural gas or nuclear plants to make the same amount of power .\nFarmland has to be cut apart to host solar .\nAnd solar energy is getting cheaper these days mainly because Europe \u2019 s supply of solar panels is produced by slave labor in concentration camps as part of China \u2019 s genocide against Uighur Muslims .\nThe upshot here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough on climate initiatives to fix things if you ignore nuclear and gas .\nBetween 2015 and 2025 , Germany \u2019 s efforts to green its energy production will have cost $ 580 billion .\nYet despite this enormous investment , German electricity still costs 50 percent more than nuclear-friendly France \u2019 s , and generating it produces eight times more carbon emissions per unit .\nPlus , Germany is getting over a third of its energy from Russia .\nGermany has trapped itself .\nIt could burn more coal and undermine its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could use more natural gas , which generates half the carbon emissions of coal , but at the cost of dependence on imported Russian gas .\nBerlin was faced with a choice between unleashing the wrath of Putin on neighboring countries or inviting the wrath of Greta Thunberg .\nThey chose Putin .\nBecause of these policy choices , Vladimir Putin could turn off the gas flows to Germany , and quickly threaten Germans \u2019 ability to cook or stay warm .\nHe or his successor will hold this power for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s as if you knew that hackers had stolen your banking details , but you won \u2019 t change your password .\nThis is why Germany successfully begged the incoming Biden administration not to oppose a contentious new gas pipeline from Russia called Nord Stream 2 .\nThis cut against the priorities of green-minded governance : On day one of Biden \u2019 s presidency , one of the new administration \u2019 \u2019 s first acts was to shut down the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to the U.S. in service to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipeline was too important to get the same treatment given how dependent Germany is on Russian imports .\n( Once Russia invaded , Germany was finally dragged into nixing Nord Stream 2 , for now . )\nNaturally , when American sanctions on Russia \u2019 s biggest banks were finally announced in concert with European allies last week , they specifically exempted energy productsso Russia and Europe can keep doing that dirty business .\nA few voices called for what would really hit Russia where it hurts : cutting off energy imports .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy utilities jumped to buy more contracts for the Russian oil and gas that flows through Ukraine .\nThat \u2019 s because they have no other good options right now , after green activism \u2019 s attacks on nuclear and importing fracked gas from America .\nThere \u2019 s no current plan for powering Europe that doesn \u2019 t involve buying from Putin .\nWe should take Russia \u2019 s invasion of Ukraine as a wake-up call .\nStanding up for Western civilization this time requires cheap , abundant , and reliable energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations .\nNational security , economic growth , and sustainability requires greater reliance on nuclear and natural gas , and less on solar panels and wind turbines , which make electricity too expensive .\nThe first and most obvious thing that should be done is for President Biden to call on German Chancellor Scholz to restart the three nuclear reactors that Germany closed in December .\nA key step in the right direction came on Sunday when Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck , the economy and climate minister , announced that Germany would at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Germany turns these three on and cancels plans to turn off the three others , those six should produce enough electricity to replace 11 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year\u2014an eighth of Germany \u2019 s current needs .\nSecond , we need concerted action led by Biden , Congress , and their Canadian counterparts to significantly expand oil and natural gas output from North America to ensure the energy security of our allies in Europe and Asia .\nNorth America is more energy-rich than anyone dreamed .\nYes , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent by pipeline .\nBut it would mean Europe could address Putin \u2019 s war on Ukraine , rather than financing it .\nExporting gas by ship requires special terminals at ports to liquify ( by cooling ) natural gas ; environmentalists oppose these terminals because of their ideological objection to any combustible fuel .\nSo it \u2019 s a good sign that Chancellor Sholz announced plans on Sunday to build two of these terminals to receive North American gas , along with announcing major new military spending to counter Russia .\nThird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear plants and start building them .\nEvery country should invest in next-generation nuclear fuel technology while recognizing that the current generation of light-water reactors are our best tool for creating energy at home , with no emissions , right now .\nWhat you \u2019 ve heard about waste is mostly pseudoscience .\nStoring used fuel rods is a trivial problem , already solved around the world by keeping them in steel and concrete cans .\nThe more nuclear power we generate , the less oil and gas we have to burn .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy from Russia .\nPutin \u2019 s relentless focus on energy reality has left him in a stronger position than he should ever have been allowed to find himself .\nIt \u2019 s not too late for the rest of the West to save the world from tyrannical regimes that have been empowered by our own energy superstitions .\nBest-selling author of \u201c San Fransicko \u201d ( HarperCollins , 2021 ) \u201c Apocalypse Never \u201d ( HarperCollins 2020 ) : : Time

take a bow and enjoy this quality reflection by Author Gabrielle Bauer .\nNothing in her story is dissimilar to how sceptics of climate alarm are smeared , vilified , othered , and cancelled .\nExact same tactics employed .\n\u201c The urge to save humanity is almost always a false-front for the urge to rule it.\n\u201d \u2013 H.L .\nMencken \u201c Of all tyrannies , a tyranny sincerely @ @ @ @ @

S. Lewis From : Those Who Chose Shaming Over Science \u22c6 Brownstone Institute Those Who Chose Shaming Over Science For the first 62 years of my life , I don \u2019 t recall anyone calling me a selfish idiot , much less a sociopath or a mouth-breathing Trumptard .\nAll that changed when Covid rolled in and I expressed , ever so gingerly , a few concerns about the lockdown policies .\nHere \u2019 s a sampling of what the keyboard warriors threw back at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and catch the virus .\n\u2022 Have fun choking on your own fluids in the ICU .\n\u2022 Name three loved ones that you \u2019 re ready to sacrifice to Covid .\nDo it now , coward .\n\u2022 You went to Harvard ?\nYeah , right , and I \u2019 m God .\nLast I checked , Harvard doesn \u2019 t accept troglodytes .\nFrom the earliest days of the pandemic , something deep inside me\u2014in my soul , if you will\u2014recoiled from the political and public response to the virus .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ or true .\nThis was not just an epidemiological crisis , but a societal one , so why were we listening exclusively to some select epidemiologists ?\nWhere were the mental health experts ?\nThe child development specialists ?\nThe historians ?\nThe economists ?\nAnd why were our political leaders encouraging fear rather than calm ?\nThe questions that troubled me the most had less to do with epidemiology than with ethics : Was it fair to require the greatest sacrifice from the youngest members of society , who stood to suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil liberties simply disappear during a pandemic , or did we need to balance public safety with human rights ?\nUnschooled in the ways of online warriors , I assumed the Internet would allow me to engage in \u201c productive discussions \u201d about these issues .\nSo I hopped online , and the rest was hysteria .\nVillage idiot , flat earther , inbred trash , negative IQ\u2026 Let \u2019 s just say that my thin skin got the test of a lifetime .\nAnd it wasn \u2019 t just me : anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ordinary citizen , got a similar skinburn .\nIn the words of one community physician , who for obvious reasons shall remain anonymous : \u201c Many doctors including myself , along with virologists , epidemiologists and other scientists , advocated a targeted approach and a focus on the most vulnerable cohorts of patients , only to be dismissed as anti-science , tin foil hat kooks , conspiracy theorists , antivax and other equally colorful disparaging labels.\n\u201d Early in the game I decided I wouldn \u2019 t respond to such insults with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-minded , but because mudslinging contests just leave me angry and it \u2019 s not fun to walk around angry all day .\nInstead , I took the shaming on the chin ( and still walked around angry ) .\nThe shaming impulse asserted itself right from the start of the pandemic .\nOn Twitter , # covidiot began trending on the evening of March 22 , 2020 , and by the time the night was over , 3,000 tweets had coopted the hashtag to denounce poor public health practices .\nWhen CBS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partying in Miami , outraged citizens shared the students \u2019 names in their social media networks , accompanied by such missives as \u201c do not give these selfish dumbfucks beds and/or respirators.\n\u201d In the early days of the pandemic , when panic and confusion reigned , such indignation could perhaps be forgiven .\nBut the shaming gained momentum and wove itself into the zeitgeist .\nAlso : it didn \u2019 t work .\nAs noted by Harvard Medical School epidemiologist Julia Marcus , \u201c shaming and blaming people is not the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior and actually can be counterproductive because it makes people want to hide their behavior.\n\u201d Along similar lines , Jan Balkus , an infectious disease specialist at the University of Washington , maintains that shaming can make it harder for people to \u201c acknowledge situations where they may have encountered risk.\n\u201d If shaming \u201c covidiots \u201d for their behavior doesn \u2019 t accomplish much , you can be sure that shaming people for Wrongthink won \u2019 t change any minds .\nInstead , we heretics simply stop telling the shamers what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smile .\nWe give them the match point and continue the debate in our own heads .\nFor two years I \u2019 ve been that person .\nI \u2019 ve smiled politely while dodging insults .\nTo put my interlocutors at ease , I \u2019 ve prefaced my heterodox opinions with disclaimers like \u201c I dislike Trump as much as you do \u201d or \u201c For the record , I \u2019 m triple-vaxxed myself.\n\u201d Just today , I \u2019 ll allow myself to drop the pandering and call it as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on me for questioning the shutdown of civilization and calling out the damage it inflicted on the young and the poor : you can take your shaming , your scientific posturing , your insufferable moralizing , and stuff it .\nEvery day , new research knocks more air out of your smug pronouncements .\nYou told me that without lockdowns , Covid would have wiped out a third of the world , much as the Black Death decimated Europe in the 14th century .\nInstead , a Johns Hopkins meta-analysis concluded that lockdowns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortality by an average of 0.2 % .\nWhat \u2019 s more , long before this study we had good evidence that anything less than a China-style door-welding lockdown wouldn \u2019 t do much good .\nIn a 2006 paper , the WHO Writing Group affirmed that \u201c mandatory case reporting and isolating patients during the influenza pandemic of 1918 did not stop virus transmission and were impractical.\n\u201d You told me that social interaction is a want , not a need .\nWell , yes .\nSo is good food .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported in a September 2020 review article published in Cell , loneliness \u201c may be the most potent threat to survival and longevity.\n\u201d The article explains how social isolation lowers cognitive development , weakens the immune system , and puts people at risk of substance use disorders .\nAnd it \u2019 s not like we didn \u2019 t know this before Covid : in 2017 , research by Brigham Young University professor Julianne Holt-Lunstad determined that social isolation accelerates mortality as much as smoking 15 cigarettes per day .\nHer findings splashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world
