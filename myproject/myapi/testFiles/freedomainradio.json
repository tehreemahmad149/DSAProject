Prologue", "content": "Thanks for everyone giving me feedback on the beginning of my new book \u2018 The Future \u2019 \u2013 I like books that start kind of opaque , but some people did find it confusing , so I wrote a prologue which will go at the start of the book \u2013 let me know what you think !\nThe war had entered its fifth century .\nIt was no longer even referred to as a \u201c war \u201d anymore .\nViolence and murder had wound so deeply into human life that the few who still fought for freedom often welcomed death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despair of a hopeless battle .\nThe men who finally ended the war had stopped fighting decades before , because they realized that battling evil simply created more trauma , more violence , more murder , more death\u2026 The men who finally killed evil hid themselves in a deep mountain and made a cure from a bottomless well of pure nihilism .\nIf you fight evil , evil grows .\nIf you do not fight evil , evil rules\u2026 This hopeless mantra that had encircled the jugular of the species since the species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under a cloudless sky , when the rising sun had yet to brighten the overhead stars into invisibility .\nThe trees were dark on the high mountainside when the men emerged from a cave , pulling giant crates with grunting muscles .\nTheir eyes flickered with mad purpose and tentative hope .\nAxes were strapped to their belts .\nThe lowering sunlight from the rising sun lit up the white-flecked tops of the cherry trees that clung to the edges of the mountain .\nOne tall man with a dark beard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes cleared his throat , then spoke to his companions , his friends , his co-conspirators in the murder of murder .\n\u201c We don \u2019 t even know how few people we are down to \u2013 I would guess 5 % of the former population.\n\u201d He gestured at the circle of silent men , dark as shadows in the dying night .\n\u201c We have withdrawn from having families to sacrifice ourselves for the future of mankind .\nWe are the modern monks bringing heavenly peace a warring world .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder have reigned supreme .\nMany here have come to believe that war will only end when mankind ends .\nOur solution\u2026 \u201d The bearded man stopped speaking , his tongue paralyzed by the sudden shocks of horror in the faces of his companions .\nThe man closest to him pointed and whispered : \u201c Your forehead\u2026 \u201d The bearded man lifted his hand past the rising sun .\nAbove his eyes , his hand turned bright red , the edges of his fingertips bleeding bloody laser light .\nHigh overhead \u2013 barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle sky \u2013 a gathering ruby light gleamed on a tiny white dot .\nThe men hesitated .\nThe cure for violence might be close , but death might be even closer\u2026 \u201c IF WE FAIL , LIFE WILL NOT BE WORTH LIVING !\n\u201d The bearded man tore his axe from his belt and swung with all his strength at the closest crate .\nIt cracked and shattered , revealing rows of tiny blonde heads .\nA terrifying pressure descended from the lightening sky .\nThe men \u2019 s hair leapt up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !\nNOW !\nHELP ME !\n\u201d cried the bearded man .\n\u201c They can be copied , the blueprints are inside \u2013 COME ON \u2013 IT CAN NOT ALL HAVE BEEN FOR NOTHING MY BROTHERS !\n\u201d Screaming , the men suddenly leapt forward with their axes as the air began to glow around them .\nThe birds , startled from their sleep , rose suddenly from the cherry trees into the brightening sky , where their feathers began to burn , and they cried out in agony .\nHacking as their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smashed open the crates , and tiny dark creatures with whirring white wings rose into the air like startled dragonflies .\nThe flying fragments of wood began to burn .\nThe men screamed as they began to melt , but an inhuman will kept their burning arms flying , and more winged creatures flew free of the crates .\nHundreds of tiny bodies with white wings flew with blinding speed up from the mountain as it began to turn a terrifying blue-white .\nThey flew into the sky \u2013 up beyond the yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creatures paused in their flight , turning their heads down towards the blinding white collapsing mountain .\nAs one , they flew up as a shockwave blasted up from the massive new crater that was rapidly swallowing countless tons of rock and rubble .\nTheir white wings whirring faintly , the creatures hovered over the groaning earth , above the mushroom cloud of the former mountain .\nThe creatures looked down for a long while , then looked at each other .\nTheir blonde hair and blue eyes shone vividly in the rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an electric pause , and then \u2013 as one \u2013 the creatures raised their blue eyes to the tiny white dot high in the sky , just below the midnight meridian that was slowly swallowing the remaining stars above .\nAgain as one , the creatures \u2019 wings began to beat faster , and they rose like an eerie reverse snowfall .\nWeapons appeared in their tiny pink hands as they flew like a narrow blown blizzard towards the weapon that had destroyed their masters .\nIt was the beginning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe Angels had arrived to save mankind .", "author": "Stefan Molyneux", "url": "https://www.freedomain.com/2022/06/27/the-future-prologue/", "published": "Mon, 27 Jun 2022 22:55:54

in the past .\nIt fills me with hope and drive to work for that future and , maybe paradoxically , reminds me what a privilege it is to be here , now.\n\u201d You can read the prologue below \u2013 or you can watch it at https : //rumble.com/v1afyb9-stefan-molyneuxs-new-book-the-future-prologue.html The war had entered its fifth century .\nIt was no longer even referred to as a \u201c war \u201d anymore .\nViolence and murder had wound so deeply into human life that the few who still fought for freedom often welcomed death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despair of a hopeless battle .\nThe men who finally ended the war had stopped fighting decades before , because they realized that battling evil simply created more trauma , more violence , more murder , more death\u2026 The men who finally killed evil hid themselves in a deep mountain and made a cure from a bottomless well of pure nihilism .\nIf you fight evil , evil grows .\nIf you do not fight evil , evil rules\u2026 This hopeless mantra that had encircled the jugular of the species since the species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under a cloudless sky , when the rising sun had yet to brighten the overhead stars into invisibility .\nThe trees were dark on the high mountainside when the men emerged from a cave , pulling giant crates with grunting muscles .\nTheir eyes flickered with mad purpose and tentative hope .\nAxes were strapped to their belts .\nThe lowering sunlight from the rising sun lit up the white-flecked tops of the cherry trees that clung to the edges of the mountain .\nOne tall man with a dark beard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes cleared his throat , then spoke to his companions , his friends , his co-conspirators in the murder of murder .\n\u201c We don \u2019 t even know how few people we are down to \u2013 I would guess 5 % of the former population.\n\u201d He gestured at the circle of silent men , dark as shadows in the dying night .\n\u201c We have withdrawn from having families to sacrifice ourselves for the future of mankind .\nWe are the modern monks bringing heavenly peace a warring world .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder have reigned supreme .\nMany here have come to believe that war will only end when mankind ends .\nOur solution\u2026 \u201d The bearded man stopped speaking , his tongue paralyzed by the sudden shocks of horror in the faces of his companions .\nThe man closest to him pointed and whispered : \u201c Your forehead\u2026 \u201d The bearded man lifted his hand past the rising sun .\nAbove his eyes , his hand turned bright red , the edges of his fingertips bleeding bloody laser light .\nHigh overhead \u2013 barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle sky \u2013 a gathering ruby light gleamed on a tiny white dot .\nThe men hesitated .\nThe cure for violence might be close , but death might be even closer\u2026 \u201c IF WE FAIL , LIFE WILL NOT BE WORTH LIVING !\n\u201d The bearded man tore his axe from his belt and swung with all his strength at the closest crate .\nIt cracked and shattered , revealing rows of tiny blonde heads .\nA terrifying pressure descended from the lightening sky .\nThe men \u2019 s hair leapt up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !\nNOW !\nHELP ME !\n\u201d cried the bearded man .\n\u201c They can be copied , the blueprints are inside \u2013 COME ON \u2013 IT CAN NOT ALL HAVE BEEN FOR NOTHING MY BROTHERS !\n\u201d Screaming , the men suddenly leapt forward with their axes as the air began to glow around them .\nThe birds , startled from their sleep , rose suddenly from the cherry trees into the brightening sky , where their feathers began to burn , and they cried out in agony .\nHacking as their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smashed open the crates , and tiny dark creatures with whirring white wings rose into the air like startled dragonflies .\nThe flying fragments of wood began to burn .\nThe men screamed as they began to melt , but an inhuman will kept their burning arms flying , and more winged creatures flew free of the crates .\nHundreds of tiny bodies with white wings flew with blinding speed up from the mountain as it began to turn a terrifying blue-white .\nThey flew into the sky \u2013 up beyond the yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creatures paused in their flight , turning their heads down towards the blinding white collapsing mountain .\nAs one , they flew up as a shockwave blasted up from the massive new crater that was rapidly swallowing countless tons of rock and rubble .\nTheir white wings whirring faintly , the creatures hovered over the groaning earth , above the mushroom cloud of the former mountain .\nThe creatures looked down for a long while , then looked at each other .\nTheir blonde hair and blue eyes shone vividly in the rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an electric pause , and then \u2013 as one \u2013 the creatures raised their blue eyes to the tiny white dot high in the sky , just below the midnight meridian that was slowly swallowing the remaining stars above .\nAgain as one , the creatures \u2019 wings began to beat faster , and they rose like an eerie reverse snowfall .\nWeapons appeared in their tiny pink hands as they flew like a narrow blown blizzard towards the weapon that had destroyed their masters .\nIt was the beginning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe Angels had arrived to save mankind\u2026", "author": "Stefan Molyneux", "url": "https://www.freedomain.com/2022/07/16/12243/", "published": "Sun, 17 Jul 2022 00:39:48 +0000",

stand and swear ?\nDid you kneel beside it ?\nOr smile at your height ?\nWhen weariness leaned against you Or did you fear wrinkles ?\nWhen you fell from exhaustion Did you rise with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mirror of never ?\nOr did you spark and spit ?\nDid you learn these lessons ?\nIt is of thee I sing !\nOr dressing for the couch I think in pastels now And think before I speak I do not grudge my

to be broken .\nHere and now As they wander the cremation We pass to these stretching hands And say your children died For want of a free flow of capital .\nWhat gave us life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means to man \u2019 s intelligence But we fed freedom to secular management And cursed the poor with borrowed blessings .\nHaving torn our chains from the walls Stalin you must believe It was not what you smoked or ate or did That did you in But the failure of the shabby hordes Shamed only by the roses Your heart was in the right place Even if no-one else \u2019 s was .\nI want to kneel and weep for all mankind For not being equal to your vision For you saw like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopeful .\nStill With Us Are still remembered at the embassy Coming as they did In the arc of the Depression Chief trumpeters in the orchestra of gore They gushed their notes to the conductor \u2019 s wand Reflecting his scepter in their ruby glasses .\nThey cried through the metal of their speared sausages

make .\nWe ask why We cry why not ?\nSky-tumbling to far fields of new wheat Her hair a whore \u2019 s-nest of pollen and warm breeze Long vines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cellar with hot scent .\nBlowing my snow into flurries of butterflies .\nI wallowed in the folds of her gown Stalked her with lilies and daisy-chains And played to her my begging birds .\nDid she promise to stay ?\nAnd when autumn

reflected perfection of heaven .\nWhen women came they scattered like pebbles Weighed her with paintings and pages of books When tall men came they were taught to bear fruit Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces

rock .\nIn search of their emperor \u2019 s clothing Their kite-lines spearing the eye of God Like telephone-poles in a stream of motion Strung from the angels who dip and shout , seasick and giddy .\nThey soar , straining their ropes , their wings flashing mightily Weighed to the earth by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necks hanging below A Tourist in the Eye of God And rising faster than thought could find Flew headlong into the eye of God And turned it on the rise of Man .\nThey hauled on the ropes of mankind \u2019 s well Jerking us up from our beds of heather .\nScratching our hides we barked with surprise As we lifted our heads to scan the skies The first mute beasts to lift up our eyes And damned among those who never ask why .\nScalded by thunder and lit by rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We clasped our heads in helpless pain For the source of the sound was no longer our ears .\nWe fled to our caves , but it wasn \u2019 t enough The burning skies cried out for a name For the angels had pulled us up from our trough And we screamed in fear as the skies came again .\nWhen one of us cried a singular sound The thunder softened and blew away We lowered our heads and gathered around In thanks that he

eaten was pregnant in fact So we thought it a useful point of tact To have a little sacrifice .\nSoon it got too complex for words This , that , it got hard to tell He ate a boar while looking at birds Our only question was : who was to blame For failing to cause the required effect ?\nFights and visions ; soon the time came When ordering it all required an elect .\nWe surrendered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the group who had come up with the most We little knew they would soon be the cause Of turning our best and our brightest to toast .\nAs soon as we gave them the power they said There is no more wisdom for you to acquire We were silent and shocked , being born and bred To question the world , and knowledge admire .\nBut soon it became abundantly clear The price we had paid for certainty Those who obeyed became very dear And the rest all became inflammatory .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap Though we scowl at the depths of the angel \u2019 s treason Our children grow up unable to weep And the rest of us scrabble in search of reason .\nSometimes I sit and think of the woods Where the angels freed us from ignorant cages And shooed our desires with \u201c mustn \u2019 ts \u201d and \u201c should \u2019 s \u201d Surely one of our sorriest stages .\nFor now I know the sky is only the sky The clouds care nothing for our incantation And by praying for power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to imagination .\nGift of the Given But if God should say If you burn your legs , teeth and heart They would snarl at the sky And lick the earth their life .\nAnd we lick alone The world is the Word made flesh The

there be ?\nTheir freedom is not freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their courts are always feasting .\nA gap in the spokes of wheels in motion .\nWhy should we hunt them ?\nThat sometimes a flight to their distant songs To dream in midsummer ( it is always midsummer ) Yes -- when the exception proves the rule And rest is a cure for eventful labour But for some the elves beckon from cliffs And the cracks of men widen , eating their senses In the face of freedom to lie it dies And dreamers wake from feasts only to despise For these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with wings Are more family than blood And the faeries of duty Free from the rods of absolutes They race around with butterfly nets New gods sprouting from their eager eyes .\nThey ignore the closing shutters of greatness And never hear the earth begin to groan To what do I owe my parents ?\nThis sort of poem can be very short We have seen shelter , food and water Yet we ask no gratitude From the victims of obligation No more than we ask that they honour Or return to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whom it may concern And divorce the flesh beyond the image .\nThus the obligation lies upon Beaching on powder from a sea of scent .\nOf a waterfall , rises to her neck Barefoot in daring and tickled by noses She laughs at the breath of kisses on toes .\nBy the blood of the painters below her windows Her youth is forever for those who daub .\nShe walks in wide twilight alone Armed with the ghosts of passion and space\u2026 While on the canvasses of the thinning crowd Scales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rises , smooth as the sun And heats without humming the water

years Friends , to whom worth is breath -- Listen to the savage indemnity of endless tribute The kindest kiss of the harshest master : You are to be commended Yet in this bright athletic world Do you wish to be a triumph of tremors ?\nWhere is your pride ?\nThis eternal gasping for given air\u2026 I am the smile of your pure soul The smile which gently says : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This only hotel is only

possible lives Perhaps they are impatient Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the alphabet of abasement : C is for cowardice N is for never Can we see them shudder and slam these pages ?\nCan we hear their response to the question : Can we hear their bitter refusal ?\nEven if they are told to turn to \u201c T \u201d And there they read : Is it enough ?\nThis an allegory of every moment This alphabet is the song of every breath : What is the meaning of life ?\nCan we see the foolishness ?\nIf your world is mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can rob life of luxury ?\nWhy , are we not the endless echoes of our first hearings ?\nWe are born as single seeds in a single garden If we are sown with bitterness , despair , hatred , violence Or merely unwatered with love We become small shoots among towering vines We lurk in jungles of endless struggle And our desire to give up the fight Our lives become a strain of single will Our pleasures the conquering of endless impossibilities Our purpose not life , but survival\u2026 In this agony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhaustion can turn from a hated enemy So , you say , take this ease !\nRest , rest -- you have earned it !\nYou see , we are not struggling The vines grow ; we must always strive We are watched by predators ; You say : there are no predators !\nI reply : years ago , you were taught to read You are not literate ; you became literacy You say there are no

all that is left Quicksand is the Only Struggle I have had it !\nCast in air too rare for despair Tainted with the breath of others Past all I was before Strange now , how this shedding of the mortal earth Should so have blinded me !\nAnd rising through the endless shades Sung to by the siren of all-sight I began to yearn for an end to eyes .\nI am shocked how close I came These folds freed only by circulation From so far , so high And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see that the fear of pain Was my only height .\nOh these faint dreams of solid earth !\nYou say the strangeness of this fall Is not that it occurred But that it seems strange\u2026 Come , you say You are the thirty side of twenty-five Will you be the still side of life Before you recognize who you are ?\nHow you mutter of strangeness

Come ; we shall visit his lair And see the writing on his walls : Enough alone , enough alone\u2026 He spins in an endless wind Both trying to lead The beast cries : let me trust !\nHow long can this last ?\nI read of a boy who , though beaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feathers .\nHe is hard , impatient , intolerant , almost rude But his cheeks are red ; he slaps his thighs His blows were not his downfall He was a rigged ship in the midst of storms He moved in his flailing wind\u2026 I thought that the blows were all that tore my sails ; In talking , in listening , in speaking I know I was not hated .\nThe prickly indifference of the hollow heart That was the truest , harshest blow Just the apathy of the dead Nor found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime of all youth ; Young hearts scald the walls of old fear Not wanted , but kept See the old teacher Stitches new beasts from old hides He has become a professor See the old teacher He no longer travels ; so He must slam all opening suitcases And recite the dangers of foreign lands .\nHe has many brothers In a still city besieged by doubt They can only resist .\nWhat lies beyond these rusted gates These high walls of old habits Out on the plains.. ?\nLet us look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see an equality of birds and herds The principles of flight their only destination The method of wind their only flight .\nIn this clutter of certainty There are no parasites One mounts not others Ring out from all heights ; There is no hierarchy But the last melody .\nThis is the view the still city repels The still city is not age And the waking old are sometimes flung from parapets The key to the still city Beat and squawk in fear and rage .\nShe shields her small soul from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a cave within a cave .\nThree tears she drops before leaving And vows to her soul : I will return\u2026 At the party she stands She sits holding , staring ; the words flow and fade\u2026 She feels like a miner failing in bad air She falls in the soft fogs of an endless beach\u2026 Here ; see my sister -- See -- there is now a hardness Here in the dark halls Sitting , her hand pressed to her heart She feels the slow sagging of herself The enduring death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign word : Above , the world has changed Children cry of the pleasure of life Her beautiful lover cries for her We cry , we wonder : Can she hear us ?\nWe are patient in love .\nListen to the

they could not hold him all .\nStill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , they could not hold him all .\nStill , they could not hold him all .\nAt the end , panting with horror And they with him Where human ash hung in bags on the walls And the old were elbowed in the scrabble for bread .\nThat I had escaped this ; I thought I would write a portrait of myself I shied away from my pen That none of me stands alone Nothing is firm ; nothing holds ; I am an eternity of moments .\nSeems a frantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved ones .\nI rise , greet others and others A kite with will for legs Do you see ?\nNothing stays where it is ; Only now do I have the courage To gaze below my curled toes To a whirlpool of vacuum and old cries I look , and fear my will , my tyrant .\nHe holds these wars at bay with sharp dogs ; What could that mean ?\nI had to love what I hated Do you reach to feel me ?\nDo your fingers stretch in vain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , I will forever be Can it be undone ?\nThere can be no amputations My

\u201d shuddered she , as he snored .\nSwallowing the shock of such echoes .\nIn an explosion of innards The clear wonder of unfolding trust It kneeled before me ; I rose I was above it Above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Above the risk of spoken passion Above the surrender of slow love What -- now -- to be normal ?\nAhh -- how these badges tear in the taking-off !\nEach medal like a pin in a cushion An armour

are not so easily shattered .\nPain is also the vanity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fearful distance .\nIt is human to recoil And , I now see How could they tell ?\nNo , but where they once resided They found themselves , not evicted They could caress her ornaments But she was gone .\nThey shot her looks like nets Wound her in webs of frowns They were not even trampolines How could she go ?\nShe was a always painted figure She one shone over their dry landscape Glanced at her over caving hulls And on that high rock They ran their fingers over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a foundation\u2026 Come to church !\nthey cried Their words like snaking hooks at her flying trail Come to the meeting !\nCome to help Be with us She walked from the cliff and danced They could not fathom her She scorned the courts of freedom Laughed at the gavels of abandon They did not help She did not see them .\nHer sometimes husband followed her He followed her to a wood He followed her the leafy hand on her cheek the woods , the wilds , the endless words\u2026 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our loves And hold our self Her husband saw her Not apologies and a stripped self And when she raised her head At the leaves , the heat And the

tremble ; She is finding her rising Becoming it , for she loves , this woman Her heart is caged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadows of pillars She is a volcano of waiting Oh this woman -- you should know her As I know her !\nShe is a paradox of passion A whirlwind of now and never .\nQuick -- see her above See -- she flies forever in search of soft earth ; She can fly over a lush green opening of arms She feels the heat of the leaves on her cheek And hungers for the rest of the rising earth But at the prick of a branch -- she flies Ah -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stillness is always a watching But at times -- at times she surges She mounts the crest of fear ; Horse and rider become one And then -- the deep thunder !\nThe bright unfurling of her light soul !\nThen you would see her As I see her As she is Some
