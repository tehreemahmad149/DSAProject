[VIDEO]", "content": "Is Nancy Pelosi caught off guard and retaliate with anger ?\nNancy Pelosi angrily disputed claims Wednesday that she has been using the U.S. Capitol Police ( USCP ) created as her own secret spy agency to probe political enemies after a Republican legislator made scathing allegations against her on Tuesday .\nWhen asked about the reports that Capitol Police had been investigating members of Congress and their offices at her request on Feb. 9 , Pelosi snapped at a reporter .\n\u201c Don \u2019 t waste your time , \u201d she said .\n\u201c I have no power over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that ?\n\u201d \u201c The Capitol Police have responded to that gentleman \u2019 s allegation and that stands as what it is , \u201d the speaker continued .\n\u201c But I have no power over the police.\n\u201d Texas \u2019 s Republican Congressman Troy Nehls released a series of tweets revealing the Capitol Police illegally investigating his office on Tuesday .\nRep. Nehls , a vocal critic of the partisan hack January 6th Committee and of the shooting death of Air Force veteran Ashli Babbitt , tweeted : \u201c The @ CapitolPolice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one of my staffers caught them in the act .\nOn November 20th , 2021 , Capitol Police entered my office without my knowledge and photographed confidential legislative products protected by the Speech and Debate clause enshrined in the Constitution , Article 1 Section 6 .\nTwo days later , on Monday , November 22 , 2021 ( Thanksgiving week ) , three intelligence officers attempted to enter my office while the House was in recess .\nUpon discovering a member of my staff , special agents dressed like construction workers began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a photograph taken illegally two days earlier .\n@ CapitolPolice never informed myself or senior-level staff of their investigation , and the reasons are clear .\nThey had no authority to photograph my office , let alone investigate myself or members of my staff .\nSo , why is the Capitol Police Leadership maliciously investigating me in an attempt to destroy me and my character ?\nMaybe it is because I have been a vocal critic of @ SpeakerPelosi , the @ January6thCmte , and @ CapitolPolice leadership about their handling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Babbitt , and the subsequent SHAM investigation .\nAccording to a news release from the lawmaker \u2019 s office , the first incident occurred on November 20 , 2021 , when a USCP officer allegedly noticed an unsecured door on Nehls \u2019 congressional office .\nA white board with information about \u201c a pro-law enforcement bill that would have ensured body armor quality for law enforcement officers \u201d was found inside the congressman \u2019 s office , and the officer proceeded to snap photos of the secret materials that were found inside .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chain at USCP , intelligence analysts filed a report alleging \u201c strange writings \u201d found in the GOP congressman \u2019 s office , which sparked worry and prompted an investigation , according to Nehls \u2019 office .\nNehls , on the other hand , claims that he was never informed that there was a probe investigating him or his staff .\nThree USCP officers masquerading as construction workers tried to get into Nehls \u2019 office again two days later , while Congress was off on Thanksgiving holiday and most offices were empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2021 , the officers came upon a staff member who was on duty .\nAccording to the press release , the cops began questioning the employee about the contents of the white board .\nIn a report by The Federalist , the white board had a brainstorm session regarding laws limiting the purchase of Chinese body armor .\nFrom the Nehls \u2019 office , the list was created in response to a story in The Washington Post about a Texas federal contractor who deceived the US government by giving them with Chinese-made body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The list put underneath the words \u201c body armor \u201d that included references to export administration regulations dealing with Chinese imports and U.S. imports was kept out of the police report concerning the \u201c strange scribbling \u201d on Nehl \u2019 s whiteboard .\nAs per The Federalist , the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) has requirements for ballistic equipment .\n\u201c If Capitol Police leadership had spent as much time preparing for January 6 as they spent investigating my white board , the January 6 riot never would have happened , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a patrol officer responding to a call , I didn \u2019 t have the time or authority to go rifling through someone \u2019 s personal papers .\nThere are serious 4th Amendment , constitutional issues at play here.\n\u201d One Republican congressional staffer who does not work for Nehls told The Federalist that since Jan. 6 , 2021 , Pelosi has used Capitol Police as her own personal mercenaries instead of focusing on the security failures that let the Capitol riot occur .\n\u201c Instead of fixing the obvious problems with Capitol security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excuse to create her own personal Praetorian Guard , \u201d the aide said .\nPelosi , however , claims that Capitol Police are not under her control .\nNow , several Republican leaders have written a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , and Committee on House Administration Chairwoman Zoe Lofgren , urging them to investigate these reports of Capitol Police monitoring lawmakers and citizens .\nThis letter also indicates that the Capitol Police have also been \u201c monitoring the online activity of congressional staff and individuals who meet with Members of Congress.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed to look for information on donors and staff \u2018 that would cast a member in a negative light , \u2019 \u201d the letter reads .\n\u201c If true , these allegations are serious violations of Americans \u2019 civil rights and civil liberties .\nOur constituents have the right to petition Congress and they should be able to exercise this right without fear that Capitol Police will scrutinize their property taxes , social media , or relationships.\n\u201d Arizona Rep. Andy Briggs gave Fox News Digital a statement on the letter , saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capitol Police are surveilling Members of Congress , Congressional staff , and their Capitol visitors.\n\u201d \u201c If these reports are true , \u201d Briggs said , \u201c that the Capitol Police force is actively looking for and reviewing private information , then this is a gross violation of American civil liberties and an abuse of power .\nI \u2019 m calling on Speaker Pelosi and Chairwoman Lofgren to do what is best for the American people and look into this troubling report.\n\u201d On Fox News \u2019 \u2018 Tucker Carlson Tonight \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation , saying , \u201c They \u2019 re weaponizing these federal law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies .\n\u201d",

Service \u201c protectee \u201d listed on the official timeline .\nThe start of the revised story that can be found , that has Kamala at the DNC , first appeared in Politico on January 6th , 2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn case you were not aware the RNC AND the DNC were the scenes of two supposed pipe bombs on January 6th .\nThen-Vice President-elect Kamala Harris was inside Democratic National Committee headquarters on Jan. 6 , 2021 , when a pipe bomb was discovered outside the building , according to four people familiar with her movements that day .\nCapitol Police began investigating the pipe bomb at 1:07 p.m. , according to an official Capitol Police timeline of events obtained by POLITICO .\nThe timeline says that Capitol Police and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d at approximately 1:14 p.m , seven minutes later .\nThe four people , among them a White House official and a former law enforcement official , confirmed that Harris was the Secret Service protectee identified in the timeline , which has circulated on Capitol Hill .\nOk , that is all well and good but there is something very suspicious about this and Tucker Carlson also feels the same way .\nFirst , Tucker is wanting to know why Kamala didn \u2019 t use this in her speech on January 6 ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ this piece of news to speak to the people , right ?\nWhy would Harris not reveal she was that close to a \u201c bomb \u201d ?\nThat would have been a very powerful statement to make , right ?\nEspecially a woman who compared 1/6 to 9/11 and Pearl Harbor .\nBut she didn \u2019 t say a word .\nIt would \u2019 ve been the perfect moment for Kamala Harris to tell us that she herself came within mere feet of a racist insurrectionist bomb .\n\u201c They literally tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine Kamala Harris saying that .\nThis is a person who puts herself at the center of every story , who invent stories in order to put herself at the center .\nThis is the person who told us she was at a civil rights protest as

there are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning the entire \u201c investigation \u201d too .\nThe supposed \u201c pipe bomber \u201d has eluded the FBI .\nThis \u201c master criminal \u201d caught wearing

arrest the suspect who planted these bombs .\nI find that incredibly odd and so does Tucker .\nHere is more from Wayne Dupree : Tucker concluded his delve into this bizarre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bombs , especially now that Kamala is in the mix .\nTucker wondered if a random Trump supporter would have some insider knowledge on where Kamala Harris was going that day .\nThe FBI said there were no \u201c coordinated \u201d groups working on January 6th , so it \u2019 d have to be a random Trump supporter , right ?\nThat seems like a hard pill to swallow , given that her political buddies didn \u2019 t even know where she was .\nIt is fair to assume that if Kamala @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DNC when she went , the pipe bomb would not have been discovered just minutes before the insurrectionist breach at the Capitol .\nIn other words , if Kamala Harris hadn \u2019 t been there , the bomb couldn \u2019 t have been the diversion that the Capitol Police Department said it was .\nIt \u2019 s all pretty mysterious actually , and maybe the weirdest [ thing ] of all is that the FBI has only released 3 minutes of the video showing the person who planted the bomb .\nWhy not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on here , there \u2019 s no question about that , because the story doesn \u2019 t make any sense .\nThe FBI can hunt down some random granny who was walking through the Capitol with her flag and fanny pack , but

Well , and this is going to be an issue Congress takes up this week .\nI know the President said more action is coming , but this has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply chain issues already .\nThen you have the

information to him ?\nHe said , if we \u2019 d been better mind readers , I guess we could have done something earlier .\nBUTTIGIEG : Well , look , the administration acted from day one after the recall .\nTaking steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program to help rebalance the availability of formula in the States .\nThere are more actions that are underway , including looking at imports .\nBut fundamentally , we are here because a company was not able to guarantee that its plant was safe .\nAnd that plant has shut down .\nBRENNAN : But that is the federal government \u2019 s job as regulators to help ensure safety of the plant- SECRETARY BUTTIGIEG : As regulators , yes .\nBut let \u2019 s be very clear .\nThis is a capitalist country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formula , nor should it .\nCompanies make formula .\nAnd one of those companies , a company which , by the way , seems to have 40 % market share , messed up and is unable to confirm that a plant , a major plant , is safe and free of contamination .\nSo the most important thing to do right now , of course , is to get that plant in Michigan up and running safely .\nAnd that \u2019 s the work that \u2019 s going on between the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to be safe and it \u2019 s got to be up and running as soon as possible .\nBut this is the difference between a supply chain problem , in other words , a problem about moving goods around , and a supply problem which has to do with whether they \u2019 re being produced in the first place .\nNow , the administration \u2019 s also been working with other companies to try to surge their production .\nThat \u2019 s led to an increase in production , which is helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day , this plant needs to come back online safely .\nMARGARET BRENNAN : And we \u2019 ll have more on that later in the show .\nBut because I know you \u2019 re not the FDA commissioner , let me talk to you about the things you are involved more in , which is supply chain procurement .\nHow is the administration making sure that those essential ingredients that are actually required for something like formula are actually available ?\nSECRETARY BUTTIGIEG : So a shortage of ingredients is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facility\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN : No , it is a factor that has led to price .\nInflation is one of the factors among many that has been blamed for months of problems with baby formula even

re bringing it in from Europe right now .\nSECRETARY BUTTIGIEG : Right .\nBut that \u2019 s because .\nAgain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 90 % of the formula in this country which we should probably take a look at- SECRETARY BUTTIGIEG : Yeah , I mean , it \u2019 s-it \u2019 s basically a series of monopolies that have added up into enormous market concentration .\nBy the way , this is an issue the president has been talking about in area after area after area , whether we \u2019 re talking about fertilizer , whether we \u2019 re talking about other things in our agriculture sector\u2013

disagreed on what methods were the most useful in achieving the ideals that the Founding Fathers laid out in the Constitution .\nHowever , both parties agreed that the Constitution was an extremely important document that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was Tuesday when President Joe Biden made it clear that he no longer holds this to be true , with the six most horrifying words ever .\nIt was following Supreme Court Justice Steven Breyer \u2019 s retirement when Biden was meeting with the Senate Judiciary Committee to discuss this newly-opened seat on the Supreme Court .\n\u201c There \u2019 s always a renewed national debate every time we nominate\u2026any president nominates a justice , because the Constitution is always evolving slightly , in terms of additional rights or curtailing rights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now go back and read that again , paying close attention to these words : \u201c the Constitution is always evolving slightly.\n\u201d This is the Preamble to the US Constitution , This is a statement from Biden that represents the tremendous disparity between leftists and conservatives in 2022 .\nIt is this belief from far-left liberals that could lead to some problems , because conservatives believe the Constitution is unchanging and non-negotiable .\nThe ideals laid out in this document are the very ones that define who we are as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antonin Scalia was probably the best to articulate this position and what is wrong with it in 2017 , according to Fox News .\n\u201c The Constitution is not a living organism , \u201d Scalia said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a legal document , and it says what it says and doesn \u2019 t say what it doesn \u2019 t say.\n\u201d Yes , when the Constitution was ratified in 1788 , America was still yet to live up to the ideals that the founders had expressed .\nThe main example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is even probable today that there are certain areas of the Constitution that are not completely fulfilled .\nHowever , this is not the point that President Biden is making .\nInstead of saying that the United States of America may have work to do to live up to the Constitution , he is saying that this centuries-old document can be changed to fit his own view of what America can be .\nYep .\nBig problems here .\nThere were some Twitter users who asserted that the U.S. Constitution is an \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but yet again , that is not what President Biden is trying to do here .\nThese arguments represent a misunderstanding of Biden \u2019 s words .\nThe University of Chicago Law School notes that the idea of a \u201c living Constitution \u201d means the document \u201c evolves , changes over time , and adapts to new circumstances , without being formally amended.\n\u201d That is what Biden is saying here .\nWhen he says the Constitution is \u201c evolving , \u201d he does not mean that it can be amended , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be seen differently as the world continues to change .\nMake no question about it , this is based on the leftist view of the world where they believe that objective truth does not exist .\nIn the mind of a leftist , \u201c truth \u201d can be changed over time and can be
