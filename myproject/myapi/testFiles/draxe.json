regardless of whether the meat was beef or mutton .\nMutton is meat from sheep that \u2019 s around 3 years old versus lamb meat is usually around one year old .\nAs you can imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much less expensive than lamb .\nAccordingly , this common dish comes from the sheep country of northern England and Scotland .\nshepherd \u2019 s pie , common and inexpensive British dish originating from

if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this classic dish , then by all means .\nI \u2019 d recommend you try mashed sweet potatoes for the topping , or Yukon Gold potatoes .\nSweet potatoes are loaded with nutrition .\nThey contain a good amount of fiber as well as vitamin A , vitamin C , manganese and several other vitamins and minerals .\nSimply bring a pot of water to boil , add some salt , and then add peeled potatoes ( around 4 pounds , which is about 7 mid-sized potatoes ) .\nReduce the heat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are tender , about 10 minutes .\nDrain well , then put the potatoes back in the pot .\nMash them

\u2019 s time to get the gravy going !\nThis is my favorite part of shepherd \u2019 s pie and this version doesn \u2019 t disappoint .\nIn a medium pot , add the stock , cauliflower , onion , salt and pepper .\nLeave it uncovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nLet that simmer happen for 10 minutes .\nThen toss in the fresh thyme , rosemary and garlic and remove from the heat .\nLet the mixture cool a bit and then , in a high-powered blender , add Worcestershire sauce and butter , then pour the stock mixture you just made over it .\nPur\u00e9e it all up until it \u2019 s nice and smooth , then add in the digestion friendly arrowroot starch and pur\u00e9e again .\nIt \u2019 s amazing how creamy the cauliflower makes this gravy , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrowroot starch is great at thickening the sauce up .\nMmm .\nNow , take the gravy mix from the blender and pour it evenly over the filling in the baking dish .\nThen , take your faux-tatoes and spread them on top of the gravy .\nHow great does this

!\nGarnish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have and serve .\nWhile this might not be a 30-minute meal , this shepherd \u2019 s pie is worth the extra effort .\nIt makes a delicious Sunday dinner and the leftovers
