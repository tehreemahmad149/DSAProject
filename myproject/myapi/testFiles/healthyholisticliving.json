Here\u2019s What the Virus Does to Your Central Nervous System", "content": "Flu brain is a thing .\nAnd this season especially , everyone \u2019 s trying to avoid it .\nAnd no , you aren \u2019 t imagining it .\nPeople really are throwing you side-eye when you cough , sneeze or sniffle in public .\nNobody wants the flu .\nYou likely know the symptoms all too well .\nBut did you ever wonder what havoc these viruses play inside of the body , particularly the brain ?\nAnd although this flu season started off slowly , it \u2019 s spreading quickly now , making this information more important than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s just really cool info .\nWhen it comes to colds and the flu , the cause of infection is often unknown .\nWas it little Susie ?\nOr the doorknob at work ?\nWhat comes next though , is all too familiar .\nThe coughing , the sore throat , brain fog , crankiness , fatigue , stuffy nose , and aches .\nThis is known collectively as sickness behavior .\nCold and flu symptoms are often grouped together but the two can have some distinct differences .\nBoth the cold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose , sneezing , sore throat pain and coughing , but the flu virus is characterized by an accompanying fever , headache , exhaustion and general body aches and pains .\nAs you lay there , unable to function or move properly , as haziness takes over your brain , you may be wondering , \u201c What is happening inside of my head ?\n\u201d This is what I like to call \u201c flu brain.\n\u201d To understand the effects a virus has on your brain , AKA flu brain , you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immune system sets off when it senses a pathogen .\nThe body \u2019 s response to being infiltrated by any kind of foreign substance causes the immune system to become activated .\nThe immune system is the defense mechanism to prevent an infection or pathogen from getting out of control and causing serious damage to the body .\nThe invasion : Initially , the virus invades the cells of the host to remain undetected by the immune system as it replicates , thereby increasing its chances of survival .\nDespite this act of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to determine whether a cell is behaving appropriately or not .\nA group of molecules , class 1 major histocompatibility complex proteins ( MHC class 1 ) , naturally display pieces of itself from the inside of the cell onto the cell surface .\nCells infected with the virus will have MHC class 1 cells with fragments of the virus exposed on the cell surface .\nThis causes a cascade of events to occur to eradicate pathogens from the body .\nAlong with the virus being partially exposed on the cell surface , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signaling proteins , that cause neighboring cells to increase the MHC class 1 presentation on their cell surface to draw more attention to the virus .\nRecognition and defense : The immune system has several types of white blood cells roaming around , policing the body searching for foreign objects to find and destroy .\nThe white blood cells include , but are not limited to : The natural killer cells find the virus-infected cells displaying the lower levels of MHC class 1 molecules and release more substances to induce cell death .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of T cell , cytotoxic T cell , will recognize the virally infected cell due to the part of the virus exposed on the cell surface .\nFrom there , it releases cytotoxic factors to \u201c kill \u201d the infected cell .\nFollowing viral identification , cytotoxic T cells also synthesize and release cytokines .\nCytokines are pro-inflammatory , antibody proteins that activate and organize that immune response to a viral infection by acting upon cell receptors causing a cascade of intracellular signaling that leads to alterations in gene expression and ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response and the brain : The symptoms of a cold and flu are the physical manifestations of the immune response to the viral infection .\nSymptoms of fever and fatigue , along with a decrease in appetite , motivation , mood , psychomotor function and concentration , are all due to the release of cytokines within different regions of the brain .\nNeurotransmitters : When it comes to flu brain , neurotransmitters play a huge role .\nAn immune system response in the central nervous system causes a significant effect on the synthesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cytokines activate a pathway which depletes a precursor to some of the neurotransmitters , decreasing their synthesis , release and reuptake .\n( 2 ) The decrease in dopamine and serotonin affect learning and memory as well as \u201c feel good \u201d sensations , leaving a somewhat saddened state .\nA noradrenaline decrease causes a slowing in reaction time , and choline effects the ability to remember new information , while glutamate decrease affects muscle .\nThe decrease in neurotransmitters also impacts the neural circuits within specific regions of the brain .\nNeural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cingulate cortex , amygdala , hippocampus are impacted .\nThese regions are associated with motor activity , motivation , anxiety , arousal , alarm and memory .\n( 3 ) Hypothalamus : Within the hypothalamus ( the region that regulates body temperature , hunger , thirst as well as other autonomic functions ) cytokine release provokes alterations in normal homeostatic functions to try to rid the body of the virus .\nGenerally , there is an increase in temperature , a fever , an increase in sleep and a decrease in appetite .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to create an environment that is not conducive to viral replication , while the increase in sleep allows the body to devote most of its energy on fighting the virus instead of focusing its energy on wakeful tasks .\nResearch by Dr. Marken Nedergaard ; a professor of neurosurgery at the University of Rochester , shows that cerebral spinal fluid washes away proteins that build up in the space between brain cells during the day .\nThis process is even more crucial as the body fights an infection and is dealing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be removed from the spaces between neurons .\nEssentially , all of this debris can act to obstruct or slow normal metabolic function and can attribute to the \u201c foggy headed \u201d feeling .\n( 5 ) Cognition : The effects of the pro-inflammatory immune response on cognition and mood are a decrease in mental processing , learning and a depressed state .\nMuch like alcohol or sleep deprivation , seasonal illness impairs cognition by dampening reaction times and the ability to store new information .\n( 6 ) In one study , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tested for cognition .\nA few months later , one-third of the participants had head colds and were tested again , with the healthy participants remaining as controls .\nWhen compared to previous baseline score , individuals with head colds took longer to learn new things and to perform verbal reasoning tasks as well as retrieve information .\n( 7 ) The cognitive impairment started 24 to 48 hours prior to other symptoms and lasted a few days following the stoppage of coughing and sneezing .\nImpairment with the flu lasted several weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 students took simulated driving tests on two different occasions .\nDuring the first session , 15 students had a head cold , but not on the second session .\nThe results showed an impairment of reaction time , especially for unexpected events , although basic driving skills were not impaired .\n( 9 ) These studies have illustrated that inflammation is the key factor that links the immune , neurological and psychological systems causing the cognitive deficits of seasonal illness .\nUnfortunately , there isn \u2019 t much to be done as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHowever , there are some ways to help your body along and make you feel less foggy and more functional during your days of recuperation .\n1 .\nNever underestimate the power of positive thinking !\nStudies suggest that a positive outlook helps protect against seasonal illness or reduces the intensity of the symptoms , while stress undermines the immune system through cortisol release ( the stress hormone ) and makes your more susceptible to illness .\n( 10 ) 2 .\nSleep .\nSleep deprivation is a no-no when it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier , sleeping lets your body focus its energy on fighting the virus , allowing the body to wash away the waste products lodged in between your brain cells .\n3 .\nConsider caffeine .\nA 2014 study illustrated the benefits of caffeine , a stimulant , and ibuprofen , an anti-inflammatory .\nIndividuals were given either 200 milligrams of ibuprofen with 100 milligrams of caffeine or 200 milligrams of ibuprofen alone or 100 milligrams of caffeine alone or a placebo .\nThe groups were tested two times over a 3-hour period .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest improvement in reaction times .\nWhile I \u2019 m not big on using ibuprofen , the study also found some improvement with caffeine alone .\nSo a cup of coffee could perk you up during seasonal illness , if you can stomach it .\n( 11 ) 4 .\nTap flu-fighting oils .\nUse this guide to the best essential oils for colds , the flu and beyond to help support your body during seasonal illness .\n\u2022 Seasonal illnesses like colds and influenza activate the body \u2019 s immune system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as cytokines to keep pathogens under control .\n\u2022 This immune response impacts the brain and central nervous system tremendously .\n\u2022 It throws off normal neurotransmitter functioning , leading to everything from muscle pain and brain fog to symptoms of depression .\n\u2022 A cold can lead to impaired cognitive function for a few days ; the flu may cause weeks of cognitive dysfunction .\n\u2022
