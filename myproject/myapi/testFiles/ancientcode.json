month later , Bill Nelson has directed NASA to study UFOS ( or UAPs ) .\nNotably , the push comes as a much-anticipated UAP report is due to Congress .\nIn 1986 , Nelson flew on the 24th flight of the Space Shuttle Columbia , conducting 12 medical experiments .\nDuring a CNN interview with Rachel Crane , Nelson claimed that NASA doesn \u2019 t know what the authentic UFOs observed by Navy pilots and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s quickly leading scientific efforts into the phenomena .\n\u201c Well , I have talked to those Navy pilots , and they are sure that they saw something real , \u201d said

of which service or agency acquired the information.\n\u201d Nevertheless , it seems the report will likely be incomplete , delayed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent CIA document dump .\nNow , the Biden administration may decide to delay the report due to all the roadblocks .\nIn all likelihood , delaying the forthcoming report would only strengthen the public \u2019 s perception of a coverup .\nSuch perception would be entirely logical , given the long history of coverups , such as the decades of secret multimillion-dollar UFO study programs .\nAlso , recent public statements by Trump \u2019 s

former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christopher Mellon , the Air Force has denied access to information .\nAlso , a Navy-led Pentagon task force set up last August has few personnel or resources to gather any evidence .\nFurther , government bureaucracies are stymying the efforts , as one would expect .\nOn the other hand , Mellon notes that , in contrast , the \u201c tide is turning against the illogical

truth .\nSee Elizondo in the clip from Inside Edition : Even as decades of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainstream UFO acceptance , it \u2019 s clear that full disclosure at this time would be extremely unlikely .\nAlready , we can see that the June UAP report will withhold much from the public .\nAs Mellon said , even getting government agencies to agree on the language used will prove challenging .\nTherefore , we can all plan to continue searching for the truth after the UAP report comes out .\nIn all likelihood , the prevailing attitudes of stigma and secrecy will not just vanish like a UFO

answer may never be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts can be ascertained about Achilles .\nMany books and movies have been made about Achilles .\nHe is a popular character in fiction .\nHowever , there is very little known about his life .\nWhat is known about Achilles comes from ancient Greek mythology .\nA historian named Herodotus is one of the few sources of information on Achilles .\nHerodotus was a Greek historian who lived in the fifth century BC .\nHe wrote about the Persian Wars .\nIn his writings , he mentions Achilles .\nHerodotus claimed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thetis and that all his brave

hypothetical planets .\nIt extends from the orbit of Jupiter at 5.2 AU to the Kuiper belt at 50 AU .\nMany researchers believe there are undiscovered planets in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outer reaches .\nIn recent years , there has been growing interest in the possibility of a \u201d Planet X \u201d or \u201c Nibiru \u201d \u2013 a hidden planet orbiting our sun in the distant reaches of the outer solar system .\nTo unravel the mystery , we need to understand the background of this theory and the evidence that supports it .\nThis article will further explore the Planet Nibiru theory and try to answer some of the most frequently asked questions about it .\nWhat Are Dwarf Planets , And Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are familiar with the planets in our solar system : Mercury , Venus , Earth , Mars , Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus , and Neptune .\nBut there are three main types of planets : gas giants , terrestrial planets , and dwarf planets .\nA gas giant planet is a massive planet made mostly of hydrogen and helium .\nTerrestrial planets are small , solid worlds like Earth .\nDwarf planets are a new class of planets defined by the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) in 2006 .\nThey are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and often have irregular shapes .\nNibiru is sometimes referred to as a \u201c dwarf planet \u201d or \u201c mini-Neptune \u201d because it is thought to be a small , icy world similar to Neptune or Pluto .\nHowever , there is no scientific evidence to support the existence of Nibiru , and most astronomers believe that it does not exist .\nThe name \u201c Nibiru \u201d comes from the ancient Babylonian culture , where it was first mentioned in clay tablets written by priests around 1200 BCE .\nThe tablets described a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an orbital period of 3,600 years .\nThis planet was known as \u201c Marduk , \u201d \u201c Nibiru , \u201d or \u201c Planet X.\n\u201d In 2006 , the international astronomical union IAU created a new category of planets called \u201c dwarf planets.\n\u201d Pluto was the first world to be classified as a dwarf planet .\nFor a long time , there was debate over whether Pluto should be classified as a planet .\nMany astronomers believed that it was too small to be considered a planet .\nThe IAU \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an object that orbits the sun and has enough mass to assume a nearly round shape but has not cleared the neighborhood around its orbit .\nThis means that a dwarf planet has not gravitationally pulled in all the smaller objects ( asteroids , comets , etc . )\nthat are orbiting nearby .\nSince its discovery in 1930 , Pluto has

.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it would be so far away from Earth that it would be very faint and hard to see .\nIt would also move slowly across the sky , making it even more challenging to spot .\nThe hypothetical planet would also have a very long orbit , taking thousands or even millions of years to go around the sun once .\nThis would make it hard to find because its position would change significantly over time .\nOne scientist named John Matese from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette believes that Nibiru @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A brown dwarf is a type of star too small to fuse hydrogen in its core .\nThis means it would not be bright enough to be seen without a powerful telescope .\nThe distant objects found in the past few years , such as Sedna and 2012 VP113 , are considered brown dwarfs .\nMatese believes that there might be a brown dwarf orbiting our sun at a distance of about 100,000 times the Earth-sun distance .\nThis would put it far beyond Neptune \u2019 s orbit .\nHe has even calculated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predicted when it would next pass by Earth .\nMatese \u2019 s calculations show that Nibiru should be visible in our night sky sometime in 2046 .\nHowever , other

or get attention .\nThere is no scientific evidence to support the existence of Nibiru , and the idea is considered pseudoscience .\n10 Hidden Facts That Support The Existence of Planet Nibiru When we discuss the undiscovered planet Nibiru , we refer to a massive object that orbits our sun .\nIt is often called Planet X or Nemesis .\nThere are many hidden pieces of evidence to suggest that Nibiru exists , but the main 10 are listed below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there has been a lot of excitement about the possible existence of Planet Nine , a giant planet that may be lurking in the outer solar system .\nHowever , Nibiru is not Planet Nine .\nNibiru is a much larger object that would be easily visible in our night sky if it were there .\nPlanet nine and Nibiru have identical properties but are two different objects .\nOne of the most compelling evidence for Nibiru is that it appears to orbit our sun .\nThere are several theories about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most likely scenario is that Nibiru is a binary system consisting of two stars orbiting each other .\nThe missing planet , Nemesis , is considered the star in this binary system , but Nibiru is the brown dwarf .\nNibiru is estimated to be four times the size of Earth and twice the size of Jupiter .\nIt is so massive that it would have a substantial gravitational effect on the planets in our solar system .\nIf Nibiru were to pass by Earth , it would cause havoc on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause earthquakes , volcanic eruptions , and extreme weather conditions .\nNibiru takes approximately 3,600 years to orbit our own sun .\nThis is much longer than any known planet in our solar system .\nNibiru \u2019 s long orbit is one of the reasons why it is so difficult to find .\nThe outer planets in our solar system , such as Neptune and Pluto , have much longer orbits than Nibiru , but they are still easier to find because they are closer to our sun .\nNibiru Is In The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region of space beyond Neptune that is thought to contain comets and other icy objects .\nSome researchers believe that Nibiru is located in the Kuiper belt .\nThis would explain why it is so difficult to find .\nThe elusive planet would hide among the other Kuiper belt objects .\nOne of the most unusual things about Nibiru is that it appears to have a tail similar to a comet .\nThis tail is thought to be made up of dust and debris that has been pulled off of Nibiru by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is Bright In The Infrared Nibiru is much brighter in infrared than it is in visible light .\nThis is another indication that Nibiru is a binary system of two stars .\nThe bright infrared emissions are thought to be coming from the brown dwarf star in the system called planet X. Orbital eccentricity is a measure of how elliptical an orbit is .\nNibiru has a very high orbital eccentricity , which means that its orbit is very elongated .\nThis is another clue that Nibiru might be a binary system .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ collision course with Earth .\nIt is predicted to pass by our planet in 2029 , but some researchers believe it could happen sooner .\nNibiru \u2019 s approach would have disastrous consequences for our planet .\nThe massive object would cause earthquakes , tsunamis , and extreme weather conditions .\nSome researchers believe that Nibiru has already affected Earth .\nThey point out that more earthquakes and volcanic eruptions have occurred in recent years .\nThey also believe that Nibiru is responsible for the mass extinction of the dinosaurs .\nWhat Effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comes Too Close To Our Planet ?\nWe all know that the sun \u2019 s gravitational force affects any object in space .\nBut what if there was an object so massive that its gravity began to affect our solar system ?\nThat \u2019 s right ; we \u2019 re talking about the fabled \u201c Planet X , \u201d or Nibiru .\nSo , what effects could this planet have on Earth if it comes too close to our planet ?\nWell , for starters , the gravitational force of Planet X would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disrupt the orbit of Earth .\nThis would cause all sorts of problems for us , like drastic climate changes , as well as an increase in seismic activity .\nMany planetary scientists believe the destruction of the Earth is a genuine possibility if Nibiru were to come close enough to our planet .\nHowever , some scientists believe that Nibiru is nothing more than a myth .\nIn addition , the dust and debris that Planet X would kick up as it made its way through the solar system would devastate life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the sun , causing global cooling and potentially leading to a new ice age .\nThe Earth would also be bombarded by comets and asteroids drawn in by the gravity of Planet X .\nThis could potentially destroy all life .\nThere \u2019 s a reason why scientists are so interested in this planet , and it \u2019 s because the consequences of its existence are so destructive .\nThe living beings , humans and animals on earth , will have to face many problems if Nibiru comes close to our planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There would be drastic changes in climate , increased seismic activity , global cooling , and the destruction of all life on Earth .\nSo , while we don \u2019 t know if Planet X exists or if it will ever come close enough to Earth to have any real effect on our planet , it \u2019 s something to keep an eye on !\nWho knows , one day , we may find ourselves living in a very different solar system .\nReasons Why Scientists Believe Planet Nibiru Does Not Exist Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , One who believe in the existence of Planet Nibiru and another group of scientists who think otherwise .\nLet us see the reasons given by the second group why they think that Nibiru does not exist .\nNo One Has Seen It The most important point against the Nibiru cataclysm is that , as of now , no one has seen the planet .\nNancy Leveson first predicted it in 1983 ; stargazers have been trying to find it without success .\nAll the theories about its existence are based on calculations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen the planet .\nThe Planet Would Be Visible To The Naked Eye By Now If Nibiru were on its way toward Earth , it would be visible to the naked eye .\nIt would be so big and close that everyone could see it , yet there have been no reports of anyone seeing the planet .\nThere are no objects in the outer orbit that could be Nibiru .\nThe outer orbit is pretty empty , and we would have found it by now if there were a planet out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been found by now .\nModern Technology Does Not Support The Existence Of Nibiru There are no images or videos of Nibiru , even though there are now more cameras and telescopes than ever before .\nWe would have found it if the planet were out there .\nThe world \u2019 s space agencies are also adamant that there is no Planet X .\nIn today \u2019 s world , it is impossible to keep a planet hidden , especially one as big as Nibiru is supposed to be .\nNibiru @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nibiru were headed toward Earth , it would have affected the outer planets by now .\nIts gravity would have pulled them out of their orbits , and we would have seen changes in their orbits .\nBut there have been no changes in the outer planets \u2019 orbits , which suggests that there is no Planet X. Nibiru Can not explain the Tilt Of The Earth \u2019 s Axis Some people believe that the changing tilt of the Earth \u2019 s axis is due to the gravitational effects of Nibiru .\nHowever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tilt of the Earth \u2019 s axis is not changing .\nIt is the orbit of the Earth that is changing , which is due to the gravitational effects of the Sun and Moon .\nNo One Has Found Planet X In The Kuiper Belt There have been no sightings of Nibiru in the Kuiper Belt , which is where it is supposed to be .\nIf Nibiru were out there , someone would have found it by now .\nThe Absence Of A Second Sun Some people believe that when Nibiru @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be accompanied by a second sun .\nThis is because Nibiru is supposed to be a brown dwarf star .\nHowever , there has been no sighting of a second sun , which suggests that Nibiru does not exist .\nAll these reasons given by the second group of scientists make it pretty evident that Nibiru is just a myth and does not exist .\nStill , many researchers are working , and maybe in the future , they can find some evidence to prove the existence of Planet Nibiru .\nNibiru is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular culture .\nIt is sometimes called \u201c Planet X \u201d or \u201c Nemesis.\n\u201d In the 1996 science fiction film Independence Day , an alien spacecraft headed for Earth is referred to as \u201c the mothership.\n\u201d In the 2005 film The War of the Worlds , an invading force from Mars is referred to as \u201c the Martians.\n\u201d In the 2009 film 2012 , a rogue planet collides with Earth , causing worldwide destruction .\nNibiru has also been featured in several video games , including Spore ( 2008 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and No Man \u2019 s Sky ( 2016 ) .\nWhen Nibiru was first proposed , it was often compared to the fictional planet Krypton from the Superman comics and movies .\nThere are many doomsday scenarios surrounding Nibiru .\nSome believe that Nibiru will collide with Earth , causing widespread destruction .\nOthers think that Nibiru will pass close to Earth , causing the Earth \u2019 s poles to shift .\nThis will result in catastrophic weather conditions , such as floods and earthquakes .\nStill , others believe that Nibiru @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up our solar system .\nNibiru and Earth will be pulled into the Sun , destroying both planets .\nSome scientists also believe this is the end of the world as we know it .\nNibiru has also been linked to the Mayan calendar , which ends on December 21 , 2012 , but it did not happen .\nMany believe that Nibiru will appear in our sky on that date , causing widespread destruction .\nThere are many theories about Nibiru , a hypothetical planet known as Planet X .\nSome believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In contrast , others think it will pass by close enough to cause the Earth \u2019 s poles to shift .\nSome believe that this is when Nibiru will finally make its appearance .\nThere are even those who believe that Nibiru is already here and that it is causing strange weather patterns and natural disasters .\nWhether Nibiru exists or not , it has captured the imagination of people worldwide .\nIt is a topic of great interest and will continue to be debated for years .\nThe truth is , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Nibiru arrives .\nIt could be a harmless fly-by or the end of the world as we know it .\nOnly time will tell .\nMany researchers and hobbyists have become interested in the Nibiru conspiracy theory .\nThere are several theories about Nibiru , a hypothetical planet known as Planet X .\nThe conspiracy theories include : Mike Brown , a planetary scientist at Caltech , is one of the leading researchers on Nibiru .\nHe has been searching for the planet for over 10 years .\nIn 2012 , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Killed Pluto and Why It Had It Coming.\n\u201d In the book , Brown describes his search for the ninth planet in our solar system .\nHe also discusses the controversy surrounding Pluto \u2019 s demotion to a dwarf planet .\nBrown

Nibiru is an actual planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astronomers .\nRobertson has also written several articles about Nibiru , including \u201c Is Planet Nibiru Real ?\nThe Evidence Mounts.\n\u201d In the article , Robertson discusses several pieces of evidence that support Nibiru \u2019 s existence .\nDuring the IAU , Kevin Schindler gave a presentation about the possibility of Nibiru causing a pole shift .\nIn the presentation , he showed how the gravitational force of a giant planet like Nibiru could cause the Earth \u2019 s poles to shift .\nHe , Nora , and Mike present at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are available online .\nNo one today can say with 100 % certainty that the planet Nibiru exists .\nHowever , a growing body of evidence suggests it might be out there , waiting to be discovered .\nAstrologists , astronomers , and other researchers have all put forward compelling arguments for its existence .\nEven if Nibiru isn \u2019 t real , the possibility of its existence has led to some fascinating theories and discoveries about our solar system .\nThe search for Planet X continues , and who knows ?\nMaybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nUntil then , the debate rages on .\nWhat do you think ?\nIs

act of war that could have destroyed Rome itself had Octavian not been able to call up more ships from his nearby base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Octavian was Cleopatra \u2019 s alliance with Mark Antony .\nAfter

world , with Lepidus taking Africa , Antony the East , Octavian Rome , and the West .\nThis arrangement lasted until Lepidus was removed from power in 36 BCE .\nSoon after , Antony married Octavia Minor ( l. c. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister of Octavian , in an attempt to cement the peace between the two most powerful men in the world .\nNot only did Cleopatra refuse to attend the wedding ( which would
