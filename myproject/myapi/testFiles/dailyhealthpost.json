stubborn belly fat .\nMake sure you read till the end to learn ONE thing you can do before meals to lower post-meal glucose .\nHealthy oils and fats are key to good health .\nA diet rich in Omega-threes ( wild salmon , sardines ) , alpha-linolenic acid ( flaxseed , walnut ) , and monounsaturated fats ( olive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-inflammatory , and beneficial for our blood sugar and overall health .\nMany studies show that a Mediterranean-style diet reduces the risk of Type 2 diabetes and heart disease by up to 50 percent .\nRecent research suggests it is not cholesterol and saturated fats in our diets that contribute to heart attacks .\nBut a combination of high blood sugar and insulin from too much sugary and starchy foods , eating highly-processed inflammatory vegetable oils ( soybean , sunflower , corn , safflower , canola oil ) , as well as partially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , packaged snacks ) .\nStudies prove that consuming green leafy and cruciferous vegetables ( like cabbage , cauliflower , and spinach ) and drumstick leaves ( moringa ) can help lower the risk of type 2 diabetes .\nThis is attributed to their magnesium ( which reduces type 2 diabetes incidence ) and antioxidant content ( for example polyphenols , vitamin C , and beta-carotene ) , which help reduce systemic oxidative stress \u2014 a condition associated with numerous diabetes complications like heart disorders .\nWhile people with diabetes should avoid grains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to be cut off from their diet .\nDiabetes-safe grain products such as brown rice and whole-grain bread have been observed to improve the blood sugar of people living with diabetes .\nStudies show that consistent consumption of whole grains lowers your body mass index ( BMI ) , which subsequently reduces body weight .\nHow does bodyweight affect blood sugar ?\nFailure to manage your body weight worsens diabetes by increasing the risk of developing diseases associated with heart disease .\nWhole grains are high in fiber and help improve insulin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased blood sugar .\nResearch on these beverages has shown that drinking green tea will decrease glucose in your blood and improve diabetes control by promoting insulin sensitivity .\nThese effects are attributed to its epigallocatechin gallate ( EGCG ) content which promotes glucose uptake by skeletal muscles , reducing blood sugar levels .\nCoffee , caffeinated or decaffeinated , has similar effects .\nResearch indicates that drinking coffee lowers the risk of type 2 diabetes .\nOne plausible mechanism for this is its ability to promote weight loss , which helps manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its quinides and chlorogenic acid content .\nDark chocolate contains more cacao than milk chocolate , resulting in less severe effects on your blood sugar levels than regular chocolate .\nBut , how does it control diabetes ?\nMost research points towards an improvement in insulin resistance due to its flavonoid antioxidant content .\nThese compounds reduce inflammation , prevent cell damage , break down glucose in the body , and reduce oxidative stress , the primary cause of insulin resistance .\nThey \u2019 re also known to contain magnesium in significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels and promotes feelings of calm and relaxation .\nAlthough the sweet taste of berries like blueberries and strawberries can be confused with refined sugar that raises blood sugar , their effect is different .\nTreating yourself to strawberries or raspberries after a meal prevents your blood sugar from spiking and improves insulin secretion in overweight or obese people .\nMore insulin means more glucose is converted into glycogen , and by extension , reduced blood sugar levels .\nThis effect may be due to their anthocyanin polyphenol content , which has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflammation .\nCherries , on the other hand , have been observed to have unique effects on diabetes .\nWhen ingested , the anthocyanin content of these fruits may boost insulin production by up to 50 % .\nIn addition to this , their antioxidant properties are responsible for reducing the risk of diabetes complications like heart disease and kidney failure .\nAs a diabetes superfood , beans , such as pinto , lima , and green beans , provide a rich source of fiber and have a low glycemic index ( GI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat beans with any other food , white rice , for example , it \u2019 s more likely to prevent your blood sugar level from spiking than when you eat white rice alone , as studies suggest .\nFor one , they contain complex carbohydrates , which digest more slowly , keeping your blood sugar levels in check .\nAdditionally , their high fiber content slows down the rate of digestion , minimizing blood sugar spikes .\nTheir high protein content is also beneficial because it helps you stay full for more extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snacking and , by extension , excessive weight gain .\nAn excellent way to enjoy them is to sprinkle some cooked beans in your salad or add them to your sandwich or burgers .\nCitrus fruits also have a good amount of fiber that prevents an abrupt increase in your blood sugar and makes it easy for you to get full .\nIn a study that examines the antidiabetic effect of citrus fruits , there was an increase In the uptake of blood sugar into the muscles and fat cells .\nThis blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linked to their high flavonoid content , including cosmosiin , hesperidin , and naringin .\nAside from lowering blood sugar , the vitamins in citrus fruits will boost your immune system , and prevent diabetes complications .\nNuts like walnuts and almonds have a low carb content with healthy amounts of fiber and dietary fat essential for managing blood sugar .\nSeeds , such as chia seeds and fennel flower seeds , are on a whole new level , with different seeds offering different health benefits for diabetic health .\nWhile fennel flower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower systolic blood pressure in people with diabetes .\nNotably , in chia seeds , most of these effects are linked to their rich fiber , omega-3 fatty acids , magnesium , and antioxidant content .\nThis creamy fruit is packed with vitamins and healthy monounsaturated fats and is highly recommended for people living with diabetes .\nWith low amounts of sugar and carbohydrate and high fiber content , avocados deserve a spot on this list .\nTheir fat and fiber content delays the digestion of carbohydrates and , subsequently , blood sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compound called avocatin found only in avocado , functions in diabetics to reduce insulin resistance responsible for high blood sugar .\nWeight management , which is also essential for people living with diabetes , is one of the benefits of this fruit , making it indispensable in

Liver You Need to Know", "content": "Today , you \u2019 ll discover the top 7 signs and symptoms of fatty liver .\nKeep reading till the end to learn the steps you can take to reverse fatty liver disease .\nFirst , what is fatty liver disease ?\nThe liver is a vital organ with many functions , such as the metabolism of nutrients , production of bile and urea , removal of toxins from the blood , and storage of some vitamins and minerals .\nWhen there is excess fat in the liver , an inflammatory response is triggered .\nThis causes antibodies to attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells can not function like healthy ones .\nSo the liver can not detox and perform its other tasks , causing more fat to accumulate .\nThis condition is called fatty liver disease , or \u201c hepatic steatosis \u201d .\nFatty liver is the most common form of Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease ( NAFLD ) .\nSmall amounts of fat accumulation are harmless , but not when it exceeds 5 to 10 percent of the liver \u2019 s weight .\nAs the liver becomes fattier , it can cause fibrosis and cirrhosis \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liver disease .\nNow that we know why fatty liver is dangerous , let \u2019 s get into the 7 signs and symptoms of this disease .\nThe liver produces several enzymes to metabolize nutrients , drugs , toxic chemicals , and other metabolites ( products of metabolism ) .\nLiver Aspartate Aminotransferase ( AST ) and Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) are the main enzymes that show liver damage .\nStudies showed that 25 to over 50 % of fatty liver disease patients have elevated blood AST and ALT levels .\nAn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific to liver damage , while AST can also be increased because of thyroid and muscle diseases .\nAn increase in these enzymes could be a sign of fatty liver disease .\nIf you have Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease ( NAFLD ) , click the link in the description to discover a 4-week plan to make your liver healthy .\nIf you lack self-motivation for physical and mental activities , experience muscle weakness , or feel sleepy , you may have fatigue because of fatty liver disease .\nIn one study done in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with fatty liver disease .\nThat \u2019 s not surprising , considering the liver \u2019 s central role in energy metabolism .\nThe liver communicates with the skeletal system , intestines , nervous system , and adipose tissue , where fats are stored .\nAs fat builds up in the liver , this communication is disrupted , and the muscles , intestines , and nerves start to not function properly .\nFat accumulation causes inflammation of the liver cells .\nInflammation causes immune cells to attack tissue .\nDamage in tissue can cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel pain or discomfort in the upper right side of your abdomen where the liver is located .\nAnother reason for pain could be bile duct stones that accumulate because of fatty liver disease .\nIn liver damage , especially in the severe stage of fat accumulation , hormones that regulate hunger become disrupted .\nLeptin is a hormone that modulates appetite and reduces food consumption .\nWhen leptin levels are above the normal average , it can cause loss of appetite and lead to weight loss .\nGastrointestinal issues involve the digestive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and intestines .\nIn a study done in 2019 , gastrointestinal symptoms of patients with liver cirrhosis were assessed .\nThe most common were abdominal bloating with nearly 50 % .\nAlso , 13.3 % of patients experienced diarrhea , and 8 % of patients experienced constipation .\nA study done in 2009 showed that gastroesophageal reflux was more prevalent in patients with fatty liver disease .\nAlso , these patients experienced more heartburn and belching .\nGastroesophageal reflux is a condition in which stomach fluid move back up to the esophagus .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another reason is that toxins and waste products can not be eliminated by the liver , and as a result , damage the stomach and esophagus mucosa , resulting in reflux .\nThe liver produces platelet , which is a type of blood cell that helps to clot to stop bleeding .\nPlatelet production is decreased in cirrhosis , the severe stage of fatty liver disease .\nWhen blood can not \u201c clot \u201d , bruising , even bleeding , can occur in injury .\nA person may also experience jaundice , itching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it !\nThe 7 symptoms of fatty liver .\nIf you observe these symptoms , get a blood test , ultrasound , or biopsy to be sure about your liver function .\nHowever , this man-made disease can only be healed through diet and lifestyle changes .\nNow , here are \u201c 8 things \u201d you can do to prevent and reverse fatty liver disease .\nNumber 1 .\n\u201c Regular Exercise.\n\u201d Aerobic exercises such as walking , running , cycling , Zumba , can increase fat-burning and decrease the synthesis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c Limit alcohol consumption.\n\u201d Alcohol increases fat accumulation in the liver .\nWhen alcohol is broken down in the liver , an enzyme converts ethanol to a toxic compound called acetaldehyde , which is carcinogenic or cancer-causing .\nNumber 3 .\n\u201c Consume fiber rich-foods.\n\u201d Fiber can lower your blood lipids \u2013 triglycerides , and LDL , known as \u201c bad cholesterol \u201d .\nTry to add at least 5 portions of fruits and vegetables to your diet .\nYou should also eat other fiber-rich foods such as beans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Number 4 .\n\u201c Cut Out Sugar.\n\u201d Sugar can cause weight gain and spike blood glucose levels , especially in individuals with prediabetes and diabetes .\nHigh blood glucose levels lead to fat accumulation in the liver .\nAvoid refined sugar , commercial fruit juice , and packaged foods and snacks .\nSee our video \u201c Top 13 Foods That Cause Inflammation \u201d .\nNumber 5 .\n\u201c Cut Out High Fructose Corn Syrup ( HFCS ) .\n\u201d HFCS is as bad , or maybe worse than sugar .\nThere are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatty acid conversion in the liver .\nWhen large quantities of fructose reach the liver , excess fructose is directly converted to fat .\nRead nutritional labels and avoid packaged foods that contain HFCS .\nNames that disguise HFCS include glucose-fructose syrup , maize syrup , tapioca syrup , fruit syrup , and crystalline fructose .\nNumber 6 .\n\u201c Maintain a Healthy Weight.\n\u201d Even losing 10 percent of body weight can decrease fat accumulation and help turn around fatty liver disease .\nNumber 7 .\n\u201c Avoid Medication where Possible.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and waste products and in drug metabolism .\nTaking unnecessary medication can exhaust liver cells and worsen the inflammation that occurs with fatty liver disease .\nNumber 8 .\n\u201c Have a balanced diet.\n\u201d Most notably , having a healthy and balanced diet is crucial .\nBecause we convert foods to energy in the liver , any excess of carbohydrates , protein , and fats , are converted to fat in the liver , and some fat accumulates .\nInclude foods that help the liver detox , such as cruciferous vegetables , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thistle , and coffee .\nWatch our video \u201c Top 10 Foods to Reverse Fatty Liver \u201d for a full explanation of liver detox foods .\nNext , Who Is At Risk For Fatty Liver Disease ?\nIf you \u2019 re are obese , older than 50 , have a family history of liver disease , have sleep apnea , diabetes , high blood lipids , or consume alcohol ( over 14 drinks per week ) , you are at higher risk of fatty liver disease .\nDo you have Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ click the

because it subjects the cells to stress because of the prolonged absence of food intake .\nIt \u2019 s a kind of healthy stress , unlike dangerous and damaging chronic stress .\nLimited food means the cells have limited calories and nutrients to use and function correctly .\nWhen that happens , it triggers autophagy , making the cells clean out and recycle damaged proteins and cellular parts so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long do you have to fast before autophagy starts ?\nThere \u2019 s no absolute figure to answer this , but experts say it typically takes 18 to 20 hours of fasting before autophagy starts .\nThe maximal benefits happen after 48 to 72 hours of fasting .\nThat \u2019 s 2 to 3 days , which can help you understand why fasting for a day then resuming normal eating patterns means autophagy may only be short term .\nThe results can vary because people have different metabolic rates .\nFor some people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already prompt autophagy .\nOthers might have to try 24-hour or

disease , high blood pressure , and diabetes .\nToday , we look at how garlic can save your heart , and your life , through its ability to help prevent and treat atherosclerosis .\nFirst , let \u2019 s briefly mention what is atherosclerosis .\nAtherosclerosis is a disease where plaque , which is a build-up of fat , cholesterol , calcium , and other substances , forms inside the arteries .\nOver time , plaque can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can limit the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the organs and the rest of the body .\nSometimes , plaque breaks off and causes a blockage , which can lead to a heart attack or stroke .\nGarlic , in its raw and aged form , possesses 6 major therapeutic properties , that work together to treat and prevent atherosclerosis .\nGarlic can help prevent too much calcium from building up in the arteries .\nWhen this happens , the arteries can become stiff and hard .\nThis is called calcification .\nCalcium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major arteries is known as \u201c coronary artery calcification \u201d .\nA 2004 study from UCLA showed that patients on statin drugs who took aged garlic extract for one year had 3 times reduced progression of coronary artery calcification .\nAnother 2013 study published in the International Journal of Cardiology showed that supplement doses of aged garlic extract , B-12 , folic acid , B6 , and l-arginine over one year , increased the ratio of ( active ) brown fat to ( inactive ) white fat surrounding the heart muscle .\nMore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart means that the risk of calcification was reduced .\nThe authors concluded that garlic may be beneficial for patients who are at high risk of future cardiovascular events .\nStudies done at UCLA found that the garlic and supplement mix mentioned earlier improved oxidative biomarkers , vascular health , and reduced the progress of atherosclerosis .\nA 4-year clinical trial in Germany showed that garlic powder , when taken daily , reduced the volume of \u201c arteriosclerotic plaque \u201d by up to 18 % , and the risk of heart attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another 2016 study published in the Journal of Nutrition , patients with metabolic syndrome were given 2400 mg a day of aged garlic for 354 days .\nMetabolic syndrome is a group of health problems that include high blood pressure , high blood sugar , too much body fat around the waist , and abnormal cholesterol levels .\nPeople with metabolic syndrome are at a much higher risk of heart attack and stroke .\nThis condition often occurs together with atherosclerosis .\nThe clear conclusion of the study was that aged garlic prevented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reliably reduces total cholesterol and Low-density Lipoprotein ( LDL ) , while increasing High-density Lipoprotein ( HDL ) , thus helping to prevent cholesterol from clogging the arteries .\nHigh blood pressure is dangerous because it increases your risk of heart disease and stroke , often showing no symptoms until the damage has already been done .\nWhen you eat a garlic-rich diet , it works to keep your blood pressure in check via several mechanisms .\nFirst , garlic helps increase nitric oxide production in your cells by increasing the activity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nitric oxide is important for healthy blood flow because it helps your blood vessels to dilate or widen .\nIf you don \u2019 t have enough nitric oxide , you are at risk for high blood pressure and heart disease .\nSecond , garlic may have a similar effect as popular blood pressure drugs by blocking the hormone angiotensin .\nThis helps to keep blood vessels from narrowing .\nThird , garlic helps your red blood cells produce hydrogen sulfide .\nThis compound relaxes your blood vessels , which keeps your blood pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that help prevent platelets in the blood from sticking together .\nThis lowers the risk of forming a blood clot and improves blood flow .\nHowever , this antiplatelet property of garlic may be a problem for people taking blood thinners , such as aspirin or other anticoagulants .\nDamage to blood vessel linings can be caused by unstable molecules called \u201c free radicals .\nToo many free radicals can lead to oxidation stress , which leads to inflammation and a higher risk of plaque formation and clogging .\nGarlic is an excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitamin C , and quercetin ) , and sulfur compounds , which fight both oxidation and inflammation , making it easier for the heart to pump blood to the rest of the body .\nYou probably already guessed by now that garlic \u2019 s cardioprotective properties have a lot to do with its sulfur-containing compounds , and you \u2019 re right !\nNow , let \u2019 s look at what makes garlic so effective as a natural remedy .\nGarlic is a member of the lily family and is rich in sulfur compounds-something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chives , all of which are from the same family .\nGarlic contains a molecule called allicin .\nWhen garlic is \u201c disturbed \u201d through chewing , slicing , or crushing , it releases allicin .\nAllicin turns into a variety of fat and water-soluble sulfur-containing compounds .\nThese compounds are so volatile that they give off hydrogen sulfide , which is part of garlic \u2019 s unmistakable smell and taste .\nIt is these sulfur compounds that help to prevent and treat atherosclerosis , and heart disease caused by diabetes .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting infection and cancer , detoxifying heavy metals from the body , and preventing the common cold .\nNext , how much garlic should you take daily ?\nThe benefit of any garlic or aged garlic extract depends on how it \u2019 s processed .\nOne of the best ways to eat garlic is in its fresh , raw form .\nYou can chop it or crush it with your teeth .\nRaw garlic has a strong taste , but you can reduce it by adding some avocado , tomato sauce , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooking with it , letting it sit for 10 minutes after chopping may help to preserve more of its health benefits .\nThis \u201c stinking rose \u201d is a simple and tasty addition to many dishes , and getting 3-6 cloves a day into your diet is an easy goal .\nFor supplementation , most studies on garlic use a dosage range of 600-1,200mg a day , usually divided into multiple doses .\nAged garlic extract is a popular supplement because it doesn \u2019 t have a fresh garlic scent .\nIt may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garlic

the first step to lowering risk .\nThe next step is adding the right foods to your diet .\nHere are 7 foods proven to lower blood pressure .\nLet \u2019 s begin with the # 1 food source of a compound that \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beets help to lower blood pressure levels because they contain high levels of dietary nitrates .\nNitrates are found in beetroot and dark leafy greens like spinach and arugula .\nWhen you eat nitrates , your body turns them into nitric oxide , which causes blood vessels to relax and open up .\nThis lowers blood pressure and helps the body carry more oxygen to different parts of the body that need it .\nOther leafy greens with high levels of nitrates are celery and celery root , watercress , leeks , parsley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard that some people take a drug called \u201c nitroglycerin \u201d to help with chest pain and heart attacks .\nThis medication is a synthetic version of nitrates found in beets .\nIn a study funded by the British Heart Foundation ,

lower risk of developing hypertension than those who ate the least .\nNext , a delicious source of magnesium that promotes a healthy heart rhythm .\nMany studies prove that cocoa products can lower blood pressure .\nDark chocolate is particularly effective and only small amounts are needed .\nIn a JAMA study of 44 people with hypertension or pre-hypertension , those who ate a small square of dark chocolate ( 30 calories ) , saw their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and diastolic pressure drop by 1.9 mm Hg , while there was no change in the group that ate white chocolate .\nResearchers say that flavanols , especially epicatechin , are responsible for the blood pressure-lowering effects of chocolate .\nAnother study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that chocolate also contains procyanidins that increase nitric oxide production and relax blood vessels .\nChocolate can help save lives .\nA study of 470 elderly men published in the Archives of Internal Medicine found that those eating the most chocolate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also slashed the risk of cardiovascular death in half .\nComing up , if a pharmaceutical company created a synthetic substance like this spice , it

inhibitors by blocking the hormone angiotensin .\nAnd garlic helps your red blood cells produce hydrogen sulfide , which relaxes your blood vessels .\nGarlic is as effective as blood pressure medications .\nA study of 210 hypertensive patients showed that garlic tablets significantly reduced blood pressure compared to beta blockers .\nUnlike drugs , garlic is safe and well-tolerated .\nSee

your arteries .\nThat \u2019 s when your kidneys open up , and release extra fluid from your arteries into your urine .\nSo you literally flush away that extra pressure .\nAt least , you should , but if this isn \u2019 t the case , you may have high blood pressure .\nThis is a reading above 140/90 mm HG .\nIn today \u2019 s video , we look at the FIVE worst foods that cause elevated blood pressure or hypertension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stroke , and kidney disease .\nWe begin with the # 1 \u201c heart-healthy oil \u201d that is , in fact , destroying your health .\nProlonged consumption of vegetable oils trigger chemicals that cause inflammation in your body .\nThis can lead to hardening of the arteries or atherosclerosis , high blood pressure , and other chronic diseases .\nVegetable oils such as soybean , cottonseed , corn , safflower , grapeseed , and canola oil , are mostly composed of processed polyunsaturated fats .\nDuring refining , these oils oxidize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and become rancid .\nThey have a lot of inflammatory omega-6 fatty acids , and very few anti-inflammatory omega-3 fats , which is bad for you .\nA 2019 study in OpenHeart showed that omega-6 \u2019 s increase blood pressure through their high amounts of linoleic acid .\nIn another 2011 study , rats who were fed palm and soybean oils experienced a noticeable increase in blood pressure .\nIf you buy processed foods , packaged baked goods , fast food , fried foods , frozen foods , and margarine , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prepare these foods .\nOr worse , it may use partially hydrogenated oil or vegetable shortening , also known as trans fats .\nTrans fatty acids are notorious for their double whammy effect : they increase the levels of \u2018 bad \u2019 cholesterol and lower levels of the \u2018 good \u2019 cholesterol .\nThey also increase inflammatory response and cause leaky gut .\nTo replace vegetable oils , cook with unrefined oils like macadamia oil , extra virgin olive oil , avocado oil , sesame oil , and coconut oil .\nRaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources of healthy polyunsaturated fats .\nA polyunsaturated fat that isn \u2019 t processed is usually not inflammatory .\nNext , this mineral gets most of the blame for high blood pressure .\nDoctors have been preaching about avoiding salt for a long time .\nThis is because it was considered a contributing factor in high blood pressure .\nHow is that ?\nWell , salt can cause the body to store water .\nWhen that happens , blood volume rises , and some people get higher blood pressure .\nSalt comprises sodium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is sodium that can be harmful to your health .\nThe body needs a small amount of sodium to function , but most people in industrialized countries consume too much sodium .\nOne survey of worldwide dietary sodium intake found that only 10 to 15 % of total dietary sodium comes from adding it to food cooked at home .\nThe other 75 to 80 % of sodium ingested by people in North America and Europe comes from processed food .\nThis should come as no surprise !\nHighly processed meals are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also full of high fructose corn syrup , chemical preservatives , starchy fillers , and other undesirable elements that all contribute to poor health .\nSo it \u2019 s tough to say that the sodium in these processed foods is the only thing that causes high blood pressure .\nIn fact , the link between sodium and high blood pressure is uncertain , because many of the scientific studies on the effects of salt on hypertension have been inconclusive .\nA 2011 meta-analysis of seven studies involving over 6,000 people found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt intake reduces the risk for heart attacks , strokes or death .\nSome studies have even found low-salt diets lead to a slight increase in health problems .\nThere is a growing body of research questioning the long-term benefits of a low-salt diet .\nThe only time when sodium can lead to hypertension is when there is an imbalance between the salt and potassium in the diet .\nSodium and potassium balance each other .\nToo much salt depletes potassium , and too much potassium depletes salt .\nSo , the important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diet .\nAnd that \u2019 s pretty easy\u2014just add a lot of fresh veggies and fruits , and you have more potassium !\nSo rather than worrying about the sodium content in foods , eat organic unprocessed foods that include an abundance of veggies and fruit .\nMost veggies and fruits are loaded with potassium , which helps the body get rid of excess sodium and lower blood pressure .\nSo , if you have elevated blood pressure , just eat more potassium-rich whole foods .\nCut way back on the salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from refined sugar and grains .\nAnd , of course , avoid processed foods .\nIf it comes in a can , box , bag , and has multiple ingredients , it is probably not good for you .\nProcessed foods containing excess sodium include cheese singles , frozen meals and pizza , french fries , deli meats , condiments like ketchup and barbeque sauce , and pickles .\nCanned foods like tomatoes , beans and soups not only contain too much sodium , they also contain the chemical , bisphenol A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found to raise blood pressure significantly .\nFoods that contain high levels of potassium include avocado , squash , spinach and other dark green leafy vegetables , sweet potatoes , pomegranates , coconut water and bananas .\nNext , this white crystal is the real culprit behind high blood pressure .\nIt \u2019 s well-established that a diet high in refined carbs and sugar increases the risk of obesity , high blood pressure , type 2 diabetes , stroke , and heart disease .\nRefined carbs are starchy foods like white bread , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cereals , and contain mostly sugars .\nThey are made from processed grains like corn , wheat \u2013 and soy ( a legume ) , which have nutrients removed from them .\nToo many refined carbohydrates increase water in the blood , thus increasing blood pressure .\nA 2014 study published in OpenHeart showed that refined sugar , particularly fructose , may be a bigger threat for blood pressure and heart disease ( than salt ) .\nThe researchers found that people who ate processed foods loaded with high fructose corn syrup ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevated blood pressure .\nFructose or HFCS is a sweetener found in 80 to 90 % of all processed foods , sodas , sweetened beverages , juice drinks , and other packaged foods like biscuits and salad dressings .\nSo how does added sugar cause the onset of hypertension ?\nIt does this through several mechanisms .\nOne .\nFructose increases uric acid , which raises blood pressure by blocking nitric oxide in blood vessels .\nNitric oxide relaxes blood vessels and helps them stay elastic .\nTwo .\nWhen the body produces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a higher-carb diet , it can increase blood pressure because it decreases the amount of water and sodium that the kidneys excrete .\nThree .\nAs insulin levels increase , cells become resistant to insulin .\nThis results in magnesium not being able to be stored in the body .\nSo it leaves the body through urination .\nWhen there is not enough magnesium , blood vessels do not relax fully , which raises blood pressure .\nFour .\nAdvanced glycation end products ( AGEs ) directly result from exposure to sugars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also trigger processes that cause blood vessels to stiffen and narrow .\nThis contributes to atherosclerosis and further increases blood pressure .\nTo substantially reduce blood pressure , eliminate wheat , soy and corn , along with sugars and processed foods .\nGo for complex carbs like peas , beans , whole grain ( try to avoid wheat ) and vegetables .\nAnd use moderate amounts of natural sweeteners like raw honey , maple syrup , stevia and molasses .\nComing up , this beverage can spike your blood pressure and damage your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ association between alcohol intake and blood pressure .\nAccording to a study of 15 controlled scientific studies , reducing alcohol consumption lowered blood pressure in a dose-responsive way .\nThe less alcohol consumed , the better the blood pressure results , and vice versa .\nAnother study showed that when people stopped or severely restricted their alcohol intake , their blood pressure went down .\nBut when they resumed drinking the same amount of alcohol as before , their blood pressure went back up to where it was before the study .\nIf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not plan to quit drinking , limit yourself to one drink a day \u2013 whether it \u2019 s wine , beer , whiskey or a mixed drink .\nNext , if you love charbroiled burgers and grilled meats , do this ONE thing to protect your health .\nNew research suggests that eating meat cooked at high temperatures can cause an inflammatory response in the body , which raises blood pressure .\nIn 2018 , researchers presented a 16-year study about the effects of cooking red meat and fish .\nThe study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high temperatures , such as over an open flame , raises the risk of developing hypertension .\nPeople who grilled their meat and fish were 17 % more likely to develop hypertension than those who broiled or roasted their meat .\nHeterocyclic Aromatic Amines ( HAAs ) are carcinogenic compounds that form when meat protein is exposed to high temperatures .\nThe risk of hypertension increases with the amount of HAAs present .\nWell-done meats have more HAAs than rarer meats .\nIf you are going to grill meats , using rosemary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spices in a marinade can decimate any carcinogens .\nHarvard Medical School researchers have found that inflammation may be an underlying cause of high blood pressure .\nThey found that levels of an inflammatory marker called C-reactive protein are

your leg (prevent Deep Vein Thrombosis)", "content": "Blood clots are shockingly common .\nOn average , one person dies from a blood clot every 6 minutes in the United States .\nMedically known as deep vein thrombosis or DVT , blood clots can form in any part of the body , but usually occur in the pelvis , thigh , or lower leg .\nWhen a part of a clot breaks loose and travels to the lungs where it causes a blockage , it \u2019 s called a pulmonary embolism or PE .\nThis is instantly an emergency room situation that can not be ignored or delayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we look at 10 signs that alert you to a blood clot in the legs .\nWe also reveal one \u201c hidden \u201d condition that causes blood clots , and how you can prevent them .\nSwelling in the legs can be a sign of a blood clot ( or thrombus ) , especially if other home treatments for inflammation , such as cold and hot compresses , can not ease the symptom .\nThe dense tissue and bone in this part of the body makes it difficult to break down or absorb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swelling in your calf , ankle , or upper leg , seek medical attention immediately .\nThere are many reasons a person \u2019 s skin becomes red , such as sun exposure or an allergic reaction .\nIf the redness is accompanied by dark patches , it could be a clot .\nThese clots may get bigger over time for no reason .\nIf you have redness that lingers after an injury or surgery , see a doctor .\nThe skin around a blood clot becomes warm to the touch and may even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the cold compress doesn \u2019 t help , see a doctor .\nWarm skin can also be accompanied by tingling and throbbing sensations .\nThe skin surrounding the clot may become sore , or sensitive to the touch .\nBesides acute pain , this symptom frequently requires individuals to rely on their other leg to relieve the discomfort , which can lead to muscle and joint strain .\nWhen a blood clot in the leg grows larger , the body goes into overdrive to eliminate it .\nVital organs have to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart rate .\nA higher heart rate can produce its own symptoms , such as shortness of breath and chest pains .\nA racing heart that can not be attributed to physical activity or other recognized reasons should be assessed by a physician .\nWhen a blood clot detaches and enters the bloodstream , some people develop a fever .\nThis fever may be accompanied by chills , shivering , sweating , headaches , weakness , dehydration , fatigue , and body aches .\nIn severe cases , the fever may shoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , confusion , and other psychological anomalies .\nSometimes , distended or swollen veins may be a sign of a blood clot .\nClots that become large can compress the surrounding blood vessels .\nPeople with varicose veins have an increased risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the leg .\nFainting is often associated with low blood sugar or dehydration , but it can also be a sign of a blood clot .\nWhen a blood clot blocks the flow of oxygenated blood to the brain , you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood clot moves to the lungs , you may have respiratory symptoms .\nMany people are unaware that a blood clot can cause a person to faint .\nThis can lead to a misdiagnosis .\nWhen a clot grows larger , the body \u2019 s natural defense mechanisms go into overdrive to eliminate it .\nThis can use up a lot of energy and resources , leaving a person feeling tired .\nEven after sleeping , a person may still feel tired and weak .\nIf you have unexplained fatigue , it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially if you have pain , swelling , and redness in the affected area .\nNo symptoms may appear in about half the cases of blood clots in the leg until the clot detaches and becomes lodged in the lungs .\nThere is a limited time period when doctors can treat or remove the clot before it causes deadly consequences such as pulmonary embolism .\nNext , what are the symptoms of pulmonary embolism ?\nThese include low blood oxygen levels , shortness of breath , rapid heart rate , pain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low blood pressure .\nContact a doctor as soon as multiple symptoms appear .\nIf caught early enough , treatments such as anticoagulants and thrombolytics can be administered , which may break up the clot before it causes any serious damage .\nNext , what are the consequences of deep vein thrombosis ?\nThe CDC estimates that 50 % of those who survive a blood clot experience will have long-term consequences for the rest of their lives .\nAnd one third will have another clot within 10 years of the first one .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vein , they cause a condition called post-thrombotic syndrome or PTS .\nSymptoms of PTS include swelling , pain , discoloration , and , in severe cases , scaling or ulcers in the affected part of the body .\nSometimes , these symptoms can be so severe that a person becomes disabled .\nNext , this condition that causes deep vein thrombosis is largely ignored .\nThe condition known as high blood viscosity not only increases your risk of DVT , it also puts you at higher risk for heart disease , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and diabetes .\nHaving high blood viscosity means that your blood is very thick and sticky .\nThis makes it harder for your heart to pump blood and increases the friction on the inside of your veins .\nAs blood flow becomes sluggish , the amount of oxygen and nutrients delivered to your cells and organs is decreased .\nTo learn about your blood viscosity , you can request a complete blood count from your doctor .\nA study from Edinburgh University in the United Kingdom , showed conclusively that raised blood viscosity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure and \u201c bad \u201d cholesterol in predicting death by heart attack .\nIn other words , the quality of your artery walls is not the only thing that matters , the quality of your blood matters too .\nHowever , over the last two decades , mainstream medicine has been obsessed with reducing cholesterol levels through statin drugs , while largely ignoring high blood viscosity and the fatal blood clots it can cause .\nSo what can you do about high blood viscosity ?\nOne simple way to fix this is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Omega-3 fatty acids are natural anti-inflammatories , which means they help reduce inflammation .\nThey also slow blood clotting and thin the blood .\nIt should be mentioned that DVT in the leg , pelvis , and sometimes arm , does NOT cause heart attack or stroke .\nThe blood clot in an artery in the heart or brain , known as arterial thrombosis , is what causes a heart attack and stroke .\nNext , what can you do to prevent blood clots in your legs and improve blood viscosity ?\nDuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move or stretch .\nElevate your legs at least 6 inches above the level of your heart every day .\nKeep your feet flat on the floor while sitting , do not cross your ankles .\nMove around for at least 30 minutes every day .\nConsider graduated compression stockings if you are at risk for blood clots .\nBe careful of impact injuries to your arms and legs .\nIf you \u2019 re a woman taking birth control , ask your doctor about non-hormonal options .\nEliminate excess sodium from your @ @ @ @ @ @ @

.\nChanges to your eyes , such as blurry vision , eye floaters , and bloodshot eyes , can tip you off to a problem with your health .\nIn today \u2019 s video , we \u2019 ll look at the top THREE symptoms of heart disease your eyes reveal , as well as FIVE other health conditions .\nDid you know that the eye is the only place in the body where a doctor can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nerves and connecting tissue , without relying on an invasive procedure ?\nIt turns out the arrangement of blood vessels at the back of the eyes is closely connected to the health of your heart .\nWhen decreased blood flow caused by heart disease , known as Ischemia , leads to inadequate blood flow to the eyes , and causes cells in the retina to die , it leaves behind permanent marks .\nThese marks are the reason eye doctors are often the first to spot health problems , including high blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more .\nSo , it \u2019 s no exaggeration to say that a comprehensive eye exam can save not just your eyesight , but also your life .\nNow , let \u2019 s get on with our Number 8 .\nHigh Blood Pressure .\nAn eye doctor or ophthalmologist can look at the blood vessels in your eyes using an imaging tool and detect signs of high blood pressure .\nHigh blood pressure can cause retinopathy or damage to the eye \u2019 s primary blood supply .\nAnd this can lead to blurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood clots , swelling , damage to the nerves or even a stroke in the retina , resulting in complete loss of vision .\nTo detect high blood pressure , the ophthalmologist will see if there are changes in the ratio or shape of retinal vessels or if there are small blood clots in the eyes .\nIn healthy individuals , the ratio between the size of retinal arteries to veins is supposed to be approximately two to three .\nSo , if the artery is a lot smaller than the vein , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dilated , that may show high blood pressure or cardiovascular risk factors .\nNext we have Number 7 .\nBlocked Arteries .\nHypertension isn \u2019 t the only heart-related condition that can be detected in the eye .\nDuring an eye exam , an ophthalmologist can see if there is any embolus in the eye .\nAn embolus is a blood clot or a piece of plaque that acts like a clot .\nWhen the clot travels from the site where it formed to another location in the body , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurs when an embolus has traveled through the arteries and become stuck in small vessels or organs like the brain or the retina .\nAn arterial embolism may be caused by one or more clots .\nWhen arterial blockages occur in the brain , it \u2019 s called a stroke .\nWhen it happens near the heart , it \u2019 s called a heart attack .\nAnd when it happens in the eyes , it \u2019 s known as retinal arterial occlusion .\nThis condition can lead to the death of nerve cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or worsen vision loss .\nSome individuals may regain their vision one year after experiencing an eye stroke , but their vision may never fully recover .\nPeople who are older or have high blood pressure , glaucoma , or diabetes are at higher risk of developing this eye condition .\nNext on our list , Number 6 is High Cholesterol .\nCholesterol plays an important role in human tissue , but too much of the wrong type can turn into plaque buildup and narrow arterial walls .\nThe \u201c wrong type \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cholesterol , and not normal LDL cholesterol .\nOxidized cholesterol is what causes the damage to artery walls and increases the risk of a heart attack and stroke .\nLDL cholesterol by itself is not bad .\nIt is required to transport fat and cholesterol to the locations throughout our bodies where they are needed .\nAnd guess where oxidized cholesterol comes from ?\nThat \u2019 s right , if you \u2019 ve watched our video on inflammation , you already know that prolonged consumption of oxidized vegetable seed oils and high-fructose-corn-syrup is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to our eyes .\nThrough an OCT scan , your eye doctor can detect signs of high cholesterol by looking at your eyelids , cornea , and retina .\nThere \u2019 s an eye symptom called Xanthelasma , and it \u2019 s commonly linked to high cholesterol .\nXanthelasma occurs as yellow fatty deposits of cholesterol that show up on the eyelids or on the skin around the eyelids or near the nose .\nThis condition is more common in individuals who are overweight , have diabetes or have high blood pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also point to high cholesterol .\nNormally , the cornea is a clear tissue on the front of the eye , but when cholesterol deposits develop , it causes a white or gray ring to develop along the outer edge .\nIt \u2019 s important to note that not every person with arcus senilis has high cholesterol .\nHowever , if high cholesterol runs in your family , you \u2019 re more likely to develop this eye condition .\nNow that we \u2019 ve covered the top 3 cardiovascular symptoms , let \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may reveal about your health .\nNext on our list is Number 5 .\nDiabetes .\nThe tiny blood vessels that supply your retina can be a telltale sign of diabetes .\nWhat happens is , when these blood vessels are damaged from high blood sugar levels , they can leak blood into the retina and distort vision .\nYour ophthalmologist can see this during a dilated eye exam .\nThis condition is known as diabetic retinopathy .\nEarly symptoms of diabetic retinopathy include blurred vision , floaters , loss of central vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vision .\nYou may have experienced floaters before .\nThese are small , dust-like specks that seem to move when your eyes move .\nThey are actually tiny clumps of gel or cells inside the vitreous , the clear jelly-like fluid that fills the inside of your eye .\nThese things appear to be in front of your eyes , but they are , in fact , floating within it .\nNow , if you see floaters in your field of vision , it \u2019 s usually a normal part of aging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens during diabetic retinopathy is that the retina grows new blood vessels through a process called \u201c neovascularization , \u201d and these often bleed into the vitreous .\nIf they only bleed a little , you may see a few dark floaters .\nIf they bleed a lot , it may block all vision .\nIn the worst case , this could lead to the eye developing scar tissue and a detached retina , which can cause blindness .\nIf diabetic retinopathy is a suspected cause for your floaters , you should also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThese include excessive thirst or hunger , frequent urination , fatigue , recurring infections , unexplained weight loss , numbness in the hands or feet , and certain skin symptoms , including darkened patches of skin .\nFortunately , diabetic retinopathy can be reversed naturally .\nTo see our recommended solution to reverse diabetes and complications like neuropathy and retinopathy , click the link below .\nNext , we have Number 4 .\nBrain tumors .\nWhen a brain tumor forms and causes swelling and increased pressure in the brain , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the eye .\nThere may also be pressure on the optic nerve your eye doctor can detect .\nIn addition , some individuals may notice double vision , loss of peripheral vision , or a change to their pupil size , sometimes on just one side .\nLupus is an autoimmune disease , which means your body \u2019 s immune system attacks your own tissues and organs .\nInflammation caused by lupus can affect many body systems \u2014 including your joints , skin , kidneys , blood cells , brain , heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can cause changes in the skin around the eyelids , dry eyes , inflammation of the white outer layer of the eyeball , blood vessel changes in the retina , and damage to nerves controlling eye movement , thus affecting vision .\nIf the eyeballs are bulging or protruding from eyelids that seem to retract , an eye specialist may suspect an overactive thyroid gland or hyperthyroidism , which is often caused by Grave \u2019 s Disease .\nThis condition affects the tissues and muscles around the eye and symptoms may also include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes .\nAnd at Number 1 , we have Rheumatoid Arthritis .\nA routine eye exam can also reveal systemic inflammatory diseases that cause arthritis and inflammation in other parts of the body .\nPatients who experience dry eyes , red eyes and severe pain may exhibit signs of rheumatoid arthritis .\nPain and redness may be symptoms of scleritis , a painful inflammatory condition of the sclera , the white part of your eye .\nThe inflammation can sometimes make the white part of the eye look purple .\nPain from scleritis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can even spread to your face and jaw .\nThere you have it !\nThe top 3 symptoms of heart disease your eyes reveal and 5 other health

neuropathy .\nNerve damage often affects the feet and legs first , before it spreads to the hands and arms .\nThe symptoms of peripheral neuropathy in the feet include tingling , numbness , muscle twitches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or burning pain .\nThe feet become ultra-sensitive to pressure , touch , and temperature .\nSome people report feeling like they \u2019 re wearing socks or shoes when their feet are bare .\nThis is dangerous , because if you have numb feet , it \u2019 s easy to hurt your feet by stepping on something sharp or hot .\nYou may also develop a blister caused by badly-fitting shoes and not be aware .\nAnd if you do not feel any pain , you may continue walking without protecting against your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into an ulcer .\nNow , high blood sugar also damages the walls of blood vessels , and reduces blood flow to your feet .\nThis means that the skin and nerves on your feet receive less oxygen and nutrients , and a lower number of infection-fighting cells .\nAs a result , wounds take longer to heal and can lead to gangrene .\nWith that said , let \u2019 s get into the three steps to reverse diabetic neuropathy .\nOne , controlling blood sugar levels .\nTwo , prevent or relieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common nutrient deficiencies found in people with prediabetes and diabetes .\nLet \u2019 s start with a mineral that controls blood sugar .\nThis little-known , yet clinically effective form of chromium reduces insulin resistance , the number ONE root cause of prediabetes , diabetes and neuropathy .\nChromium picolinate is the fastest and easiest form of chromium your body can absorb .\nA study of 833 people with Type 2 diabetes found that taking a daily dose of 500 mcg of chromium picolinate led to significant reductions in blood glucose levels after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasted for at least one year .\nThe participants also experienced significant long term reduction in diabetic symptoms such as fatigue , frequency of urination and excessive thirst .\nThis powerful mineral may also decrease cravings for sugar-rich food .\nYou won \u2019 t be stressing over sugar cravings anymore , and will probably lose weight and even regain your energy , which is a bonus .\nNext we have Number 8 , Cinnamon .\nThis well-known spice helps improve fasting blood glucose and A1C .\nHowever , you \u2019 ll want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lanka .\nThat \u2019 s because TRUE cinnamon barely contains any coumarin , unlike other types of \u201c fake \u201d cinnamon .\nCoumarin is toxic when consumed in large amounts , and can cause liver damage .\nNext on our list is Number 7 , Vitamin D3 .\nThis is the kind of vitamin D your body makes naturally from the sun .\nVitamin D3 helps improve insulin sensitivity .\nThis hormone is essential for regulating the removal of sugar out of the blood , thus lowering A1C .\nDid you know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief from your nerve pain and numbness ?\nIn one study , 60 people with diabetic neuropathy , who were deficient in vitamin D , were given oral supplements of vitamin D3 ( 50,000 IU ) once weekly for 12 weeks .\nNot only did their serum level of vitamin D increase , but there was a significant decrease in the stabbing , burning , and tingling in their hands and feet .\nAlso , new research shows that vitamin D3 may help your body grow new nerve endings .\nYour nerve endings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and heat .\nComing up next is Number 6 , Alpha-lipoic acid .\nFor this video , I will refer to it as ALA. ALA is an antioxidant that helps protect the body from inflammation and improves nerve conduction velocity .\nIt has been used for decades in Europe to counter nerve damage in people with Type 1 and 2 diabetes .\nBecause of its effect on glucose metabolism , ALA may improve the glucose-lowering action of insulin .\nIn a clinical trial , researchers gave 328 people with tingling , burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , either ALA or a placebo .\nThe results were truly remarkable .\nThe group taking ALA reduced their nerve pain by up to 52 % within three weeks .\nAnd those who received 600 mg of ALA daily were found to have the greatest reduction in pain .\nNow , you would have to eat about 12 bowls of spinach or 8 tomatoes , to get that amount of ALA into your day !\nR-Lipoic acid , a potent form of lipoic acid with 50 % greater biological activity , provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommended solution to get these nutrients to fix your blood sugar and erase neuropathy , click the link below at the end of this video .\nNext up , we have Number 5 .\nVitamin B12 .\nVitamin B12 repairs your protective myelin coating .\nThis helps your nerves communicate correctly with your brain again .\nAs a result , you can finally get relief from neuropathy symptoms .\nThe myelin sheath is an insulating layer that covers the body of nerves or axons .\nIt enables electrical impulses to travel quickly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are two types of vitamin B12 : cyanocobalamin and methylcobalamin .\nThe first one , cyanocobalamin , is hard to digest .\nThat means you don \u2019 t get the full benefit from it .\nThat \u2019 s why we recommend methylcobalamin .\nIt \u2019 s easy for your body to digest and use , so it can repair your damaged nerves right away .\nClinical research from the medical journal , PLOS ONE , shows that B12 deficiencies are more common in diabetics .\nThis is likely because of the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vitamin B12 is found in animal foods and healthy vegan diets are fortified with the vitamin .\nTo get a good list of vitamin B12 foods , see our video , \u201c Top 11 Vitamin B12 Deficiency Symptoms \u201d .\nResearch shows that vitamin B6 or pyridoxine can improve nerve density in your feet .\nThis is important because the more nerves you have in your feet , the easier it is for them to send clear and correct messages to your brain .\nThis can help stop tingling , numbness , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add lean meats , bell peppers , yams , broccoli , sunflower seeds and hazelnuts to your diet .\nNext up , our Number 3 is Benfotiamine .\nBenfotiamine is a fat-soluble form of vitamin B1 in its highest bioavailable form .\nThis vitamin has been shown to significantly decrease symptoms of burning , tingling , prickling or loss of sensation in feet and hands .\nIts use may also reduce serious complications like deafness , loss of vision , high blood pressure and stroke .\nBenfotiamine may also help repair and regenerate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These include nerve cells in the extremities , and small capillaries in the eyes and kidneys , thus restoring some function to these organs .\nBenfotiamine works by purging excess levels of potentially damaging glucose metabolites from within the blood vessel cells .\nIn this way , it helps to balance cellular glucose metabolism .\nThe natural version of benfotiamine , thiamine , can be found in foods like whole grains , meat , legumes , and nuts .\nPeople with diabetes have been found to have low levels of this vitamin .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Acetyl-L-Carnitine .\nFor this video , I will refer to it as ALCAR .\nALCAR is an amino acid used to break down carbs and fat more efficiently for mental and physical energy to power through your day .\nIt can also help you lose weight .\nStudies have shown that supplementing with ALCAR at 1,000 mg per day , helps relieve pain and improve nerve fiber regeneration and vibration perception in patients with diabetic neuropathy .\nAnimal-based foods are excellent sources of carnitine , including beef , chicken , milk and cheese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have Choline .\nCholine is a nutrient found in egg yolks , beef liver , legumes , nuts , beef , and leafy greens .\nIt is an essential component of our cell membranes .\nCholine is a building block for the nerve cells and helps our bodies create the neurotransmitter acetylcholine .\nIt protects the myelin sheath and improves nerve function when combined with vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 .\nNow , choline has been well studied to improve mental health and cognitive function in aging .\nThis is important , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Journal of Diabetes , people with diabetes run a high risk of developing dementia and cognitive impairment .\nThere you have it !\nThe 9 vitamins that reverse diabetes and repair damaged nerves .\nThis group of nutrients can also prevent and stop other diabetes complications , such as eye problems ( retinopathy ) , kidney problems ( nephropathy ) , gum disease , heart attack and stroke , and sexual problems in men and

"title": "12 signs of LOW thyroid levels (Hypothyroidism)", "content": "In today \u2019 s video , we \u2019 ll be talking about a crucial hormone in our body : the thyroid hormone , and what happens when you have hypothyroidism , or low levels of thyroid hormone in your body .\nYour thyroid is the butterfly-shaped gland in your lower throat .\nIt produces two main hormones , T4 and T3 , which are responsible for managing your metabolism , body temperature , and blood pressure .\nWhen your hormone levels are too high or low , it can cause all sorts of chaos .\nThat \u2019 s because every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !\nWhen the thyroid is under-active and does not create enough hormones , it \u2019 s called hypothyroidism .\nAnd when it \u2019 s over-active and releases too many hormones , it \u2019 s called hyperthyroidism .\nNow , hypothyroidism is extremely common .\nIt affects up to 5 % of the population in the United States alone , with a further estimated 5 % being undiagnosed .\nThe primary reason many people are undiagnosed is because many patients , as well as their doctors , mistake the symptoms of low thyroid levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we \u2019 ll look at 12 symptoms of an under-active thyroid .\nKeep in mind that these symptoms are not definitive proof of the disease .\nAlways consult a doctor for professional opinion .\nNow , with that being said , let \u2019 s look at the first symptom .\nNumber 12 is \u201c Hair Thinning \u201d .\nThere are three kinds of hair days : the good , the bad , and the days when your strands are trying to warn you that your thyroid levels are low .\nThe thyroid hormones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hair follicles .\nYou \u2019 ll find that people with low thyroid hormones have hair that is dry , coarse , brittle and slow-growing .\nThe hair loss caused by thyroid problems occurs over time and falls out in clumps or strands .\nAnd it can also happen to your eyebrows , body hair , and eyelashes .\nHair regrowth can occur upon successful treatment of this thyroid disorder , though it can take several months and may still be incomplete .\nYour hair isn \u2019 t the only thing that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Number 11 is \u201c Dry Skin \u201d .\nJust like hair follicles , skin cells also have a rapid turnover .\nThis means they are sensitive to losing growth signals if there is a lack of thyroid hormones .\nWhen the normal cycle of skin renewal is broken , skin may take longer to regrow .\nThe outer layer of skin will take longer to shed , leading to flaky , dry skin .\nAnd when that skin is on the scalp , the effects can show up in your hair .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can lead to an itchy scalp and stubborn dandruff .\nAnother physical sign that can be seen by the naked eye is Number 10 , \u201c Brittle nails \u201d .\nAn underactive thyroid can cause slow-growing and brittle nails .\nIn addition , according to the American Academy of Dermatology Association ( AADA ) , your nails may also develop visible ridges .\nSome patients with hypothyroidism may also notice that their fingernails lift up , splitting from the nail bed .\nThis condition is known as onycholysis and is also referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Onycholysis can appear as a white discoloration , because of the air underneath the nail .\nNext is a subtle sign that is often overlooked .\nNumber 9 is \u201c Chronic Fatigue \u201d .\nWhen was the last time you had a good night \u2019 s sleep and woke up refreshed ?\nNow , imagine having that good night \u2019 s sleep but waking up tired like you have no energy or motivation to do anything .\nThat \u2019 s what fatigue feels like and is one of the most common symptoms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sleep or how many naps you take , the fatigue never really goes away .\nNot only does the lack of energy make it harder to go about your daily life , it can actually worsen the next item on this list .\nNumber 8 is \u201c Weight gain \u201d .\nIf you have a swollen face and put on weight easily , your thyroid may be causing these issues .\nThat \u2019 s because the thyroid helps produce key hormones necessary to regulate body weight , hunger levels , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mild cases of hypothyroidism may increase the risk of weight gain and obesity .\nAs if putting on weight isn \u2019 t already bad enough , the next on this list is a real pain .\nNumber 7 is \u201c Sore muscles and joints .\nHypothyroidism can cause musculoskeletal symptoms ranging from general muscle and joint aches to true muscle disease or arthritis .\nThat \u2019 s because thyroid hormones play a vital role in the reproduction and growth of bone and cartilage .\nNow , the most reported cases of joint pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thyroid involve the knees and hands .\nAnd there seems to be a connection between rheumatoid arthritis and thyroid disorders .\nAccording to researchers , people with rheumatoid arthritis are more likely to develop an underactive thyroid , including hypothyroidism and Hashimoto \u2019 s thyroiditis .\nAnd that link appears to go both ways , meaning that people with thyroid disease have a higher risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis .\nUnfortunately , muscles and joints aren \u2019 t the only areas of the body that can be affected , which brings us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hypothyroidism can affect the heart and circulatory system in several ways .\nInsufficient levels of thyroid hormones can slow your heart rate , make arteries less elastic , and can cause blood pressure to increase .\nIn some individuals with hypothyroidism , the heart rate can be 10 to 20 beats per minute ( bpm ) slower than what is considered medically normal .\nThis condition , also known as bradycardia , can cause weakness , dizziness , breathing problems , and may also result in serious complications , such as heart failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re concerned about heart health , you \u2019 ll want to pay close attention to what \u2019 s coming next .\nNumber 5 is High cholesterol .\nNot many people know this , but thyroid hormones have a direct impact on cholesterol levels .\nIn fact , thyroid hormones play a vital role in breaking down and removing excess LDL cholesterol from the body via the liver .\nWithout adequate thyroid hormones , the liver struggles to carry out this function and LDL cholesterol levels increase .\nHaving high cholesterol levels puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThat \u2019 s because excess LDL cholesterol that isn \u2019 t removed can become oxidized and turn into plaque , which can cause your arteries to narrow and harden .\nResearch suggests that up to 13 percent of individuals with high cholesterol have an underactive thyroid .\nEven people with mildly low thyroid levels , called subclinical hypothyroidism , can have higher than normal LDL cholesterol .\nThe good news is that treating the thyroid problem may help reduce cholesterol levels , even in those who do not take cholesterol-lowering drugs .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hypothyroidism is your brain , which brings us to Number 4 .\nMood and memory changes .\nThyroid hormones are crucial for brain development and influence brain function throughout life .\nIndividuals with an underactive thyroid can experience anxiety , depression , mood swings , impaired memory function , brain fog , and other cognitive related issues .\nThese symptoms can occur because the brain requires thyroid hormones to function correctly .\nResearch shows that low levels of thyroid hormones can cause changes in brain structure and functioning .\nFortunately , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receives proper treatment .\nNext up , a symptom that makes you want to carry a heating pad everywhere you go .\nNumber 3 is Feeling cold .\nNobody enjoys feeling cold all the time , but that \u2019 s exactly what a person with hypothyroidism can experience , even if the weather is warm .\nThat \u2019 s because low thyroid hormones can slow down metabolism , which can lead to a drop in core body temperature .\nIndividuals with hypothyroidism may feel cold all the time or have a low tolerance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more likely to have icy hands or feet .\nComing up next is a frustrating bathroom symptom .\nNumber 2 is Constipation .\nDid you know , there is a movie about constipation ?\nIt just hasn \u2019 t come out yet .\nAll jokes aside , digestion is another body function that can slow down because of hypothyroidism .\nStudies report that an underactive thyroid can cause problems with bowel movement .\nThese digestive changes cause some people to experience constipation .\nAccording to doctors , constipation is medically defined as having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nA person may also experience hard stools , difficulty passing stool , or not being able to empty the rectum fully .\nAnother unexpected symptom of thyroid problems is Number 1 .\nMenstrual changes .\nWomen with hypothyroidism may experience heavy or irregular menstrual periods or spotting between periods .\nAccording to the Society of Menstrual Cycle Research , having low levels of thyroid hormones can cause these problems because it affects other key hormones that play a role in the menstrual cycle .\nHypothyroidism can also cause periods to stop for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called amenorrhea .\nThere you have it !\nThe top 12 symptoms of hypothyroidism .\nIf you have more than one of these symptoms , do consult your physician for further evaluation .\nNext , what are the causes of hypothyroidism ?\nConditions that can cause hypothyroidism include : -Thyroiditis , an inflammation of the thyroid gland .\n-Iodine deficiency , the most common cause of all thyroid disorders worldwide .\n-Postpartum thyroiditis , a temporary condition that occurs in 5-9 % of women after childbirth .\nNext , how is hypothyroidism diagnosed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to diagnose hypothyroidism .\nThis condition is usually associated with an elevated TSH level .\nTSH stands for thyroid stimulating hormone .\nTSH is released by your pituitary gland to regulate the production of T4 and T3 by your thyroid .\nYour doctor may also test for T4 and T3 directly or perform an ultrasound .\nIf you are diagnosed with hypothyroidism , a common treatment is to take levothyroxine tablets every day .\nEnvironmental , diet and lifestyle factors contribute to a malfunctioning thyroid .\nWhile some factors are seemingly out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn the next video , we \u2019 ll look at natural ways to prevent thyroid trouble and restore hormone levels .\nNow , since inflammation is an underlying cause of low thyroid hormones , eating an anti-inflammatory diet can support your thyroid health

\ud83d\udc8a but no one knows this!", "content": "You already know that getting enough vitamin D is important for your overall health .\nBut did you know that consuming more vitamin D is not necessarily better , and in fact , can make things worse ?\nThat \u2019 s because supplementing with vitamin D \u201c without \u201d two other key nutrients can weaken your bones and even contribute to plaque buildup in your arteries .\nSo , what are these two nutrients ?\nAnd how do they help your body use vitamin D properly ?\nThis is exactly what we \u2019 re going to talk about in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is educational and does not constitute medical advice ; we are not doctors .\nSo , the first important nutrient is magnesium .\nEven before you consider taking vitamin D supplements , you should ask yourself if you \u2019 re getting enough magnesium in your diet .\nYou see , magnesium is a cofactor in hundreds of enzymes that are involved in important biological reactions .\nAnd this includes the enzymes that play a role in vitamin D metabolism .\nNow , vitamin D , in either the D2 or D3 form , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converted into its active form , calcitriol .\nFor this conversion to happen , the enzymes present in your liver and kidneys require sufficient amounts of magnesium to draw upon .\nThis means if you have low levels of magnesium , your body won \u2019 t be able to make full use of the vitamin D supplements you \u2019 re taking .\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) , the recommended amount of magnesium is 400-420 mg per day for men , and 310-320 mg a day for women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to oral supplements such as tablets and capsules .\nThere are currently no upper limit recommendations for transdermal magnesium supplements , which are basically those you apply directly to your skin .\nIf you experience poor sleep , lethargy and heart palpitations , this could mean that you aren \u2019 t getting enough magnesium through your diet .\nOne of the best ways to replenish your body \u2019 s supply of magnesium is by eating foods like almonds , pumpkin seeds , mushrooms , cashew nuts , and spinach .\nPlus , getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ways like relieving muscle tension , reducing stress , and helping with your nervous system and your body \u2019 s synthesis of proteins .\nNow that you know how the vitamin D you \u2019 re taking gets metabolized , the second nutrient is something you absolutely can not ignore .\nOne study published in 2010 found that older women who consume very high doses of vitamin D alone were prone to more falls and fractures .\nThis may come as a complete surprise , since vitamin D \u2019 s primary function in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the intestines .\nBut calcium absorption is only part of the equation .\nToo much vitamin D can actually have the opposite effect .\nIn one study , participants who took either 400 IU , 4,000 IU or 10,000 IU of vitamin D over a three-year period showed no improvement in bone density , and actually showed decreased density in the highest dose group .\nWhat most people don \u2019 t know is that vitamin D also facilitates the formation and activation of osteoclasts .\nOsteoclasts are a specialized type of cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them as the first step in a complex loop where bones need to be broken down before they can be rebuilt to allow new bone to develop and to maintain bone strength .\nThe problem is that the calcium you \u2019 re getting isn \u2019 t doing you any good if it \u2019 s not being transported to the right places like your bones and teeth .\nFor this to happen , your body requires vitamin K2 in the form of MK-7 .\nWe highly recommend that you watch our previous video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its different subtypes .\nSo , vitamin K2 is the missing piece of the puzzle .\nThe active form of vitamin D ensures that calcium is absorbed easily .\nThen vitamin K2 activates the protein osteocalcin , which tells your cells to carry all that calcium into your bones and teeth .\nTaking too much vitamin D without vitamin K2 can lead to excessive calcium in the blood , which could end up being deposited into your kidneys , arteries and other soft tissues .\nAdults should ensure they are getting between 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day .\nSo , now you know why you need to get enough magnesium and vitamin k2 along with vitamin D3 .\nVitamin D is incredibly important to your overall health because it can turn disease-causing genes on and off .\nStudies have shown that Vitamin D can switch off cancer-causing genes , and switch on genes vital to immune system function .\nAs you can imagine , this has a positive impact on a variety of bodily systems .\nSo , how much vitamin D is too much ?\nThe generally recommended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day

"title": "Top 10 Uric Acid Foods to Avoid", "content": "Today , we \u2019 re going to look at what happens to your body when your uric acid levels are too high , and how you can reduce it by avoiding certain foods .\nUric acid is a byproduct that forms when chemicals called purines are broken down by your body .\nPurines are building blocks of DNA and RNA and are super important for cell energy production .\nThey are produced by your body and are also absorbed through the foods you eat .\nMost of the uric acid dissolves in the blood , passes through the kidneys and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest is eliminated in the stool .\nHowever , if you eat foods high in purines , and your kidneys are having problems excreting uric acid , you end up with elevated levels of uric acid in the blood or hyperuricemia .\nSo , what are high uric acid levels ?\nFor men , the normal upper limit is 8.6 mg of uric acid per liter of blood , and for women , the value is considered to be 7.1 mg per liter .\nAnything above these levels is hyperuricemic , and symptoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it has been estimated that at least 20 % of the US population has hyperuricemia .\nWhat are the effects of hyperuricemia ?\nWhat happens in hyperuricemia is that crystals of uric acid or urate can form , even if you do not see symptoms .\nThese needle-like crystals can settle in the joints and tissues and cause gout , a form of arthritis that can be very painful .\nThese \u201c needles \u201d literally pierce through the walls of white blood cells , which signals for more cells to come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inflammation and a full-on attack .\nGout attacks come and go and usually occur in the lower legs , like the ball of the foot or \u2018 big toe \u2019 .\nUric acid crystals can also settle in the kidneys and form kidney stones .\nSo , why is elevated uric acid such a big deal ?\nThat \u2019 s because hyperuricemia and gout can cause chronic inflammation over many years , and lead to permanent bone , joint and tissue damage , kidney disease and heart disease if untreated .\nResearch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are linked to high blood pressure and metabolic problems like weight gain , type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease .\nThe good news is that it \u2019 s possible to control and lower your uric acid levels by making simple dietary changes .\nThis starts with reducing or avoiding purine-rich foods that stimulate uric acid production .\nAnd this is exactly what we \u2019 re going to talk about in the rest of the video .\nNot all people with hyperuricemia get gout , but all people with gout have hyperuricemia .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce in your diet if you have hyperuricemia or want to prevent gout attacks .\nRed meat has more purine than white meat .\nLamb has the most purine of all red meats .\nPeople trying to avoid gout flare-ups should not eat beef or pork more than three times per week .\nIf you do eat lamb , go for chops instead of leg meat .\nNext on our list is Number 9 \u201c Fish \u201d .\nFish that are rich in purine include herring , tuna , mackerel , sardines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low-purine alternative that is generally safe .\nPeople with gout should eat fish no more than twice a week .\nComing up next is Number 8 \u201c Wild Game \u201d .\nPeople with hyperuricemia should avoid eating meat from wild game , especially rabbit , venison , quail , pheasant , and goose .\nThese animals have high purine content which can increase the risk of gout attacks .\nInstead , eat white meat like chicken in moderate amounts when paired with plenty of vegetables .\nNext up , we have Number 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are encouraged to enjoy scallops only occasionally .\nBetter options are lobster , shrimp , salmon , and crab .\nA person \u2019 s total seafood intake should be no more than six to eight ounces a day .\nOn to our next item , Number 6 is \u201c Organ Meats \u201d .\nOrgan meats are not recommended for people with high uric acid levels .\nIt is best to avoid eating tongue , liver , brains , kidneys , and sweetbreads to minimize gout attacks .\nComing up next , Number 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably the worst drink when it comes to hyperuricemia and gout .\nThat \u2019 s because it contains alcohol and is also high in purine from brewer \u2019 s yeast .\nAll alcohol-including beer , wine , and hard spirits-cause the kidneys to excrete alcohol instead of uric acid .\nThis dehydrates the body and increases the amount of undissolved uric acid in the blood .\nBeer drinking doesn \u2019 t necessarily lead to gout .\nBut if you have gout and drink beer , you will definitely experience attacks .\nAlso , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contain yeast or yeast extract , as these are high in purines .\nMoving on to Number 4 , we have \u201c High-Fructose Corn Syrup \u201d .\nMany sweetened beverages like fruit juices , sodas , and energy drinks are loaded with high-fructose corn syrup or HFCS , which stimulates uric acid production .\nFreshly-squeezed fruit juices are concentrated with fructose and consumption should be limited .\nIn general , avoid any prepackaged snacks or processed foods like fast food , candy , cookies and sauces that are loaded with HFCS when trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nGetting into our top 3 , Number 3 is \u201c Certain Vegetables \u201d .\nWhile vegetables are recommended for people with high uric acid levels , you may want to limit purine-rich vegetables if you already have hyperuricemia .\nThese include asparagus , mushrooms , peas , spinach , and cauliflower , and legumes like dried fava , garbanzo beans , and lentils .\nStudies have shown that

important role in the body and acts as a glue that helps ensure the cohesion , elasticity , and regeneration of skin , joints , tendons , ligaments , and skeletal muscles .\nAs we age , our body \u2019 s ability to produce collagen decreases with each passing year .\nThis results in having more wrinkles , sagging skin , thinner hair , and weaker joints .\nWhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that your diet plays a much bigger role in the aging process than your genetics .\nThis means that eating the right collagen-boosting foods can make you look a lot younger than your actual age .\nThink of amino acids as raw material that \u2019 s needed by the body to make collagen .\nWhen you ingest proteins , your body breaks them down into amino acids .\nAmong these amino acids , your body uses mainly lysine , glycine and proline for collagen production .\nLean meats , bone broth , fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the best sources of protein you can add to your diet , to make sure you get all the amino acids you need to produce collagen .\nComing up next is Number 6 \u201c Dark Leafy Greens \u201d .\nIf you aren \u2019 t already doing this , adding dark green leafy vegetables to your diet can be a game changer .\nSpinach , swiss chard , and other greens get their color from chlorophyll , which has been well-documented for its antioxidant properties .\nSome studies have even shown that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the skin .\nDark leafy greens are also excellent sources of vitamin C , which is a critical component of collagen synthesis .\nNext , add this category of foods to your diet to boost collagen production .\nTo build collagen , our body produces procollagen , a precursor to collagen .\nProcollagen is made by combining the amino acids glycine and proline , along with vitamin C. It wouldn \u2019 t be an exaggeration to say that without vitamin C , the body is literally unable to produce collagen .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past who were deficient in vitamin C for prolonged periods of time developed scurvy .\nScurvy is a disease associated with collagen degradation and can cause visual blemishes on the skin and bleeding gums .\nAdditionally , vitamin C is also critical for the synthesis of hyaluronic acid .\nHyaluronic acid is a gooey , slippery substance that your body produces naturally .\nIt \u2019 s found throughout your whole body , especially in the eyes , joints , and skin .\nIts primary function is to serve as a cushion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nEating foods rich in vitamin C and amino acids can increase the levels of hyaluronic acid and collagen in the body , which are both important for skin health and joints .\nOn top of that , vitamin C also acts as an antioxidant and helps fight off free radicals caused by environmental pollutants that can damage the collagen present in your skin .\nPopular sources of this nutrient include citrus fruits like oranges , grapefruit , lemons , and tropical fruits like mango , kiwi , pineapple , and guava .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ C that are also naturally high in antioxidants .\nWhile we \u2019 re on the subject of colorful foods , here \u2019 s one you don \u2019 t want to ignore .\nNumber 4 is \u201c Red and Orange whole foods \u201d .\nCarotenoids are a class of more than 750 naturally occurring pigments synthesized by plants , algae , and photosynthetic bacteria .\nThese molecules are the sources of the yellow , orange , and red colors you see in many plants .\nFruits and vegetables provide most of the 40 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAmong the most important carotenoids for humans , beta-carotene and lycopene stand out from the rest when it comes to slowing down the signs of aging .\nBoth lycopene and beta-carotene can help boost your skin \u2019 s defenses against UV radiation and help maintain skin health and appearance .\nMost of you probably already know this , but beta-carotene is a precursor to vitamin A .\nYour body converts beta-carotene to vitamin A according to its needs .\nVitamin A is an essential vitamin at any age , including for cellular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A also plays an important role in stimulating collagen accumulation in your skin .\nIt can also inhibit something called the matrix metalloproteinase , which is an enzyme that chews up collagen as a result of exposure to environmental stressors .\nNext up is a nutrient most of us don \u2019 t get enough .\nEvery single one of your cells is coated with a membrane that contains omega-3 fatty acids .\nYet , the majority of people eating a western diet don \u2019 t get enough of this powerful anti-inflammatory .\nOmega-3 @

seeds , and shellfish .\nIf you don \u2019 t like fish , then supplementing your diet with a high-quality Omega-3 is always a viable option .\nComing up next is something you should probably eat every day .\nGarlic can do more than just add flavor to your stir-fries and pasta dishes .\nIt can also boost your collagen production .\nGarlic is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trace mineral that helps synthesize and prevent the breakdown of collagen .\nGarlic is also high in taurine and lipoic acid , which are essential for rebuilding damaged collagen .\nWhile not everyone may like the smell of garlic , its many health benefits make it a worthy ingredient to add to your regular diet .\nFirst on the list is the perfect snack to boost collagen production .\nNext time you \u2019 re thinking of a snack , reach for a handful of cashews .\nThese satiating nuts are loaded with zinc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been found to boost our body \u2019 s ability to create collagen .\nZinc serves as a co-factor for collagen production , which means that it activates proteins essential for collagen synthesis .\nIt also activates a protein called collagenase that allows your cells to remodel collagen during wound healing .\nZinc is also essential for cell repair and helps protect collagen in the body from damage .\nCopper also plays a role in collagen production .\nIt activates an enzyme called lysyl oxidase that \u2019 s required for collagen maturation .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ copper also helps boost elastin proteins , which can help create firmer and smoother looking skin .\nThere you have it , the top 7 foods to eat to boost collagen production .\nBut eating the right stuff isn \u2019 t the only thing you can do to slow down the signs of aging .\nIf you want life-changing results , you \u2019 ll need to avoid eating too much sugar and refined carbohydrates , which can cause inflammation and damage collagen .\nYou \u2019 ll also want to reduce your exposure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AGEs .\nAGEs are inflammatory compounds that are formed when a protein or fatty-acid combines with sugar in the bloodstream and are linked with chronic diseases like cancer or diabetes .\nThis process is called glycation and is not something you can completely avoid .\nIt \u2019 s a natural part of your metabolism and fortunately , your body has different mechanisms in place , such as antioxidants , to keep AGEs under control .\nHowever , things can get out of hand if you eat a diet high in added sugar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AGEs can also accumulate in the foods you eat , depending on how it \u2019 s prepared .\nFried foods or anything that \u2019 s cooked at high heat are some of the worst offenders .\nOne simple way to lower the amount of AGEs in the foods you cook is to change the method of preparation .\nInstead of always frying or roasting , try boiling and steaming .\nIf you like steaks , you can try making them with the sous-vide method .\nLean towards cooking with low heat as opposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a great way to limit the production of AGEs .\nThere \u2019 s nothing wrong with enjoying a barbecue or french fries , but if your diet is solely based on these things , it \u2019 s not going to bode well for the health of your skin in the long-run .\nOther things you \u2019 ll want to avoid doing is excessive drinking and smoking cigarettes .\nThese speed up the formation of wrinkles , sagging skin and reduce collagen production .\nAs always , this video is educational and does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not doctors .\nIf you enjoyed this video , Like , Share , and Subscribe , and click on the

reduce gout symptoms .\nNot only can hyperuricemia lead to painful gout flares , it can also increase your risk of developing kidney stones .\nAs we mentioned in our last video , the first step to lower high uric acid levels is to reduce purine-rich foods , and avoid alcohol and high-fructose corn syrup .\nMake sure to watch \u201c Top 10 Uric Acid Foods to Avoid \u201d if you missed it .\nCherries are one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reduce uric acid in the body .\nThey help lower uric acid levels by increasing kidney filtration rate and decreasing reabsorption of uric acid .\nCherries are also a natural source of xanthine oxidase inhibitors , which are primarily used in the clinical prevention and treatment of gout associated with hyperuricemia .\nThey are particularly rich in quercetin .\nSeveral studies have found that quercetin supplementation can decrease uric acid levels in men .\nFinally , this fruit is loaded with anthocyanins , which is what gives cherries their deep red color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects in the body , which can help reduce the production of uric acid .\nIn fact , one study found that drinking at least 8 oz of cherry juice daily for at least four weeks , can help lower uric acid levels naturally .\nNext on our list is number 9 , \u201c Vitamin C \u201d .\nAlong with avoiding foods rich in purine , you should also consume foods rich in vitamin C like kiwi , strawberries or bell peppers .\nSeveral metabolic studies and a double-blinded placebo-controlled randomized trial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significantly reduces serum uric acid levels .\nIn a 2005 study published in Arthritis & Rheumatism , participants who took 500 mg vitamin C supplements daily for two months had significantly lower uric acid levels compared to those who took placebos .\nUnless you \u2019 ve had kidney stones in the past , increasing your intake of vitamin C , helps lower your uric acid levels naturally .\nComing up next is Number 8 , \u201c Coffee \u201d .\nOften , coffee drinkers worried about gout are left wondering : Is coffee helpful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contains an antioxidant called chlorogenic acid that can lower your uric acid levels and may even prevent gout .\nFor example , men in a 2007 study who said they drank four to five cups of coffee a day had a 40 % lower relative risk of developing gout when compared with men who didn \u2019 t drink coffee .\nIn

levels .\nBeing overweight or obese makes it harder for your kidneys to eliminate uric acid through your urine .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ times higher for individuals who are obese than those who are at a healthy weight .\nThat \u2019 s because fat cells naturally produce more uric acid than muscle cells .\nA 2017 study with over four thousand participants found that those who lost more than 22 pounds over two years had significantly lower uric acid levels .\nNext up , Number 5 is \u201c Balance Insulin Levels \u201d .\nInsulin is a hormone that allows cells in the muscles , fat and liver to absorb

levels from spiraling out of control , try to avoid consuming too much sugar or highly processed junk food .\nCheck out our video \u201c Top 13 foods to reverse insulin resistance \u201d .\nAt Number 4 we have \u201c Dietary Fiber \u201d .\nEating at least 5 to 10 grams of soluble fiber can help slow down the absorption of sugar .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels from spiking .\nAs mentioned previously , keeping insulin levels low allows your body to eliminate uric acid effectively .\nAdding more dietary fiber to your diet also helps increase satiety .\nThis makes it easier to avoid overeating , which can lead to weight gain .\nThe less excess fat you carry , the less uric acid your body produces .\nNext up , Number 3 is \u201c Reduce Stress \u201d .\nFor some people , stress can trigger gout

of this nutrient .\nAs always , this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice ; we are not doctors .\nSo , how can you tell if you \u2019 re deficient in B12 ?\nSymptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency can manifest in these ways : Vitamin B12 deficiency may cause \u201c pins and needles \u201d in the peripheral nerves of the hands or feet .\nOver time , peripheral nerve damage resulting from vitamin B12 deficiency can cause numbness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard for a person to walk without support .\nPale or yellow skin , called jaundice , may be a symptom of vitamin B12 deficiency .\nJaundice develops when a person \u2019 s body can not produce enough red blood cells , causing megaloblastic anemia .\nMegaloblastic anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency may lead to a person feeling fatigued because there are not enough red blood cells to carry oxygen around their body .\nA fast heart rate may be a symptom of vitamin B12 deficiency .\nThe heart may start to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced number of red blood cells in the body .\nAnemia that results from vitamin B12 deficiency may cause a person to feel short of breath , because of a lack of red blood cells and a fast heartbeat .\nDeficiency in vitamin B12 may cause a swollen , smooth , red tongue , mouth ulcers , or a burning sensation in the mouth .\nThis is due to a reduction in red blood cell production , which results in less oxygen reaching the tongue .\nVitamin B12 deficiency may cause difficulty in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because of less oxygen reaching the brain .\nBeing deficient in vitamin B12 can affect a person \u2019 s mood , and may cause irritability or depression .\nVitamin B12 deficiency may lead to a person both feeling and being sick , and cause diarrhea because of insufficient oxygen .\nAs a

can help you feel more energetic and have a better overall sense of well-being .\nThe average adult should get 2.4 mcg a day .\nNext , what causes vitamin B12 deficiency ?\nThe most common cause of B12 deficiency is inadequate absorption .\nHere is the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B12 binds to the protein in the foods we eat .\nIn order for the body to absorb B12 , it first needs to be separated into its free form .\nTo do this , adequate amounts of stomach acid are required .\nOnce B12 has been separated , it needs to combine with another protein produced by stomach cells called intrinsic factor , so that it can be absorbed once it reaches the small intestine .\nSo , absorbing B12 is a multi-step process , and any disruption can compromise this process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect B12 absorption : As you age , it becomes more difficult for your body to absorb vitamin B12 from foods because you produce less stomach acid .\nAny surgeries that affect the stomach where intrinsic factor is made , or the ileum , which is the last portion of the small intestine where vitamin B12 is absorbed , can also increase your risk of a deficiency .\nLack of intrinsic factor in the body can cause a type of anemia called pernicious anemia .\nThis is an autoimmune disease , which causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroy the stomach cells that produce intrinsic factor or the protein itself .\nVegans who don \u2019 t eat foods high in B12 are also at risk of developing a deficiency .\nPrescription medication can also interfere with the body \u2019 s ability to absorb B12 .\nPeople who take medications that suppress stomach acid for conditions like gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) or peptic ulcer disease , such as proton-pump inhibitors , H2 blockers , or other antacids , may also have difficulty absorbing vitamin B12 from food .\nThat \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the release and even decrease the production of stomach acid .\nMedications used to treat diabetes like metformin can also cause B12 deficiency .\nAlcohol consumption , even on a moderate level , can cause B12 deficiency .\nDrinking alcohol flushes B vitamins from your body and decreases absorption from your gut .\nAlso , you may not be able to process vitamins properly if you suffer from digestive problems , such as Crohn \u2019 s disease or Celiac disease .\nLiver disorders may interfere with the storage of this nutrient because most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is stored in the liver .\nNext , how can you test for vitamin B12 deficiency ?\nFor example , your doctor might recommend a complete blood count ( CBC ) , a homocysteine test , or a methylmalonic acid ( MAA ) test .\nThe most important step , however , is to visit a doctor who has experience in diagnosing and treating B12 deficiencies .\nNext , what foods can you eat to get enough vitamin B12 ?\nUnlike other vitamins , B12 isn \u2019 t readily available to the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced by bacteria in the soil .\nAnd animals and humans must get it from bacteria , directly or indirectly .\nAnimal foods naturally contain high amounts of vitamin B12 because they accumulate this bacterial product during their lives .\nAlso , livestock are often supplemented with B12 in their feed .\nHere is a list of foods that contain significant amounts of B12 : Beef , animal liver and shellfish , fish like sardines and tuna , meat , eggs , milk , and other dairy products .\nAlgae \u2013 such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nori or Laver Buckwheat \u2013 such as noodles or porridge Mushrooms \u2013 Black trumpet and Golden Chanterelle contain higher levels of B12 B12 fortified foods \u2013 such as breakfast cereal , non-dairy milk and nutritional yeast If you have low stomach acid , you may choose to eat fortified foods or B12 supplements , as these forms are absorbed well and do not require stomach acid .\nThe recommended dietary allowance ( RDA ) of vitamin B12 increases as you get older .\nIt \u2019 s recommended that vegans take more than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lack of animal sources in their diet .\nMost of the B12 supplements you find are cyanocobalamin , which is synthetic .\nThe best form of supplemental B12 is methylcobalamin , which is naturally occurring and most readily absorbable .\nSee our recommended methylcobalamin source below .\nKeep in mind that your body may only absorb 50 % of the vitamin B12 it ingests .\nWhat \u2019 s more , certain medical conditions , such as gut inflammation , can impede B12 absorption .\nSo it \u2019 s important to monitor your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin supplementation .\nThere you have it .\nDid you enjoy this video ?\nI

particular that regularly goes unnoticed by doctors and patients alike .\nAs always , this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice ; we are not doctors .\nOver 37 million Americans are living with diabetes , and 1 in 5 of them don \u2019 t know they have it .\nIn fact , most people don \u2019 t find out they have type 2 diabetes until they experience health complications from long-term damage caused by the disease .\nThese health complications include heart disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liver , blindness , and more .\nType 2 diabetes can go undetected for years because the warning signs can be so mild that you don \u2019 t notice them .\nThis is especially true in its earliest stages .\n\u2022 Lack of sharpness of vision or blurry vision \u2022 numbness or tingling in feet and hands And the one symptom that most often gets overlooked is fatigue .\nThere are so many reasons you may feel fatigued , like overworking , stress , not getting enough sleep , depression or other mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wouldn \u2019 t think that it \u2019 s caused by diabetes .\nSo it \u2019 s easy to see why it \u2019 s often ignored .\nBut there is a way to tell whether your fatigue is due to diabetes or if it \u2019 s caused by something else .\nWhile fatigue experienced at any time may indicate a blood sugar imbalance , fatigue after a meal is highly suggestive of diabetes .\nThis symptom is also known as postprandial somnolence .\nIf you always feel tired and sleepy after a meal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get tested for diabetes .\nIf you notice more than one of these symptoms , you \u2019 ll want to get your blood sugar levels tested .\nThe sooner you have a diagnosis , the sooner you can manage your blood sugar .\nNext , how does eating too much sugar cause fatigue ?\nWhen your body detects high amounts of glucose or sugar molecules in the blood after eating a meal , it releases insulin from your pancreas .\nInsulin is a hormone that allows your cells to absorb glucose present in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into energy or store it as fat for later .\nThe rate at which all of this happens depends on how fast your blood sugar levels rise .\nComplex carbohydrates , such as vegetables and whole grains , take longer for your body to break down .\nThis allows glucose to be released into your blood more slowly , causing a gradual rise in blood sugar followed later by a gradual fall .\nBut when you drink fruit juice or eat highly processed foods , the complete opposite happens .\nThese foods are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of glucose to enter your blood all at once .\nThere is a higher spike in blood sugar , which is then followed by an even more drastic fall , sometimes called a sugar crash .\nThe best way to prevent blood sugar spikes is to limit or remove sugary or highly processed foods from your diet .\nIf you \u2019 re just starting out , here \u2019 s a list of foods you should remove or gradually phase out of your diet in order of importance : 1 .\nSoft drinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can of soda contains as much as 8 teaspoons of sugar .\n2 .\nFruit juices .\nFruit juices contain the same amount of sugar as soft drinks .\nChoose whole fruit or canned fruit with no additional sweetening instead .\n3 .\nCandies and sweets .\nTry to limit your consumption of sweets .\n4 .\nBaked goods .\nThese include cookies , cakes , and pies , among other pastries .\nThey tend to be very high in sugar and refined carbohydrates .\n5 .\nLow-fat or diet foods .\nFoods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often very high in sugar to make up for the lack of flavor .\n6 .\nDrink water instead of soda or juices and don \u2019 t add sugar to your coffee or tea .\n7 .\nStop using sugar in your recipes .\nInstead , use herbs and spices for flavoring like cinnamon , nutmeg , almond extract , vanilla , ginger , or even lemon .\nAnd if you haven \u2019 t already started being more active , try to exercise more often .\nYou don \u2019 t have to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting out

prioritize , if you want to prevent cognitive decline .\nAnd the FOUR foods that cause brain inflammation you \u2019 ll want to avoid .\nAs always , this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice ; we are not doctors .\nWhen it comes to keeping your brain young and healthy , B vitamins are absolutely necessary .\nThat \u2019 s because depression , dementia and mental impairment are often associated with a deficiency of B vitamins .\nThere are eight different B vitamins , each with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s start with Vitamin B1 , also known as thiamin .\nB1 is crucial for the basic function of our cells and the metabolism of nutrients for energy .\nWhile the brain represents just 2 % of a person \u2019 s total body weight , it accounts for 20 % of the body \u2019 s energy use .\nThis makes the brain one of the most metabolically active organs in your body , which means it needs the support of thiamin to prevent neurological problems down the line .\nNext , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B2 acts as an assistant to enzymes in our cells that carry out important reactions , such as in the body and brain .\nIt also helps to grow cells , produce energy and break down fats and external materials like medications .\nNext is vitamin B3 , or niacin .\nB3 interacts with over 400 enzymes to produce materials like cholesterol and fatty acids needed within the body .\nIt also helps to convert energy for all our organ systems .\nNiacin is also an antioxidant which helps reduce excess inflammation .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ pantothenic acid .\nThis molecular compound helps our body \u2019 s enzymes build and convert fatty acids for energy .\nB5 also helps our cells generate acyl carrier proteins , helping to produce necessary fats .\nBecause the human brain is nearly 60 percent fat .\nThis makes pantothenic acid one of the most important vitamins in supporting brain health .\nNext is vitamin B6 , or pyridoxine .\nOne study found that high intake of dietary vitamin B6 through food was statistically significantly associated with lower risk of all cancers .\nB6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the body that support immune function and brain health .\nNext is vitamin B7 , commonly known as biotin .\nB7 helps to regulate cell signals for quick and efficient communication throughout the body .\nIn the brain , it plays a vital role in cellular signaling via neurotransmitters .\nNext is vitamin B9 , often referred to as folate .\nB9 is a popular supplement and a key vitamin for supporting brain health , optimal neurotransmitter function , and balanced psychological health .\nAnother benefit is that it helps encourage cellular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have vitamin B12 , or cobalamin .\nB12 is an essential vitamin for forming red blood cells and DNA and supporting the development and function of the nervous system .\nThis B vitamin also supports the breakdown of homocysteine .\nHaving elevated levels of homocysteine increases your risks for dementia , heart disease and stroke .\nUnfortunately , most B vitamins can \u2019 t be stored by your body .\nThis means that you need to consume them in your diet .\nA person who has a poor diet for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitamins deficiency .\nOther things like extended cooking , food processing and excess alcohol consumption can also destroy or reduce the availability of many of these B vitamins .\nThe good news is that B vitamins are among the easiest to work into your diet .\nFoods that are rich in one B vitamin often contain many , if not all , of the other B vitamins .\nHere are six vitamin B-rich foods that you should add to your diet .\nOne egg contains a third of the recommended daily value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounts of many other B vitamins .\nThis dairy product is high in both vitamin B2 and vitamin B12 .\nIt \u2019 s also rich in probiotics , which support both gut and mental health .\nBlack beans , chickpeas , edamame and lentils all help to boost your mood and brain health .\nThey are an excellent source of vitamin B9 , and include small amounts of vitamin B1 , B2 , B3 , B5 , and vitamin B6 .\nSalmon is naturally rich in all the B vitamins , especially vitamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B12 .\nIt \u2019 s also an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids , which has anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective properties .\nThese are one of the best plant sources of vitamin B5 .\nYou can get 20 % of the recommended daily value of this vitamin from just one ounce of seeds !\nSpinach , Swiss chard , cabbage , and dandelion greens are a significant source of folate , a natural form of vitamin B9 .\nIf you want to boost your mood , this should be the first item on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folate is a necessary cofactor in neurotransmitter production .\nLeafy greens also contain vitamin E , carotenoids and flavonoids , which are nutrients that can help protect against dementia and cognitive decline .\nNext , did you know some foods can harm your gut bacteria and trigger metabolic processes that cause brain inflammation ?\nBrain inflammation can lead to depression , anxiety , irritability , anger , memory loss , and fatigue .\nBut the most common symptom of brain inflammation is brain fog , that feeling of slow and fuzzy thinking .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ promote brain health , sharp thinking and good decision-making , there are four foods you should try to cut back on or completely avoid : The first and most obvious is foods that contain added sugars .\nWhile the brain uses glucose to fuel cellular activities , too much can be a problem .\nA diet high in sugar can lead to excess glucose in the brain , which has been linked to memory impairments and less plasticity of the hippocampus \u2014 the part of the brain controlling memory .\nThe second thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foods .\nOne study , including over eighteen thousand people , found that a diet high in fried foods was linked to lower scores in learning and memory .\nThat \u2019 s because these foods cause inflammation , which can damage the vessels that supply the brain with blood .\nAnother study that looked at 715 people found that those who consumed more fried foods were more likely to develop depression in their lifetime .\nThe next item on this list is not a food , but a drink .\nIf you guessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIf a person regularly drinks too much alcohol , it \u2019 s toxic to their nerve cells .\nOver time , drinking too much alcohol can cause brain cells to die and a person \u2019 s brain tissue to shrink .\nThis means there are fewer cells to carry the messages that the brain needs to do different tasks .\nAnd last on this list is processed meats .\nAn analysis was done on over 1,000 people with and without psychiatric disorders .\nThe study showed that nitrates\u2014chemicals used to cure meats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot dogs and other processed meat snacks\u2014may contribute to mania , an abnormal mood state .\nResearch shows there \u2019 s a big difference between the nitrates that are added to foods as preservatives and those that occur naturally in foods like spinach and celery .\nThe naturally occurring nitrates in foods come with vitamin C and other compounds that inhibit conversion into nitrosamines-organic chemicals that can cause cancer .\nIn the brain , nitrosamine exposure has been found to cause neurodegeneration .\nMaybe you can \u2019 t completely give up foods preserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those that also come with vitamin C or a closely related compound like erythorbic acid , which is added to prevent nitrosamine formation .\nNo matter how old you are , it \u2019 s never too late to eat in a way that gives you the best chance of preventing dementia and keeping you focused and sharp every day .\nIf you enjoyed this video , Like , Share , and Subscribe , and click on the

"Cholesterol plays a crucial part in helping cells function properly .\nBut when your cholesterol levels are too high , your risk for heart disease and stroke skyrockets .\nIn today \u2019 s video , we talk about 10 foods that can help lower your cholesterol levels fast .\nAs always , this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice ; we are not doctors .\nDid you know that your liver produces 75 % of the cholesterol that circulates in your body ?\nThe remaining 25 % comes from the foods you eat .\nHigh cholesterol means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or higher .\nThere are two main types of cholesterol : high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) , also referred to as good cholesterol , and low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , also referred to as bad cholesterol .\nWhen LDL cholesterol is exposed to free radicals , it becomes oxidized .\nWhile oxidation is inevitable and results from normal cellular activity , an overproduction of oxidized cholesterol can be harmful to heart health .\nThat \u2019 s because oxidized cholesterol builds up on the artery walls and leads to the hardening and narrowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent this from happening by reducing LDL cholesterol in your body and increasing your intake of antioxidants to fight off free radicals .\nWith that being said , the first item on our list is Number 10 .\n\u201c Legumes.\n\u201d Legumes are a group of plant foods that include beans , peas , and lentils .\nA review of 26 randomized controlled studies showed that participants who ate just half a cup or 100 grams of legumes per day lowered their bad LDL cholesterol by an average of 6.6 mg/dl , compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legumes .\nLegumes are packed with essential minerals and proteins .\nThey \u2019 re also loaded with antioxidants , which are important to fend off free radicals .\nBut most importantly , legumes contain a good amount of soluble fiber .\nIn the small intestine , soluble fiber attaches itself to cholesterol and exits the body as waste .\nThis prevents any cholesterol that \u2019 s been absorbed by the soluble fiber from entering your bloodstream .\nEating more legumes can also help decrease blood sugar levels and increase healthy gut bacteria .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiber .\nNumber 9 is \u201c Oatmeal \u201d .\nWhen we don \u2019 t eat enough dietary fiber , our LDL ends up much higher than it is supposed to be .\nJust eating 3 grams of soluble fiber throughout the day is enough to lower your LDL cholesterol , according to the American Dietetic Association .\nIn a study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition , researchers tested cholesterol-lowering drugs against cholesterol-lowering foods in a group of thirty-four adults with high cholesterol .\nOat products were found to lower cholesterol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAdding oatmeal into your diet is fairly simple .\nBut keep in mind that not everything with \u201c oatmeal \u201d in the name is healthy .\nFor example , some so-called oatmeal cookies might contain very little oatmeal and lots of fat and sugar .\nAlways pay attention to the nutrition label .\nNext , add this food to your oatmeal to make it even more nutritious .\nNumber 8 is \u201c Almonds \u201d .\nAlmonds have been found to have a consistent LDL cholesterol-lowering effect in healthy individuals , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in both controlled and free-living settings .\nIn a study published in the journal Circulation , participants who ate about a handful of almonds a day lowered their bad LDL cholesterol by 4.4 % .\nAnd those who ate two handfuls lowered it by 9.4 % .\nAlmonds also contain relatively high levels of vitamin E. Vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant that can help stop the oxidation process that causes cholesterol to clog the arteries .\nOne ounce ( 28.4 g ) of plain almonds provides 7.27 mg of vitamin E , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s daily requirement .\nThe next time you have a bowl of oatmeal , add some sliced or whole almonds to make your own cholesterol-lowering breakfast .\nNext is another nut that lowers bad cholesterol .\nNumber 7 is \u201c Walnuts \u201d .\nSimilar to almonds , walnuts are loaded with vitamin E. But they \u2019 re also rich in omega-3 fatty acids , the same heart-healthy fat found in oily fish .\nIn one study , researchers found that people who ate about half a cup of walnuts every day for two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an average of 4.3 mg/dL .\nWalnut-eaters also reduced their number of total LDL particles by 4.3 % and small particles by 6.1 % .\nNot many people know this , but LDL particles come in various sizes .\nSmaller , denser LDL particles are often associated with atherosclerosis or plaque that build up in the arteries .\nNuts like almonds and walnuts also contain phytosterols .\nThese plant compounds are structurally similar to cholesterol and help lower cholesterol by blocking its absorption in your intestines .\nComing up next is something you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is \u201c Dark Leafy Greens.\n\u201d Vegetables are good for your heart , and dark leafy greens are particularly beneficial .\nDark leafy greens , such as kale and spinach , contain lutein and other carotenoids , which are linked to a lower risk of heart disease .\nCarotenoids act as antioxidants to protect your body against free radicals .\nThis helps reduce the amount of oxidized LDL cholesterol and can help prevent cholesterol from binding to artery walls .\nThe fiber in dark leafy greens also helps lower cholesterol levels by binding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and making your body excrete more cholesterol .\nNext is a superfood that \u2019 s brimming with antioxidants .\nNumber 5 is \u201c Berries \u201d .\nBlueberries , raspberries , black berries and even strawberries , each contain varying amounts of healthy compounds that have cholesterol-lowering properties like pterostilbene , resveratrol , anthocyanins , polyphenols , vitamins , and phytosterols .\nIn one study , researchers found that drinking a one-liter mixture of freeze-dried and fresh blueberries helped lower oxidized LDL by 28 percent .\nNext is a popular berry that has almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avocados \u201d .\nThey \u2019 re an excellent source of monounsaturated fats and fiber .\nThese two key nutrients help lower \u201c bad \u201d LDL and raise \u201c good \u201d HDL cholesterol One cup , or 150 g , of avocado contains 14.7 g of monounsaturated fats , which can help lower the risk of heart disease and strokes .\nIn one study , overweight and obese adults with high LDL cholesterol who ate one avocado daily lowered their LDL levels more than those who didn \u2019 t eat avocados .\nAnother delicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Number 3 .\n\u201c Dark chocolate \u201d .\nCocoa is the key ingredient in dark chocolate .\nIn one study , healthy adults who drank a cocoa beverage twice a day for a month reduced LDL cholesterol by 6.5 mg/dL .\nTheir blood pressure also decreased and their \u201c good \u201d HDL cholesterol increased .\nThe flavanols found in cacao include catechins and tannins .\nBoth are also found in tea .\nCatechins help prevent the LDL cholesterol in your blood from oxidizing .\nThis is a key cause of heart disease .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ high in added sugar , which is bad for your arteries .\nSo make sure to either use cocoa powder alone or choose dark chocolate with a cocoa content of 75\u201385 % or higher .\nNext is a food staple that is best enjoyed during Fall .\nNumber 2 is \u201c Apples \u201d .\nApples contain a type of soluble fiber called pectin , which has been found to help lower cholesterol .\nPectin can be found in other fruits , like grapes , citrus fruits , and even strawberries .\nThe mechanism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other water-soluble fibers .\nBy increasing gut viscosity , it reduces the re-absorption of bile acids , increasing synthesis of bile acids from cholesterol , and reduces circulating blood cholesterol .\nAn analysis of 67 studies in 2,990 adults found that pectin can help reduce LDL cholesterol without affecting HDL levels .\nOverall , pectin was found to help lower total cholesterol by 5\u201316 % .\nLast but not least , our Number 1 is \u201c Okra \u201d .\nOkra , or lady \u2019 s fingers , is a warm-season vegetable cultivated throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gel in okra called mucilage can help lower cholesterol by binding to it during digestion .\nThere you have it !\nThe 10 foods that lower bad cholesterol and protect your heart and arteries .\nFor every 10 % drop in your total cholesterol level , your heart attack risk drops by 20 % to 30 % .\nIn addition , it

your tissues and cells .\nSee our recommended collagen supplement that actually works Unfortunately , collagen production declines after age 20 .\nBy the time you \u2019 re middle-aged , you could be producing HALF the collagen you did in your twenties .\nEven worse , lifestyle factors like poor diet , smoking , pollution , stress , and excess sun exposure , can deplete your collagen levels even faster .\nOver time , lower levels of collagen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrinkles , weak nails , thinning hair , stiff joints , brittle bones , slow recovery from exercise and digestion problems .\nToday , we look at one important mineral you need to boost collagen production .\nWe also mention two other overlooked minerals your body needs to maximize collagen production .\nAs always , this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice ; we are not doctors .\nThe number one mineral to boost collagen is copper .\nActive lysyl oxidase glues collagen fibers with other supportive fibers , helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tissues .\nBecause of its role in collagen production , copper keeps your bones , heart , and blood vessels healthy .\nCopper is an essential trace mineral that the body needs in very tiny amounts for survival .\nAccording to the Institute of Medicine , adults should consume 900 micrograms of copper daily .\nBesides keeping your skin young , copper is also involved in making red blood cells and maintaining nerve cells and the immune system .\nWhile true copper deficiency is rare , many people are not getting enough of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , up to 25 % of people in America and Canada may not be meeting the recommended copper intake .\nIf you are deficient in copper , there are several things that can happen to your body .\nNumber one , a severe deficiency in copper can lead to a condition called swayback or lordosis .\nThe spine normally curves at the neck , the torso , and the lower back area .\nThis positions the head over the pelvis naturally and allows the curves to work as shock absorbers , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the spine curves too far inward at the lower back , it can cause pain and mobility issues .\nInadequate intake of copper can also lead to fatigue and weakness .\nThat \u2019 s because copper is essential for absorbing iron from the gut .\nWhen copper levels are low , the body ends up absorbing less iron .\nThis can cause iron deficiency anemia , a condition in which the body can not carry enough oxygen to its tissues .\nHaving lower levels of oxygen can make you weaker and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , not getting enough copper in your diet can lead to loose and sagging skin .\nThat \u2019 s because copper can help boost the production of elastin .\nThis stretchy protein that acts like a rubber band does more than just keep your skin tight .\nIt \u2019 s a major component of tissues in your body that require stretchiness , like your lungs , bladder , large blood vessels and some ligaments .\nBecause collagen is needed to strengthen vein walls , a lack of this protein can lead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veins .\nWeakened , less elastic vein walls allow blood to pool within the vein , eventually stretching it to the point where it enlarges and forms a visible varicose vein .\nNot getting enough copper can also affect melanin formation and cause premature grey hair .\nSo what are the common causes of a copper deficiency ?\nSince copper is primarily absorbed in the stomach and then in the small intestine , problems with either organ can affect a person \u2019 s ability to absorb copper .\nHaving digestive issues like low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprue , Crohn \u2019 s disease , and surgery can cause decreased absorption of copper .\nRegular consumption of antacids , which lowers stomach acid , can also put a person at risk for copper deficiency .\nPeople who take high doses of zinc from supplements can also develop a copper deficiency .\nThis is because zinc and copper compete for absorption in the stomach , with zinc being the usual winner .\nThe same thing can happen if you use excessive amounts of zinc-containing denture creams .\nSo , what can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diet ?\nThe very first thing you can do is to eat more nuts , seeds , mushrooms , whole grains and legumes .\nOther foods that are naturally high in copper include organ meat , especially liver , oysters , lobsters , and crabs .\nTo boost collagen production , your body relies on several nutrients from your diet .\nThis includes two other minerals that are often overlooked : manganese and silica .\nCollagen protein contains proline , an amino acid that helps give collagen fibers their shape , and manganese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells use to make proline .\nThe recommended daily intake of manganese is 1.8 milligrams for women and 2.3 milligrams for men .\nBrown rice , pecans , black pepper , and green tea can all help you reach your intake goal .\nThis is a naturally occurring mineral that helps with the production of collagen and has anti-inflammatory properties .\nThis mineral is important for optimal synthesis of collagen and for activating the hydroxylation enzymes , which improve skin strength and elasticity .\nSilica can be found in foods like green beans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rice , cereal , lentils , and beer .\nAll are significant sources of this mineral .\nThe FDA recommends that you shouldn \u2019 t consume more than 10-30 grams ( or 2 % of your daily food intake ) of silica daily .\nIf you enjoyed this video , Like , Share , and Subscribe , and click on the bell icon , so you never miss a video !\nAnd now , over to you

treatment is drawing a protein of the cancer causing KRAS gene to the cancer cell \u2019 s surface , so that the body \u2019 s immune system can target and kill them .\nImagine a future where cancer is gone , never to come back again .\nThis may sound too good to be true , but scientists are one step closer after developing an innovative treatment that could revolutionize how we fight this

"source": "dailyhealthpost", "title": "The #1 Food for Toxic Kidneys", "content": "Did you know that there \u2019 s one type of food that \u2019 s particularly good for toxic kidneys ?\nThe big problem when you \u2019 re diagnosed with kidney disease , especially if it \u2019 s end stage kidney disease , is that there aren \u2019 t many good solutions that give you a good prognosis .\nFor example , they might say you have to get kidney dialysis , and that \u2019 s just terrible to go through .\nBut the thing with kidneys is that it \u2019 s a filter , so any drugs that you \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kidneys in the process .\nSo when we \u2019 re dealing with a damaged filter , it \u2019 s best to use something natural that has virtually no side effects .\nWhy you can \u2019 t live without any kidneys\u2026 The kidneys filter out chemicals , pesticides , insecticides , herbicides , fungicides , heavy metals , plastics , excess minerals and recycles a lot of things too !\nIt \u2019 s also very efficient and gets rid of excess sugar .\nBut eating a lot of sugar can damage these tiny filters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why diabetes is considered the number one cause of kidney disease .\nKidneys also help get rid of excess protein byproducts .\nOne of the byproducts that \u2019 s produced from digesting protein is ammonia , which is very toxic to several parts of the body , especially the neurons in your brain .\nThis is why if someone has too much ammonia in their blood , they can end up with dementia and neurodegenerative diseases .\nIn the body , the liver works closely with your kidneys to remove ammonia safely through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal circumstances , the liver breaks down ammonia into urea , and the kidneys remove urea from the blood through tiny filtering units called nephrons .\nBecause our body is constantly exposed to environmental pollutants , it \u2019 s important to keep both your kidneys and liver healthy .\nThe kidney is the main organ that helps activate vitamin D , and the liver is involved too , but the kidney is even more important in the conversion of the inactive form to the active form of vitamin D , which is vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the symptoms of toxic kidneys ?\nWell , you can have gout , which is uric acid building up usually in the joint of your big toe .\nThis mainly occurs because the kidney is not able to get rid of this uric acid effectively .\nYou can also have kidney stones , where you have this super concentrated calcium oxalate stone that develops in the kidney .\nYou can prevent stones by consuming enough liquids .\nPuffy eyes are another sign that you might have kidney problems , especially if they \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You might also experience edema in your lower ankles .\nIf you press on your lower ankles and it leaves an indentation , then your kidneys may not be working properly .\nYou might also have itchy skin .\nIf your urine looks dark and foamy , that usually means that the kidneys are not filtering correctly .\nJust like if you were to change the oil filter in your car , if you haven \u2019 t changed it for a couple years , it \u2019 s going to be really really dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNow , the foamy part is usually caused by the presence of too much protein in the urine because it \u2019 s not being recycled properly .\nYou may even experience high blood pressure .\nOkay , so now the question is : what is the best food out of all the foods that can support toxic kidneys ?\nAfter going over what kidneys are supposed to do and what occurs when you have toxicity in your kidneys , the answer comes down to bok choy .\nNow why would bok choy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first of all , it is a cruciferous vegetable .\nAnd that means that it has enzymes to help with something called phase two detoxification .\nSince we \u2019 re trying to detoxify the body , consuming more cruciferous vegetables is going to help you in that process because they help convert harmful toxins into harmless substances .\nThis helps reduce the workload on your kidneys .\nNumber two , bok choy is high in potassium , which helps balance out the electrolytes in your body .\nBok choy is also high in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almonds , spinach , legumes , grains and other foods , bok choy is that has very little to no oxalates .\nEating too many foods with high oxalate content can lead to kidney stones .\nBok choy is also low in protein so if you have protein in your urine , you don \u2019 t want to be consuming a lot of it because it \u2019 s going through you .\nYou can just steam it , put some garlic on it , maybe a little sea salt , and it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , number Two ACV .\nConsume apple cider vinegar with some water throughout the day .\nWhat is that going to do ?\nThe acetic acid in apple cider vinegar is kidney protective \u2013 it \u2019 ll help you \u2013 and it will also help your blood sugars , which again is the big cause of kidney problems in the first place .\nAnd of course , I didn \u2019 t mention this but you would definitely want to get on the ketogenic diet and do fasting for sure .\nNumber Three , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juice has citric acid and that can reduce the risk of getting stones .\nAlso , lemon juice even though it \u2019 s an acid turns into an alkaline solution in your body and that can help with gout too because any time when you have these uric acid crystals that are depositing into the joint , if you alkalize the body a little bit it \u2019 ll stop that process .\nNumber Four , Celery juice or just celery by itself .\nOkay , it decreases ammonia and urea .\nIt helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the risk of stones .\nNumber Five , Lower Protein .\nLower the amount of protein like I just mentioned to about three ounces of protein per meal especially if your protein is high in your urine .\nAll right , number Six , Increase Potassium .\nMake sure your diet is high in potassium .\nYou need big salads \u2013 small to moderate protein \u2013 huge salads no grains or sugars or anything like that but a high potassium diet would be protective to the kidney like I said before .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you need certain amounts of sodium and chloride but you really need the ratios correct so we usually need to increase the potassium and not really touch the sodium .\nNumber Seven , Distilled Water .\nDistilled water is water without the minerals and other chemicals .\nWhen you consume distilled water , it can help detoxify a lot of poisons in your body .\nYou can take the minerals that you really need without the minerals that you don \u2019 t want , like excessive amounts of things like calcium and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t want too much calcium and other minerals , which is why distilled water is good for kidney stones and gout .\nNumber eight , Probiotics .\nYour gut contributes to making ammonia , so if you eat foods with probiotics , or take a probiotic supplement , it could help take some of the load off your kidneys .\nThe same goes for the liver \u2013 you could take something like milk thistle to help take some stress off your kidneys .\nLastly zinc has been known to decrease ammonia and urea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have enough zinc in your diet .", "author": "DailyHealthPost Editorial", "url": "https://dailyhealthpost.com/food-for-toxic-kidneys/", "published": "Sun, 25 Sep 2022 19:02:46 +0000", "published_utc": 1664146966,

doctors .\nAre you finding it hard to read a book or look at your phone because it strains your eyes ?\nDo you have trouble making out street signs ?\nAre you worried about driving at night because your vision is blurry and car lights bother you ?\nBeginning in their 40s , many people start to have problems seeing clearly .\nWhy does this happen ?\nThis is because of long-term exposure to a damaging kind of oxygen called \u201c Reactive Oxygen Species \u201d or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As you age , ROS assaults your eyes more and more , making your lens cells stiff and inflexible .\nThis results in blurry vision and eye diseases like cataracts , dry eyes , glaucoma , and age-related macular degeneration .\nSo where do these ROS toxins come from ?\nPlastic containers , processed food , and chemicals in our water , but most damaging of all , they come from blue UV light emitted from your smart phone , computer screen , LED light bulbs , and even sunlight .\nIn short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape the ROS triggered by blue UV light .\nLuckily , it \u2019 s possible to shield your eyes from oxidative damage and keep your eyesight strong and clear by eating the right nutrients .\nThe first two power nutrients are lutein and zeaxanthin .\nLutein and zeaxanthin are yellow carotenoid antioxidants known as macular pigments .\nThey are usually found together in foods like spinach , swiss chard , kale , parsley , pistachios , and green peas .\nThe body stores lutein , and zeaxanthin in your retina , a layer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your eyeball .\nThese antioxidants help protect your eyes against harmful blue light .\nStudies have found that consuming 6 mg of lutein , and/or zeaxanthin per day , replenishes levels in the retina , and can significantly reduce the risk of age-related macular degeneration .\nNext is number three .\n\u201c Lycopene \u201d .\nLycopene is the nutrient that makes tomatoes and watermelons red .\nIt protects your eyes from oxidative stress that causes eye diseases .\nStudies have found that lycopene can help prevent cataracts and reduce your risk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blindness in older adults .\nNext on our list is number four .\n\u201c Omega-3 Fatty Acids \u201d .\nThe long-chain omega-3 fatty acids , EPA and DHA , are important for eye health .\nDHA is found in high amounts in the photoreceptor cells in your retina , where it helps maintain eye function .\nOne study in people with dry eyes revealed that taking EPA and DHA supplements daily for three months significantly reduced dry eye symptoms dry eye symptoms by increasing the production of tear fluid .\nAnother study in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that taking at least 500 mg of omega-3s daily helped reduce the risk of diabetic retinopathy .\nThe best dietary source of EPA and DHA is oily fish like wild salmon .\nNext is a powerful antioxidant .\nNumber five is \u201c Vitamin C \u201d .\nThe concentration of vitamin C is higher in the aqueous humor of the eye than in any other body fluid .\nThe aqueous humor is the clear liquid inside the front part of your eye .\nIt nourishes your eye and keeps it inflated .\nVitamin C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which provides structure to your eye , particularly in the cornea and sclera .\nHow much vitamin C you have in the aqueous humor is directly proportional to how much you eat .\nThis means that if you take supplements or eat foods rich in vitamin C , you can

of vitamin C can be found in foods like bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and broccoli .\nAnother powerful antioxidant is number six .\n\u201c Vitamin E \u201d .\nVitamin E is a group of antioxidants that protect fatty acids from being damaged .\nIt is important for your eye health , because you have a lot of omega-3 fatty acids in your retina .\nNot having enough vitamin E can cause retinal degeneration and blindness .\nEating more than 7 mg of vitamin E each day can reduce your risk for age-related cataracts by 6 % .\nSome excellent sources of vitamin E include almonds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next is number seven .\n\u201c Zinc \u201d .\nThis may surprise you , but the retina in your eyes contains high levels of zinc .\nThis mineral is important for your night vision because it helps to form visual pigments in your retina .\nZinc is a mineral that helps your body metabolize vitamin A , which is another nutrient that supports good eyesight .\nIn one study , older adults with early macular degeneration were given zinc supplements .\nTheir macular deterioration slowed , and they maintained their visual sharpness better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some natural dietary sources of zinc include oysters , meat , pumpkin seeds , and peanuts .\nNext is number eight .\n\u201c Beta-carotene \u201d .\nBeta-carotene is an orange pigment found in many fruits and vegetables .\nYour body converts beta-carotene into vitamin A , which has antioxidant properties .\nThese properties help protect your cornea health and prevent dry eyes .\nCombining beta-carotene with other nutrients like vitamin C , vitamin E , and zinc can help slow the progress of macular degeneration .\nNext is number nine .\n\u201c Astaxanthin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrimp , and it \u2019 s what gives them their pink color .\nThis antioxidant is ten times stronger than beta-carotene and up to 500 times stronger than vitamin E. The unique structure of astaxanthin allows it to pass the blood-brain-barrier .\nThis means it can directly deliver antioxidant activity benefits to the brain , eyes , and nervous system to protect

already know , sugar is one of the worst forms of carbs you can consume if you \u2019 re trying to maintain a healthy weight or prevent type 2 diabetes and other chronic diseases .\nBut not all the carbs are bad for you .\nIn fact , there are some types of carbs that your body needs even if you have diabetes or insulin resistance .\nComplications arise when the majority of your carbs come in processed form like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and donuts .\nWhen you ingest these foods , your body converts all those refined carbs into glucose ( blood sugar molecule ) so that it can be absorbed in the gut .\nThe problem is that refined carbs are converted into glucose at an incredibly fast pace .\nIt \u2019 s so fast , that your pancreas may not be able to keep up with the demand for insulin .\nWhen that happens , blood sugar levels may remain elevated for longer periods of time .\nAnd that \u2019 s not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that supply blood to vital organs , which can increase the risk of heart disease and stroke , kidney disease , vision problems , and nerve problems .\nToo much leftover glucose , not enough insulin\u2026 As we age , the pancreas produces less insulin .\nThat \u2019 s because the pancreas undergoes various pathological changes with aging such as increased fatty tissue , fibrosis , atrophy , and decreased perfusion .\nAnd people with diabetes have it worse because by the time you get diagnosed with the disease , your pancreas has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its insulin production capacity .\nThe worst part is that diabetics are also more likely to have more insulin resistance than anyone else , which makes absorbing glucose by your cells even harder .\nSo how do you go about picking which foods to eat ?\nEating foods that rank high on the glycemic index such as bread , potato , rice , and pasta will inevitably result in significant rise in your blood sugar levels .\nOn the other hand , food sources that rank on the lower side of the glycemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which means these foods won \u2019 t spike your blood sugar levels .\nThe slower the release , the better .\nThis might not seem like much but it gives your pancreas enough time to produce more insulin , which helps keep your blood sugar levels stable .\nIn short , high glycemic index carbs should be avoided at all costs .\nThe lower the glycemic index the less impact a particular food has on your blood sugar levels .\nIdeally , you \u2019 ll want to stick to foods with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anything under 40 is even better .\nA score of 70 is considered high and should be avoided .\nNow , trying to remember the glycemic index chart by heart isn \u2019 t practical .\nYou can download a chart or look it up on your mobile phone whenever you need but there \u2019 s an even simpler way to go about it .\nThe trick is to look at the nutrition labels .\nThe amount of protein and fiber combined together should be greater than the amount of carbohydrates and sugars .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of foods ?\nDid you know that certain ingredients can help lower the glycemic index ?\nAdding something as simple as olive oil to pasta can help lower its glycemic index .\nOlive oil and other healthy fat sources help slow down the absorption of other foods when eaten together .\nYou can also achieve similar results by taking apple cider vinegar during or after your meals .\nLow-fat meals are more than likely to raise your blood sugar levels quickly .\nIf you start your mornings with a cup of orange juice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cereal with low-fat milk , you can expect your blood sugar levels to spike .\nIf you were to replace the same amount of carbs that comes in these breakfast meals with something like an apple and peanut butter , you \u2019 ll see a big difference when you check your blood sugar one hour after eating .\nYou can further improve the glycemic index of foods you eat by making sure you get a decent amount of dietary fiber along with healthy fats .\nThere are two main types of fiber .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThey \u2019 re both beneficial in their own ways , for example , soluble fiber dissolves in water and forms a gel-like substance that helps protect the lining in your gut , lower cholesterol , and

that help relax the veins and arteries to lower blood pressure .\nHowever , they also come with a plethora of side effects .\nFortunately , you don \u2019 t need to rely on drugs to manage your blood pressure and we \u2019 ll show you how .\nAccording to one study , essential hypertension accounts for 95 % of all cases of hypertension .\nEssential ( primary ) hypertension occurs when you have abnormally high blood pressure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical condition .\nThis form of high blood pressure is often due to obesity , family history and an unhealthy diet , which can cause a deficiency in key nutrients needed to maintain healthy blood pressure .\nThis means that there \u2019 s a good chance that your high blood pressure is due to poor lifestyle habits .\nIn fact , the most common causes for increased blood pressure include obesity , insulin resistance , high alcohol intake , high salt intake ( in salt-sensitive patients ) , living a sedentary lifestyle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low calcium intake .\nThat \u2019 s because having either a potassium deficiency , low levels of vitamin D , high insulin , or a combination of the three can lead to stiffened arteries , which ultimately leads to high blood pressure .\nSo , if you don \u2019 t want to rely on prescription drugs in the long-run to manage your blood pressure because of all the unwanted side effects , making changes to your diet is your best alternative .\nThere is one particular smoothie you can make at home to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combines well-documented ingredients that naturally contain antihypertensive compounds .\nThe recipe takes only 5 minutes to make and calls for seven ingredients , none of which are particularly hard to get .\nFlaxseed is a grain that contains high levels of alpha-linolenic acid ( ALA ) .\nALA is a precursor to EPA and DHA , which are essential omega-3 fatty acids your body requires .\nWhen ingested in adequate amounts , it can help restore artery function .\nIn one study , 110 patients with high blood pressure and peripheral artery disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their diet each day for six months .\nResults were compared to a similar group of people who added a placebo to their diets .\nCan you guess what happened ?\nThat \u2019 s right , the group with the flaxseed in their diet showed a measurable decrease in blood pressure .\nSo go ahead and add flaxseed into your blender .\nCelery contains a phytochemical called phthalides .\nAs an extract , it \u2019 s called NBP , and it helps relax the tissue of your artery walls to increase blood flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celery stalk contains very little to no salt and is high in fiber , magnesium and potassium , which can all help regulate your blood pressure .\nAvocados can do wonders for your soaring blood pressure levels .\nAvocados are packed with oleic acid , which can reduce high blood pressure and cholesterol levels .\nAvocados are also rich in potassium and folate , both of which are good for the heart .\nPotassium in particular helps keep your arteries supple and elastic .\nCitrus fruits , including grapefruit , oranges , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They \u2019 re loaded with vitamins , minerals , and plant compounds that help keep your heart healthy by reducing high blood pressure .\nDaily blueberry consumption can help reduce blood pressure and arterial stiffness , which is due , in part , to increased

a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as stroke , kidney disorders , and peripheral arterial disease .\nWhile your heart isn \u2019 t visible to the naked eye , there are still physical changes that can clue you in that something is amiss even before anything happens .\nKnowing these warning signs can make a big difference .\nIf you notice several of these on your body , don \u2019 t ignore them .\nThis is a wake-up call that you need to start taking better care of your heart .\nOtherwise , you risk suffering a life-changing or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Number 1 .\nThe Mark of a Heart Attack on Your Ear ?\nDo you have diagonal creases on your earlobes ?\nThough we are not born with it , this physical trait starts to appear later in life and becomes more and more prominent with age .\nIt \u2019 s known as Frank \u2019 s sign , named after Sanders T. Frank , an American doctor who first described the sign .\nIn a letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1973 , he described 20 of his patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under 60 years old , with angina ( chest pain ) and proven coronary artery blockages .\nSince then , over 40 studies have found an association between this physical appearance of the ear and an increased risk of atherosclerosis , which is a heart condition where plaque builds up inside your arteries .\nThe largest study to date , and probably the most powerful was published in 2014 .\nAlmost 11,000 Danish participants were followed for up to 35 years .\nAll participants were free of known coronary artery disease at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that participants who developed a visible earlobe crease were significantly associated with an increased risk of developing heart disease .\nAnd these associations were found to be independent of other , well-established cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking , diabetes , obesity and hypertension .\nBut why would having an earlobe crease be associated with heart disease ?\nWhile researchers are still not clear as to what the exact cause of the association is , some have suggested it may be due to poor blood circulation often seen in patients with heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seeing This Bump On Your Body ?\nAnother physical sign that your heart isn \u2019 t getting as much blood as it should be , is yellow , fatty bumps .\nThese are called xanthomas and can appear on the elbows , knees , buttocks or eyelids .\nThe bumps themselves are harmless , but they can be a sign of heart problems .\nXanthomas are most commonly seen in people with a genetic condition called familial hypercholesterolemia .\nPeople with this condition have exceptionally high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cholesterol .\nWhen excessive amounts of LDL cholesterol are present in the body they can accumulate in the skin .\nUnfortunately , these fatty deposits also find their way into the arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the heart .\nNumber 3 .\nDo Your Fingertips Look Like This ?\nA phenomenon known as nail clubbing may also be a sign that something wrong is going on with your heart .\nThe tips of the fingers enlarge and the nails become extremely curved from front to back .\nThe reason this visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not reaching the fingers properly .\nWhen your tissue can \u2019 t get enough oxygen , the cells start to produce vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) in an attempt to grow more blood vessels to rectify the problem .\nThe end result is nail clubbing , where the fingernails change shape , becoming thicker and wider , due to more tissue being produced .\nSurprisingly , this physical change is usually painless and happens on both hands .\nNumber 4 .\nWhat \u2019 s That Around Your Iris ?\nFat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up under your skin .\nSome of it may also be found in the eye , as a grey or white ring circling the iris , the coloured part of your eye .\nThis condition is called arcus senilis and naturally develops as people age .\nIt occurs because blood vessels in the eye tend to widen with age , allowing more cholesterol to pass through .\nAbout 45 % of people over the age of 40 have this fatty halo around their iris , rising to about 70 % of people over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senilis does not cause vision problems but its presence has been associated with some of the risk factors for coronary heart disease .\nIf you \u2019 re under the age of 40 and have arcus senilis , have your

cardiovascular health .\nMany studies have found that tooth loss and gum disease like periodontitis are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s because your mouth is full of bacteria , both good and bad .\nIn a situation where someone has poor dental health , it increases the risk of bad bacteria entering the bloodstream from the mouth and causing inflammation in the blood vessels .\nThis kind of damage can negatively impact your heart valves .\nThis is especially true for those that have artificial heart valves .\nAlways take the time to brush and floss properly .\nNumber 6 .\nIs This Part of Your Body Bluish ?\nAnother visible sign from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignore is the color of your lips .\nLips in general tend to be red , but they can also take on a bluish color in people with heart problems .\nThis is because the cardiovascular system isn \u2019 t able to deliver oxygen-rich blood in the area .\nKeep in mind that people also get blue lips if they are extremely cold or have been at a high altitude

.\nWhat \u2019 s surprising is the disproportionately high rate of heart attacks and cardiac arrests that occur during that period of time .\nThe most critical thing about heart problems is that they are very time-sensitive .\nIf a person gets treatment within minutes , cardiac arrest is reversible .\nHowever , since bathrooms are private places , detection and resuscitation are always delayed , and outcomes are , therefore , extremely poor .\nAccording to one expert , the frequency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the chances of revival a dismal 13 per cent .\nSome people make the mistake of using the terms cardiac arrest , heart attack , and heart failure interchangeably .\nBut each of these conditions is slightly different , even though they are life-threatening .\nCardiac arrest is a medical

on the other hand , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stops getting oxygenated blood .\nThis usually happens because an artery that sends blood and oxygen to the heart gets blocked .\nAnd lastly , heart failure is a long-term condition that develops after the heart becomes damaged or weakened .\nThis prevents your heart from pumping blood well enough to meet your body \u2019 s needs .\nSo , why do cardiac arrests happen in the bathroom ?\nA cardiac arrest may be more likely to happen when you \u2019 re bathing , showering , or having a bowel movement because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your body .\nNumber 1 .\nBeing Constipated is Bad for Your Heart There \u2019 s a good reason why chronic constipation has been linked to a higher risk of cardiovascular events ( heart attack , stroke , sudden cardiac death ) .\nWhen you \u2019 re having a bowel movement , you may find yourself straining yourself .\nThis isn \u2019 t out of the ordinary , but it can be especially dangerous in individuals at risk of heart problems .\nWhen constipated , people instinctively perform something called a valsalva maneuver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps force out the stools .\nBut this action is also very stressful to the heart and the circulatory system , as it increases the pressure inside the chest , thus reducing the blood flow to the heart .\nThis causes the pumping of the heart to slow down , and the amount of blood being sent to nourish the brain decreases .\nAs a result , some people faint .\nTo make matters worse , after fainting , the body suddenly relaxes , which can abruptly increase the blood pressure , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain to burst ( stroke ) .\nSo , if your heart function is already compromised , excessive straining while moving one \u2019 s bowels could be a trigger for cardiac arrest , heart attack or stroke .\nTaking a shower that \u2019 s either too cold ( water temperature below 70\u00b0F ) or too hot ( water temperature above 112\u00b0F ) can quickly affect your heart rate , which can put stress on your arteries and capillaries .\nThere \u2019 s nothing better than taking a warm bath after a day \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bathing in water that \u2019 s much warmer than room temperature may trigger a cardiac event .\nThis is especially true for individuals who have preexisting cardiovascular conditions , such as high blood pressure or heart disease .\nAdditionally , you \u2019 ll also want to avoid taking a hot bath after consuming a sleeping aid or relaxant medication .\nMistakes can happen anytime .\nAnd taking the wrong dosage for certain drugs and medication can lead to sudden cardiac arrest in some cases .\nIf you keep the majority of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this may put you at greater risk of experiencing cardiac arrest in the bathroom .\nBathrooms tend to have naturally slippery surfaces and are often wet .\nFurthermore , there are sharp edges that pose additional hazards .\nWhen elderly and frail individuals slip in the bathroom , they can hit their heads , which

from happening is to spread out bath mats with suction cups to cover slippery surfaces .\nYou may also want to consider setting up a safety system with a family member who can check on you if you

in your arteries and put unnecessary strain on your heart .\nMost people rely on blood thinners and other medications ( statins ) to combat the effects of high cholesterol , but the condition can easily be managed by food alone .\nHigh cholesterol levels can lead to a buildup of plaque in the artery walls , narrowing the arteries , and causing a condition called atherosclerosis .\nthis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases risk of heart disease and stroke ( 1 ) .\nThere exist two main types of cholesterol ( 2 ) : Low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) : \u201c bad , \u201d cholesterol transports cholesterol particles throughout your body and builds up in the walls of your arteries , making them hard and narrow .\nHigh-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) : \u201c good \u201d cholesterol picks up excess cholesterol and takes it back to your liver to be cleared away through bile .\nHigh levels of LDL cholesterol is typically caused by smoking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is linked to obesity .\nTo put it simply , high cholesterol , in most cases , is simply a reflection of an unhealthy lifestyle .\nWhen cholesterol is oxidized , it leads to a build-up of plaque in the artery walls , which hardens and narrows the arteries , and causes a condition called atherosclerosis .\nPlaque is made up of cholesterol , fat , calcium , cellular waste products and fibrin , that lodge inside our arterial walls and damage the cells that are already there , causing inflammation .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a health risk only if it is oxidized .\nOxidized cholesterol and oxidized fat are the real enemies .\nOur bodies treat these as foreign substances and stimulate inflammatory cytokines to damage and kill them with inflammation .\nThe fact that LDL cholesterol is highly prone to oxidation explains why a rise in LDL cholesterol normally brings about an increase in coronary artery disease risk .\nThe oxidized cholesterol that clogs our arteries and causes coronary artery disease stems from two sources : One .\nWe acquire some of them straight from our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oils .\nTwo .\nOur bodies produce the remainder internally .\nDietary oils and fats tend to become oxidized when they are heated , dried , aged , exposed to light , and otherwise chemically processed .\nA diet high in vegetable oils is unmistakably hazardous .\nA lesser-known fact is that sugar oxidizes as well as oils and fats do .\nGlucose , and especially fructose , produce many oxidation products when they are aged , heated , or otherwise processed .\nStudies have shown that people who are at serious risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they need bypass surgery have high oxidized LDL cholesterol , not normal LDL cholesterol .\nLuckily , it \u2019 s possible to get antioxidants from foods to neutralize free radicals and reverse the damage they cause to cells and organs .\nLet \u2019 s get to our cholesterol-busting recipe with 3 natural ingredients .\nThis recipe provides your body with nutrients that can help break down bad cholesterol and clear your arteries as you transition into a healthier lifestyle .\n\u2022 Scrub lemons properly to clean the rind , but do not peel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ginger and garlic .\n\u2022 Crush the garlic and let it sit for 15 minutes .\nThis will activate the allicin .\n\u2022 Place everything but the water in a blender and pulse until smooth .\n\u2022 In a medium saucepan , add water and the paste and warm over

of oxygen your body is able to use at any given time .\nWhen lung capacity decreases your risk of heart failure increases .\nUnfortunately , the ordinary breathing that we do daily isn \u2019 t enough to keep oxygen flowing at peak levels .\nJust like the rest of your body , your lungs thrive on movement .\nThis means that you need to challenge your lungs with more intense activity .\nHere are six ways to achieve this .\nThese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity and make it easier to get all the oxygen your body needs .\nThere \u2019 s nothing else that will make your lungs stronger than doing cardio .\nYou can do this by running , swimming or even cycling .\nDoing cardio teaches your lungs to deliver more oxygen to your bloodstream quicker , as well as becoming more efficient at removing carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) from your body .\nWhat happens to your lungs when you run ?\n\u2022 The endurance capacity of your respiratory muscles \u2013 including the diaphragm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper , fuller and more efficient breaths when you run .\n\u2022 With regular training you grow more capillaries , which means you can get more oxygen to your muscles quicker .\n\u2022 The more you run , the more alveoli you

seconds rest .\nRepeat this cycle for up to 15 to 20 minutes .\nIf you \u2019 re just starting out , you can increase the resting period to 300 seconds and gradually decrease it as your body starts to adapt .\nThe second type of cardio that helps train your lungs is zone 2 cardio .\nThis is a form of cardio where you \u2019 re going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a conversation .\nAim to do 150 to 180 minutes a week of this type of cardio .\nWhile exercising is one of the best ways to build stronger lungs , there are other things you can do to keep your lungs functioning properly .\nHere are some simple breathing techniques you can do almost anytime of the day .\nEver wondered how opera singers never seem to run out of breath ?\nThis is the technique that they use to increase their lung capacity .\nDiaphragmatic breathing uses the awareness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the organs in the abdomen from the lungs .\nBy concentrating on lowering the diaphragm as you breathe in , you \u2019 ll get a much deeper inhale .\nThese techniques work well for anyone who has lung problems related to asthma , emphysema and chronic bronchitis , as well as healthy individuals .\nStep 1 \u2013 Inhale through your nose and focus on deeply expanding your belly .\nDo this for 4 seconds .\nStep 2 \u2013 Hold for 6 seconds Step 3 \u2013 Breathe out through your nose for 8 seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes .\nSince the lungs are soft structures , they can only take up as much space as you give them .\nHaving good posture can make a big difference .\nYou \u2019 ll want to bring your shoulder blades back , push your tongue against the roof of your mouth and lift your chest upwards .\nIt sounds weird , but the tongue part will automatically put your head in an upright position .\nThis technique works regardless if you \u2019 re sitting or standing .\nGo ahead and try it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to breathe deeply .\nThe same reason why opera singers have terrific lungs can be applied to playing a brass instrument .\nNot only is this a great way to learn something new or keep your brain engaged , it \u2019 s a guaranteed way to build stronger lungs , which results in better air efficiency .\nLots of doctors recommend it for people with asthma .\nThis technique goes hand in hand with meditation and yoga .\nIt can be used to help you find your focus while also increasing your lung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is prolong the length of your inhalations and exhalations .\nStart by counting how long one of your regular breath takes .\nIf it takes to the count of five to inhale , it should take to the count of five to exhale .\nTry

brain cells that naturally die off each day .\nBut some bad habits can speed up the loss of brain cells and negatively impact your mental health .\nLosing too many neurons early in life can increase your risk of cognitive problems later in life like brain fog , memory loss , and other brain disorders .\nUnlike other cells in your body that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you lose aren \u2019 t coming back .\nAt least , not in the amounts that would be required to replace the loss .\nFor example , a stroke can kill two million neurons ( type of brain cell ) per minute .\nMeanwhile , your hippocampus , the part of the brain that \u2019 s vital for learning and memory can only create about 1,400 neurons per day .\nAs you can see , even though the brain is one of the most complex structures in existence , it is also incredibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you \u2019 ll want to avoid that \u2019 s quickly killing your brain cells .\nUnder normal circumstances , stress isn \u2019 t harmful .\nYour \u201c fight or flight \u201d response is there to help you deal with danger or react to emergencies .\nStress is only truly harmful when it \u2019 s in excess .\nWhen that happens , your brain cells pay the price .\nStress triggers the release of a hormone called cortisol .\nThis chemical signals the neurons in the prefrontal cortex to disconnect and stop firing .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ your brain in charge of logic and reasoning .\nStudies have found that high levels of cortisol wear down the brain \u2019 s ability to function properly .\nIn addition , consistent elevated stress levels can kill brain cells , which can cause parts of the brain to shrink .\nSome of the best methods for reducing stress include breathing exercises , yoga , adaptogenic herbs , meditation and therapy .\nHere are some additional ideas on what you can do to help manage your stress levels : \u2022 Taking a \u201c time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a stressful situation .\n\u2022 Repeating an internal \u201c mantra , \u201d such as \u201c Everything \u2019 s going to be okay.\n\u201d \u2022 Going for a walk or taking some other type of physical action to get your energy out of your body .\n\u2022 Using mindfulness , such as focusing on something using your senses .\nConsuming more sugar than you should occasionally is not a big deal .\nHowever , when it becomes a habit to grab a soda for lunch , and have ice cream after every meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snacks with you in the car , eventually the problems will begin to build up .\nHaving too much sugar floating inside your head is lethal to brain cells .\nNeurons are susceptible to damage as a result of poor blood-glucose control .\nThe long-term effects of poor control are associated with the accelerated death of neurons , and dementia \u2013 notably Alzheimer \u2019 s disease .\nIt \u2019 s time to stand up and do something about it .\nWhile leading a sedentary lifestyle doesn \u2019 t directly kill brain cells , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exercise happen to be killers .\nThat \u2019 s because exercise helps lower stress levels , improves blood sugar control , and even helps promote neurogenesis .\nBy not exercising , you indirectly set your brain cells up for an early death .\nWhen it comes to exercising you don \u2019 t have to workout to the point of fainting or exhaustion .\nYou just need to start somewhere and slowly progress .\nEvery day your body is exposed to thousands of free radicals in the form of air pollution , hazardous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toxic compounds accelerate aging in your whole body , including your brain .\nAir pollution has often been shown to be harmful to the lungs and heart , but the latest research shows that some airborne pollutants can also bypass the blood-brain barrier and lead to brain disorders .\nResearchers have found that tiny particles from air pollution can travel from your lungs to your blood , and then pass through the brain-blood barrier .\nOnce inside the brain , these harmful particles can cause inflammation and accelerate the aging process of brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFortunately , your body is able to use antioxidants to prevent this from happening .\nWhile there are many antioxidants that can be found in nature , some are more useful to the brain .\nThe most well-known include carotenoids and flavonoids , as well as important vitamins and minerals .\nThe majority of antioxidants you get from your diet are mostly found in fruits and vegetables .\nThe brighter the color , the higher the level of disease-fighting antioxidants in that particular food .\nHere \u2019 s a list of nutrients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carotenoids are found in leafy green vegetables like spinach , kale , and broccoli .\nThey help prevent brain inflammation , oxidative stress , and the negative effects of free radicals .\n\u2022 Flavonoids can be found in blueberries , grapes , cocoa , dark chocolate , and tea .\n\u2022 Vitamin C is in pretty much every plant food you can imagine .\nThe highest amount can be found in bell peppers .\n\u2022 Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to memory loss , dementia , and Alzheimer \u2019 s .\nYour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sunlight .\n\u2022 Vitamin E is a fat-soluble antioxidant that \u2019 s easily able to cross the blood-brain barrier .\nGood sources of vitamin E include Nuts , seeds , dark-colored fruits , and vegetables .\n\u2022 Selenium is a mineral with antioxidant properties that can be found in shellfish , chicken , and Brazil nuts .\n5 .\nNot getting enough beauty sleep Sleep is probably one of the most important habits for brain health .\nLosing sleep every now and then isn \u2019 t a big issue .\nAt most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grumpy , and out of focus .\nBut a habit of poor sleep can wreak havoc on your brain and mental health .\nThat \u2019 s because sleep is the time your body uses for recovery .\nAnd your brain in particular uses this time to flush out toxins and waste products linked to Alzheimer \u2019 s and dementia .\nIf you \u2019 re consistently burning the midnight oil , you may be burning out brain cells as well .\nOne study found that staying awake for too long can damage brain cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current research shows a strong correlation between mental health problems and sleep deprivation .\nAccording to the Sleep Health Foundation , almost 60 to 90 percent of patients with depression also have insomnia .\nAnd more than half of all insomnia cases are associated with depression , anxiety , or psychological stress , according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness .\nIf you have trouble sleeping , here are some sleeping tips you can use : \u2022 If you can \u2019 t fall asleep within 20-30 minutes of trying , get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 minutes like reading a book , then try again .\n\u2022 Some people work better in the mornings , while others work best at night .\nAdjust your sleep schedule accordingly .\n\u2022 If you enjoy taking naps .\nDon \u2019 t nap for more than 30 minutes .\n\u2022 If stress is keeping you up , try taking a bath with magnesium , which is a well-known relaxation mineral .\n\u2022 Avoid sleeping on your stomach .\nIt \u2019 s considered the worst sleeping position , as it puts a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your back .\n\u2022 Listening to calming sounds or white noise can help you fall asleep .\nThere are lots of websites or apps that let you play forest sounds , rain , or static noise .\nInterestingly enough , only about 3 % of the world \u2019 s population possesses a gene that allows them to function just fine with only 6 hours of sleep per day .\nResearchers still don \u2019 t know to this day whether this is healthy or not .\n6 .\nGetting drunk too often Going out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month isn \u2019 t much of an issue long-term .\nBut if you \u2019 re drinking heavily or binge drinking often , you should consider reaching out for help .\nAlcohol is a neurotoxin that can damage neurons and even kill them .\nWhen this occurs , it makes it more difficult for healthy neurons to communicate .\nSimilar to not exercising , alcohol may also kill brain cells indirectly by increasing your risk of strokes , head injuries , and accidents .\nEveryone knows that cigarettes are terrible for your lungs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its effects on the brain .\nThere are plenty of studies that have found that people who smoke cigarettes experience faster cognitive decline than nonsmokers .\nSmoking also increases your risk of dementia , a condition that can affect memory , thinking abilities , language skills , judgement , and behavior .\nIn one study , researchers found that smokers , compared to nonsmokers , had greater amounts of age-related brain volume loss in several areas of the brain .\nEven if you aren \u2019 t able to fix all of your bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small step in the right direction can help slow down brain cell death .\nAnd one last thing before you head off .\nLosing a few million neurons won \u2019 t automatically make you \u201c dumber.\n\u201d Thanks to something called neuroplasticity , your brain is able to adapt and recover much of its previous function .\nThis is why some people who survive a stroke can return back to living a normal life .\nSurviving neurons simply make new connections and take on more work to compensate for the losses .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid having a stroke in the first place .\nAnd that

.\nJust make sure you don \u2019 t floss too hard .\nFlossing too deep can cause your gums to recede over time .\nOnce this happens , you \u2019 ll start to experience tooth pain because the areas of the tooth being exposed have thin enamel .\nWith extreme cases , the root of the tooth can be exposed causing even further tooth pain .\nToothpicks were created to remove gunk stuck between the teeth .\nHowever , misusing toothpicks can cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the teeth .\nAlso , shoving toothpick deep within the crack of your teeth causes the teeth to shift and form gaps .\nProper hydration is an

your local market to add its incredible health benefits to your daily meals !\nOne medium papaya provides 224 % of your recommended daily value ( RDV ) of vitamin C. It also contains high levels of fiber and potassium .\nVitamin C is needed to manufacture collagen \u2013 the \u201c glue \u201d that connects your tissues and cells .\nIt keeps your arteries strong , yet pliable , as they flex and contract with the pulsing of blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitamin C , tears appear in the arteries and your body packs cholesterol into these cracks .\nOver time , cholesterol builds up into plaque , especially if you eat refined carbs and unnatural fats that are \u201c sticky \u201d like margarine , corn oils , and vegetable oils .\nVitamin C helps to repair damaged arterial walls , and thus prevent hardening of the arteries , lower blood pressure , and regulate blood sugar .\nTo get these cardioprotective benefits , eat vitamin C from whole foods and NOT ascorbic acid .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ means you must get what you need from your diet every day .\nRunners up in vitamin C content are not citrus , as you might expect .\nBell peppers ( 157 % of daily value ) , broccoli ( 135 % ) , and Brussels sprouts ( 129 % ) give you far more of this essential heart nutrient than citrus !\nThis exotic fruit contains highly beneficial compounds not found in any other food .\nPunicalagin and punicic acid showed scientifically proven results in lowering LDL \u201c bad \u201d cholesterol , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and regulating blood pressure by a whopping 12 % across study participants .\nThese results are based on participants consuming one ounce of pomegranate juice per day for one year .\nSome patients saw results in as little as two weeks .\nThe control group that didn \u2019 t consume the juice saw a 9 % INCREASE in arterial plaque over the course of the study .\nPomegranates are anti-inflammatory , which is a key bio-marker for heart disease .\nThis fruit not only brings your LDL cholesterol down , it prevents LDL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cholesterol floats in your bloodstream and ultimately clings to arterial walls .\nOne of the best things you \u2019 ll find in eggs is vitamin K2 , also called menaquinone .\nDifferent from vitamin K , K2 is in a category by itself .\nEgg yolks contain 30X more vitamin K2 than egg white .\nAnd eggs from pastured chicken contain more K2 than grain-fed chickens in cages .\nVitamin K1 , which is called phylloquinone , is mostly found in leafy green vegetables .\nIt \u2019 s required by your liver to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for calcium allocation .\nIt helps to move calcium away from the blood vessels and kidneys to the bones and teeth where it is needed .\nThis is important to prevent coronary artery calcification .\nThe longer your body has calcium floating around without a home , the more likely that it will end up as plaque .\nYour body converts K1 to K2 , but it doesn \u2019 t do it efficiently , so you need it pre-formed .\nIn one Danish study involving 53,000 adults over 21 years , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and K2 intake , were 21 % less likely to be hospitalized for heart disease , stroke , and peripheral artery disease .\nYou \u2019 ll also find vitamin K2 in natto , grass-fed butter , goose liver , sauerkraut , dark meat , eel and cheese .\nCurcumin is the source of the bright

artery lining , which are leading causes of plaque buildup and blood clots .\nNot only is curcumin powerful by itself , it also improves the activity of other antioxidants in your body !\nOrganic spinach is one of the best sources of natural magnesium .\nEvery cell in your body requires magnesium to live .\nThis essential element is needed for muscle tissue and nerve repair , metabolizing glucose , regulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the heart .\nThat \u2019 s because magnesium is involved in the biochemical reactions in your heart muscle that generate your heartbeat .\nStudies have shown that people with higher levels of magnesium have fewer incidents of hypertension , stroke , and diabetes .\nConversely , magnesium deficiency has been linked to a higher risk of arrhythmias ( irregular heartbeat ) , atherosclerosis ( hardening of the arteries ) , endothelial dysfunction ( damage to the arterial lining ) , and sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) .\nOne serving of spinach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is high in other nutrients as well .\nIn the United States , experts believe that as much as 80 % of the population is magnesium deficient .\nOther excellent sources of magnesium are pumpkin seeds , lima beans , almonds , avocados and dark chocolate with 75-85 % cocoa .\nConsidered almost 50 % more potent than fish oil , krill oil is used more efficiently by your body .\nThat means every dose provides greater heart health benefit- without the \u201c fishy \u201d burps .\nKrill oil is packed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acid ( DHA ) \u2014 omega-3 fatty acids long recognized as necessary for a well-running heart .\nOmega-3s lower both cholesterol and triglycerides .\nEven in people with normal triglyceride levels , omega-3s can reduce inflammation and high blood pressure and the risk of atherosclerosis .\nOther outstanding sources of heart-healthy omega-3s are sardines , wild salmon , mackerel , halibut , tuna , walnuts , chia seeds , hemp seeds , flaxseeds , seaweed , and algae ( spirulina and chlorella ) .\nFreshly cut or chopped garlic is one of nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease , diabetes and many other serious illnesses .\nAll forms of garlic are good for you and add layers of flavor to a variety of dishes .\nHowever , only fresh garlic emits hydrogen sulfide when chopped or crushed .\nThe gas dissipates when garlic is cooked , dried , or processed .\nThis compound relaxes your blood vessels , which keeps your blood pressure in check .\nGarlic also increases nitric oxide , which dilates your blood vessels .\nThe primary sulfur compound found in garlic is called allicin .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vitamin C , and manganese .\nStudies show that garlic naturally lowers LDL \u201c bad \u201d cholesterol , and is just as effective in reducing hypertension and slowing the buildup of arterial plaque as ACE inhibitor drugs .\nDon \u2019 t listen to the hype about the saturated fat content in coconut oil .\nStudies have proven time and again that the medium-chain triglycerides ( MCTs ) in coconut oil are used by your liver for clean fuel called ketone bodies .\nThis unique property creates better energy levels that result in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 120 more calories per day .\nIn places of the world where the coconut is a staple of daily diet , the population is incredibly healthy .\nThey have fewer incidents of stroke or heart disease while consuming 60 % of their calories from coconut .\nDespite being 90 % saturated fat , coconut oil helps to lower LDL cholesterol and raise HDL cholesterol .\nSome studies have found that it lowers triglycerides and reduces visceral abdominal fat \u2013 a major risk factor for heart attack and stroke .\nThis is the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis ancient beverage does more than improve brain function , prevent neurodegenerative disease , and fight cancer .\nAny type of green tea will do , so long as it \u2019 s loose leaf \u2013 and preferably organic .\nBlack tea and oolong tea are also excellent for heart health .\nThe results of a study of 40,530 Japanese adults showed that people who drank more than five cups of green tea a day had a 26 % lower risk of death from heart attacks and strokes compared to those who drank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polyphenols found in the tea leaves , called catechins , fight oxidative stress and inflammation that are major underlying causes of many diseases , including heart disease .\nEpigallocatechin gallate ( EGCG ) is the major active catechin in green tea .\nDrinking three cups a day is shown to ease hardening of the arteries , regulate cholesterol levels , and reduce body-wide inflammation .\nIf you \u2019 re a meat eater , the type of meat you eat is just as important as how much you eat .\nGrass-fed cattle are raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have any antibiotics or growth hormones .\nThe result is beef with lower unhealthy fat , higher levels of healthy fats such as conjugated linoleic acid ( CLA ) , more omega-3s , and more nutrients overall .\nCommercially raised cattle eat grain feed with a history of bacterial contamination , junk fillers , and GMO ingredients such as corn .\nLean meat with a fat content of less than 10 % is best for your heart .\nThe L-carnitine content is the highest in beef .\nOther lesser sources include seafood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red meat has more than triple of this valuable nutrient .\nCarnitine is an amino acid that helps get fat cells to where they \u2019 re needed for energy .\nIt has been effective in controlling weight , reducing the risk of heart attack , sharpening cognition , and helping the body use oxygen and nutrients more efficiently .\nOur bodies can make carnitine , but production decreases as we age .\nIn several studies , carnitine has been shown to increase the chance of survival after a heart event and improve tolerance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest pain .\nIt also helps regulate LDL and HDL cholesterol levels , and lowers amounts of lipoprotein ( a ) , which places diabetics at a higher risk of stroke and heart failure .\nAnother huge bonus of grass-fed beef is that it contains coenzyme Q10 ( CoQ10 ) \u2013 another incredible nutrient that is primarily found in beef , poultry , and seafood .\nA deficiency of CoQ10 is common in patients who experience severe heart events .\nPost-surgery , CoQ10 aids in healing and better blood flow throughout the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and relieves chest pain .\nYou can supplement these vital nutrients if you aren \u2019 t a meat eater .\nHowever , if you love the occasional steak , choose grass-fed beef as a nutritional boost .", "author":

potatoes .\nKeep on reading to learn how you can eat carbohydrates without having to worry about your blood sugar levels spiking .\n1 .\nCook it and let it cool Cooking and cooling carbohydrate-rich foods like rice , potatoes , and oats before eating them can significantly lower their impact on your blood sugar and insulin levels .\nOne study found that cooking rice and then cooling it for 24

insulinemic features commonly associated with potato meals can be reduced by refrigerating the potatoes before eating them .\nSo , what \u2019 s going on ?\nHow can these carb-rich foods have such different impacts on your blood sugar and insulin just by changing their cooking method ?\nAccording to the research , when these foods cool down after being cooked , some of the starch they contain slowly transforms into resistant starch .\nAs the name implies , these types of starches are resistant to digestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being digested , which is similar to soluble fiber .\nAnd because they

results showed that the group that consumed the ACV were up to 34 percent more insulin sensitive an hour after eating compared to the group that consumed the placebo .\nThe reason why vinegar works is because it contains acetic acid , which increases the speed at which our muscles can absorb glucose .\nEach time we consume carbs , they are broken down into single sugar molecules and absorbed in our

the root cause of acid reflux and heartburn , and what you can do to stop the pain and discomfort forever .\nContrary to popular belief , that burning sensation you get in your chest after eating a full meal or certain foods isn \u2019 t caused by having too much stomach acid .\nAcid reflux and heartburn occur when the lower esophageal sphincter ( LES ) fails to close completely , allowing stomach acid to splash into the esophagus .\nNinety percent of the time , the reason for the LES malfunction is due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as hypochlorhydria .\nThat \u2019 s because adequate stomach acid levels are required to signal the lower esophageal sphincter to close .\nUnfortunately , stomach acid levels decline with age , poor nutrition , and stress .\nStudies have found that 30 to 40 % of men and women over the age of 60 , have little to no acid secretion because of atrophic gastritis-chronic inflammation of the stomach lining .\nIf hypochlorhydria is untreated , and heartburn happens more than twice a week , it can develop into GERD or Gastroesophageal Reflux @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complications , like scarring , ulceration , and cancer of the esophagus .\nResearchers estimate that about 20 percent of people in the United States have GERD .\nOther than heartburn , acid reflux and GERD may cause symptoms like tasting regurgitated acid , difficulty swallowing , sore throat , dry cough , hiccups , bloating , dark bowels , nausea , vomiting , severe cramping , and pain when lying down .\nFor decades , the medical establishment has treated people suffering from heartburn and GERD by prescribing antacids or acid blockers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they don \u2019 t address the underlying cause .\nAs a result , many people who take acid blockers end up relying on them for the rest of their lives .\nThis is serious because the side effects of these medications may lead to other problems like osteoporosis , bacterial infections , and damage to both the kidneys and liver .\nTo stop acid reflux at the root , it \u2019 s important to understand why low stomach acid causes acid reflux .\nWhen food enters the stomach , it releases a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a pH of 1.5 to 3.0 .\nStomach acid , also called gastric acid , is extremely important for digesting food , particularly proteins and meats .\nIt helps kill bacteria in the food and produces enzymes needed for digestion such as pepsin .\nGastric acid signals the pyloric sphincter at the bottom of the stomach , to open and empty the mixture of food , hydrochloric acid , and enzymes ( called chyme ) into the small intestine when it reaches the right pH .\nIf you have low stomach acid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down properly , and this creates an environment that is friendly to the growth of bacteria .\nThese bacteria eat the carbohydrates fermenting in the stomach .\nThe bacterial overgrowth and poorly-digested food cause excessive pressure in the stomach .\nWhen there \u2019 s too much pressure in the stomach but the pH isn \u2019 t acidic enough for the pyloric sphincter to open , the only way for the body to release that pressure is by opening up the LES .\nThe pressure released into the esophagus causes the symptoms of heartburn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misdiagnosed as high stomach acid .\nEven if you have little stomach acid , any amount of it going from your stomach to your esophagus will cause discomfort or pain .\nThis is because your esophagus was never designed to handle stomach acid .\nWhen this happens regularly , the LES weakens and becomes \u201c leaky \u201d , making the problem worse .\nHaving low stomach acid leads to inflammation in the gut and throughout the body .\nChronic Inflammation damages your small intestine , makes it hard to digest and absorb nutrients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small intestinal bacterial overgrowth ( SIBO ) , and causes leaky gut .\nNow , you may ask : what causes low stomach acid ?\nA variety of factors can lead to low stomach acid .\nThese include aging , poor diet , chronic stress

hypothyroidism which goes untreated .\nThis is because thyroid hormone is required to produce stomach acid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bacterial infection of the stomach ) can make it harder for your stomach to produce acid .\nThis leads to poor absorption of iron and vitamin B12 and can cause SIBO .\nNext , here are the 3 steps you can take to increase stomach acid and stop acid reflux , heartburn , and GERD .\nThe first thing you can do to increase your stomach acid naturally is to take betaine hydrochloride or betaine HCL .\nBetaine is a compound that is found in food , such as grains or beets .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ betaine that works the same way as hydrochloric acid in your stomach .\nBefore you supplement with HCL , take two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar , ACV , to test if your stomach lining is ready .\nACV helps stimulate stomach acid production .\nIf you feel gastric burning , you are not yet ready for supplementation .\nInstead , take a tablespoon of ACV with each meal for 4 to 6 weeks to improve your digestion .\nDilute it in water until you can tolerate it .\nIf you do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are ready to take 1 to 2 capsules of betaine HCL with a meal .\nThis helps reduce bloating and discomfort after eating protein-rich foods .\nYou may need to increase your dosage until you no longer feel burning or discomfort , and then lower your dosage over time .\nNext , you need to make sure you \u2019 re getting enough potassium , sodium , and zinc in your diet .\nThese nutrients are needed by your body to produce stomach acid .\nKeep watching for a list of the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Third , you will want to reduce your stress levels .\nStress can cause your stomach muscles to tighten up .\nResearchers found that people with acid reflux and GERD who were anxious and stressed became more sensitive to smaller amounts of acid in the esophagus , and reported more painful symptoms .\nIt takes time to fix low stomach acid .\nIf you already suffer from acid reflux , here are FOUR things you can do to reduce inflammation and relieve the pain and discomfort .\nFirst , avoid foods that trigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GERD .\nCut back on carbohydrates ( especially refined carbs ) because they can cause bacterial overgrowth , gas , and bloating .\nGo gluten-free , because foods that contain gluten are a common cause of heartburn .\nLimit your intake of high-fat foods because they contribute to heartburn .\nUnfortunately , it \u2019 s not just fried foods , pizza , potato chips , and fast food .\nIt also includes healthy fats like cheese , nuts , and avocados .\nHigh-fat foods stimulate the release of a hormone called cholecystokinin ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triggers heartburn .\nAlso avoid foods and drinks that trigger acid reflux like peppermint , coffee , carbonated drinks , chocolates , alcohol , citrus fruits , onion , garlic , tomatoes , peppers , and spicy foods .\nNext , add these anti-inflammatory foods and drinks to soothe acid reflux and help make stomach acid .\nRoot , leafy vegetables , and legumes like potatoes , sweet potatoes , turnips , carrots , spinach , broccoli , green peas , lentils , and mushrooms .\nThese are fiber-rich and help digestion .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown rice , and quinoa .\nFermented foods like kimchi , sauerkraut , and yogurt .\nThese contain probiotics and help increase stomach acid .\nLow-fat , lean protein like chicken , fish ,

the size of a lemon while clamping on the urethra , and I \u2019 m sure you can picture the problem .\nSo , what are the symptoms of BPH ?\nWaking up frequently during the night to urinate .\nAn urgent need to pee more often .\nFeeling that the bladder is not empty .\nA stream that \u2019 s weak , slow , or stops and starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and burning sensation after ejaculation or during urination .\nIf prostate problems go untreated , the bladder will not empty fully .\nAs the volume of residual urine increases , it creates the perfect humid environment for bacteria to thrive .\nThis can cause infections in the lower urinary tract , resulting in symptoms like pain and fever .\nAs BPH reaches the final stage , acute urinary retention occurs .\nThis is extremely painful .\nIt should be pointed out that BPH , prostatitis ( inflammation of the prostate ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their early stages , making it difficult to differentiate between them .\nThe only way to know for sure is to have a doctor perform a PSA test to see if your levels are abnormally high for your age , and also examine your prostate .\nProstate-specific antigen ( PSA ) is a fluid that is produced in the prostate .\nStatistics show that roughly 25 % of men in their 40s have BPH , and this number skyrockets to a startling 80 % for men in their 70s .\nNext , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of testosterone in the body decreases , and this leads to an increase in estrogen activity , which makes the prostate cells grow faster .\nAn enzyme called aromatase converts testosterone into estrogen .\nStudies have shown that high levels of estrogen-related enzymes lead to prostate decline .\nA modern-day problem is that men are exposed to many estrogens in processed foods , commercial meats and dairy , plastics , and personal care products .\nElevated levels of estrogen in men can lead to problems like a loss in muscle strength and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss , and an enlarged prostate .\nAdditionally , having more visceral abdominal fat increases the risk of developing diabetes , heart disease , and cancer .\nWorst of all , high estrogen levels decrease the body \u2019 s ability to produce testosterone and free testosterone .\nAs you can see , it is particularly important to keep estrogen from harming prostate health .\nAnother theory about BPH focuses on dihydrotestosterone or DHT and the activity of an enzyme called 5-alpha-reductase .\nThis enzyme converts testosterone in the body to DHT , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than simple testosterone .\nAs men age , the activity of 5-alpha-reductase increases , which leads to a decrease in the ratio of testosterone to DHT .\nDHT may make prostate cells grow , leading to hyperplasia .\nLower levels of testosterone or a faster decline over time are important factors that trigger BPH .\nNow , let \u2019 s look at the 7 vitamins that help shrink an enlarged prostate by targeting the causes .\nWe use the word \u201c vitamins \u201d broadly to include minerals and phytosterols or natural compounds found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if any , side effects compared to BPH medications .\nIt \u2019 s important to note that one ingredient alone may not get the job done .\nInstead , it \u2019 s best to combine nutrients to effectively address BPH .\nFirst up , we have Number 7 .\nZinc .\nDid you know the prostate has the highest levels of zinc in a man \u2019 s body ?\nZinc is important for making testosterone and keeping the prostate healthy .\nZinc intake helps prevent and reverse prostate enlargement in two ways .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ excessive breakdown of testosterone into DHT by the enzyme 5-alpha- reductase .\nTwo .\nZinc helps to block the conversion of testosterone by the enzyme aromatase to estradiol , the main type of estrogen .\nThe Journal of Nutrition published a study that found that a zinc-deficient diet leads to lower levels of testosterone and excess estrogen .\nA study from 2011 showed that men with BPH had less zinc in their prostate tissue than normal .\nThe study also found that these men were losing more zinc through their urine .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zinc is only 11 mg , but most men do not get even this amount .\nPumpkin seeds and pumpkin seed oil are excellent sources of zinc .\nYou can significantly increase your zinc levels by eating 2 ounces of pumpkin seeds per day .\nPumpkin seed oil contains carotenoids and omega-3 fatty acids .\nStudies have found that men who consume more carotenoids have a decreased chance of developing BPH .\nSee our recommended pumpkin seed oil in the link below .\nOther excellent sources of zinc are meat , fish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best results for treating BPH are seen with zinc picolinate .\nMany men experience improved urine flow , more complete bladder emptying , and less sleep disruption from nighttime bathroom visits .\nIf you decide to supplement with zinc , take 30 mg one to two times daily with food .\nRemember to also take a copper supplement of 2 mg per day , since these two minerals compete for absorption .\nIf you don \u2019 t , zinc will win out and you may develop a copper deficiency .\nComing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ & Lycopene .\nA recent 4-year study in China looked at the effects of diet on BPH symptoms in 2,000 men aged 65 and older .\nResearchers found that men with diets high in fruits and vegetables \u2014 especially leafy , dark vegetables and tomatoes \u2014 had less BPH , fewer symptoms of BPH , and were less likely to worsen their BPH .\nResearchers believe it \u2019 s not just one nutrient , but the combinations found in a healthful diet and lifestyle that are beneficial .\nOxidative stress is thought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so this may explain why powerful antioxidants such as vitamin C ( in fruits and vegetables ) and lycopene ( in cooked tomatoes ) may help reduce symptoms of hyperplasia .\nMoving on to Number 5 , we have Beta-sitosterol .\nBeta-sitosterol is a phytosterol that helps reduce blood levels of cholesterol .\nIn studies where men received 130 mg of beta-sitosterol daily , there was reduced swelling in the prostate and a significant improvement in urinary flow and symptoms .\nThis was not the case for men who received a placebo .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ avocados , peanuts , almonds , kidney beans , soybeans , wheat germ , walnuts , and lentils .\nThe next four nutrients also contain beta-sitosterol .\nNext on our list is Number 4 .\nSaw Palmetto .\nSaw palmetto ( Serenoa Repens ) berry extract may be the most well-known natural treatment for prostate problems .\nHowever , it is most useful only for men with mild-to-moderate BPH symptoms .\nIf you supplement with saw palmetto extract , take 320 mg a day of a high-quality liposterolic extract , standardized for 80 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extract can help improve your prostate health by lowering your levels of DHT .\nResearch showed that saw palmetto in combination with lycopene and selenium helped to reverse lower urinary tract symptoms and shrink the size of the prostate in men with BPH .\nSaw palmetto is not a prostate panacea .\nTo receive the full desired effects , it needs to be combined with the additional nutrients listed here .\nGetting into our top 3 , Number 3 is Pygeum .\nPygeum africanum is an extract of the African cherry tree that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrink the prostate in men with BPH .\nIt has been used for centuries to treat various urinary problems .\nAt typical doses of 100 mg per day , the extract can significantly improve International Prostate Symptom Scores ( IPSS ) , reduce the frequency of nighttime urination , and increase peak urinary flow rates and quality of life .\nThis extract has also shown evidence of potent anti-cancer effects .\nStudies have shown that the benefits of saw palmetto and pygeum extracts are significantly enhanced when taken with beta-sitosterol and pumpkin seed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass pollen extract can significantly improve self-rated urinary symptoms in men with BPH .\nMen who use this extract are twice as likely to show improvement in nocturnal urination .\nIn addition , these men showed a significant reduction in prostate size and improvements in reported pain and quality of life .\nAnd at Number 1 , we have Stinging nettle root .\nStinging nettle root ( Urtica dioica ) blocks DHT production and has been used as a therapy for BPH and hair loss for a long time .\nStudies have shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieving BPH symptoms and in shrinking the size of the prostate .\nRepeated studies also show that saw palmetto , when combined with nettle extract , can reduce nighttime urination by one episode per night .\nThis is a significant difference .\nAn added benefit of stinging nettle is that it promotes increases in the levels of serum-free testosterone with no increase in total testosterone .\nAmounts used in successful studies range from 6 to 12 mL of tincture per day in divided doses , or 120 mg capsules twice a day .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional first , if you have underlying health conditions or are taking medications .\nIn addition , incorporate these lifestyle habits to take care of your prostate .\nStay lean to keep estrogen levels in check .\nAvoid commercial toiletry products , these contain estrogenic and toxic chemicals .\nUse natural soap and shampoo .\nEat a healthy , balanced diet that is high in fiber , protein , carbs , healthy fats and nuts , fresh fruits and vegetables , and low in sugars and processed foods .\nBoost your testosterone levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , minimize stress and cortisol levels , get enough sunlight or vitamin D and have plenty of restful high-quality sleep .", "author": "DailyHealthPost Editorial", "url": "https://dailyhealthpost.com/vitamins-to-shrink-enlarged-prostate/", "published": "Mon, 21

"source": "dailyhealthpost", "title": "Top 7 Vitamins to Increase Blood Flow and Circulation", "content": "Today , we look at the symptoms and causes of poor circulation in the body , and how we can fix this with vitamins that improve blood flow .\nPoor circulation means either a lack of blood flow to certain parts of the body , such as the extremities , or a lack of blood flow throughout the body .\nIn either case , it \u2019 s not good news .\nBlood carries oxygen and nutrients to every cell in the body .\nThis is necessary for the cells to function properly .\nBlood also carries away waste .\nIf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accumulate in the cells , which further affects their function .\nAs we age , our circulation decreases , and this can lead to accelerated aging .\nCells that are deprived of vital nutrition are damaged more easily by free radicals , and over time , the body \u2019 s systems start breaking down .\nThe heart has to work harder to pump blood because your body isn \u2019 t getting enough oxygen .\nPoor circulation is a widespread problem that doesn \u2019 t get the attention it deserves .\nThis condition can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribute to disease .\nNumbness and tingling in feet and hands .\nHands and feet that are always cold .\nSwelling and fluid buildup , known as edema .\nDigestive problems such as cramping , abdominal pain , diarrhea , constipation , and bloody stools .\nMuscle cramps and joint pain in the hands , feet , legs , and arms .\nVaricose veins in the legs that get worse .\nLeg ulcers that are difficult to heal .\nConversely , improved blood flow can take you to a whole new level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , what causes poor blood circulation ?\nThe factors that cause chronic diseases also give rise to poor blood circulation .\nOne .\nA diet high in processed foods including refined sugars and carbs , and inflammatory oils , and low in fruits , vegetables , and healthy fats from fish and protein .\nThis type of eating contributes to poor circulation because : -You may be missing the nutrients you need to produce nitric oxide and support other processes for blood circulation .\nFor example , deficiencies in iron , vitamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and magnesium can reduce the body \u2019 s ability to produce red blood cells that carry oxygen .\n-When blood sugar rises , it damages the micro vessels and decreases the body \u2019 s ability to produce nitric oxide .\n-Inflammatory food triggers inflammation in the body , which then affects circulation .\n-Making poor dietary choices leads to obesity and chronic disease .\nObesity increases the risks of varicose veins and blood pressure problems .\nTwo .\nA sedentary and lifestyle .\nToo much sitting constricts blood flow .\nThree .\nChronic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blood flow is directed away from the digestive system and internal organs , and toward the muscles to prepare for \u201c fight or flight.\n\u201d Chronic stress contributes to high blood sugar , weight gain , and lower moods\u2014all of which can lead to poor circulation .\nFour .\nChronic diseases cause narrowing of the arteries and reduced blood flow .\nThis includes atherosclerosis ( plaque buildup in blood vessels ) , Raynaud \u2019 s disease ( an autoimmune disease that affects fingers and toes ) , diabetes , and neuropathy ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis habit interferes with blood flow and increases the risks of stroke , heart attack , and cardiovascular disease .\nAre you enjoying the information ?\nMake sure you like , share and subscribe and click on notifications so you never miss a video .\nNext , to understand how we can increase circulation , we need to understand nitric oxide .\nNitric oxide is a vasodilator or a compound that relaxes and widens your arteries and veins .\nThe endothelial cells that line your blood vessels produce nitric oxide .\nEnzymes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the amino acid called l-arginine .\nThis process requires oxygen and micronutrients\u2014both of which are important for healthy circulation .\nHaving poor circulation makes it difficult for cells to produce nitric oxide , and herein lies the problem .\nTo optimize circulation , you need healthy nitric oxide levels , but to optimize nitric oxide production , you need healthy circulation .\nThe rest of this video will explain how you can get out of this vicious cycle of low-nitric-oxide poor circulation .\nBesides circulation support , nitric oxide is essential for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signals and reducing inflammation .\nThe micro vessels in the body , which make up 74 % of the entire vascular system , rely on nitric oxide to deliver oxygen and nutrition to the heart and the rest of the body .\nWhen there isn \u2019 t enough nitric oxide , circulation decreases and results in the symptoms mentioned earlier .\nNext , let \u2019 s look at the vitamins that improve blood flow by increasing nitric oxide levels .\nWe use the word vitamins broadly to include natural compounds like amino acids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ l-arginine is a precursor to nitric oxide in the body .\nWhen you increase the amount of l-arginine available to cells that produce nitric oxide , they produce more .\nHowever , l-arginine alone may not be enough to have sustained effects in dilating blood vessels .\nAfter you turn 45 , your digestive system has a harder time converting l-arginine into nitric oxide .\nSo , just taking an l-arginine supplement , or eating protein-rich foods that contain l-arginine , like fish , red meat , poultry , soybeans , whole grains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not have much effect on nitric oxide levels .\nThe solution is to combine this amino acid with the next nutrient .\nL-citrulline is a non-essential amino acid that is efficiently turned into L-arginine in the kidneys .\nThis makes it a good supplementation choice for increasing nitric oxide synthesis in the body .\nL-citrulline supports healthy blood pressure , promotes sharper memory and focus , and boosts your libido .\nStudies show that l-citrulline works well , even if you \u2019 re in your 60s , 70s , 80s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ l-arginine production and is recycled back to l-arginine .\nStudies show that when you combine l-arginine and l-citrulline , nitric oxide is produced more effectively at a lower dose , than if you used more of either amino acid .\nWatermelon is the king of citrulline-rich fruits .\nThe word citrulline comes from \u201c Citrullus , \u201d which is the Latin word for watermelon .\nOther citrulline-rich fruits include Casaba Melons , Cucumbers , and Cantaloupe .\nComing up next is Number 5 .\nBeetroot Extract .\nBeetroot is an excellent source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high in nitrates , bacteria in your saliva convert them into nitrites , which are then converted into nitric oxide .\nOther nitrate-rich foods include spinach , lettuce , carrots , arugula , cabbage , garlic , broccoli , kale , and celery .\nSupplementing with concentrated versions of these foods can help improve vasodilation and blood flow .\nBeetroot extract helps to boost your energy and endurance , plus it can help you walk longer and think more quickly on your feet .\nNext up is Number 4 .\nVitamin C. Vitamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to improve nitric oxide synthase activity .\nWhen Vitamin C is combined with dietary nitrates , it helps to increase the bioavailability of nitric oxide .\nGetting into our top 3 , Number 3 is Hawthorn Berry .\nIn traditional Chinese medicine , hawthorn berry is one of the most commonly used foods to treat high blood pressure .\nThis small , red fruit is packed with antioxidants that help open up your arteries to stimulate blood flow .\nNot only can hawthorn berry increase nitric oxide levels , but it also helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beetroot extract when you take these nutrients together .\nGlutathione is a molecule that helps with detoxification , cell repair , and immune system function .\nThis powerful antioxidant helps increase nitric oxide levels by getting rid of free radicals that damage nitric oxide molecules .\nTo keep glutathione levels high as you age , eat plenty of sulfur-rich foods like mushrooms , garlic , onions , and cruciferous vegetables .\nOr supplement with glutathione precursors like N-acetyl-cysteine or glutamine .\nAnd at Number 1 , we have Trans-resveratrol .\nTrans-resveratrol is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in grapes , red wine , and berries .\nThis antioxidant helps increase the activity of enzymes that are involved in nitric oxide synthesis .\nIt has also been shown to increase the half-life of nitric oxide , allowing it to remain active for a longer period .\nTrans-resveratrol may help to improve blood flow and circulation .\nOther than these 7 nitric oxide nutrients , consume anti-inflammatory whole foods and nitrate-rich foods to support healthy blood flow .\nLast but not least , here are two simple ways you can release more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise regularly and breathe through your nose .\nAs always ,

"Today , we look at what you can do to stop prediabetes from advancing to diabetes and prevent it from causing clogged arteries .\nMany people think prediabetes is no big deal .\nBut researchers at the American College of Cardiology found that people with prediabetes were significantly more likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke , even if they never develop diabetes .\nWhen your blood glucose levels are higher than normal , but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes , this condition is known as prediabetes .\nIn prediabetes , the fasting blood glucose level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diabetes it \u2019 s 126 and greater .\nAnd the A1C level is 5.7-6.4 % in prediabetes , and 6.5 % and greater in diabetes .\nDid you know , up to 70 % of individuals with prediabetes will eventually develop diabetes\u2013even though prediabetes is fully reversible ?\nStatistics reveal that over 96 million U.S. adults live with prediabetes\u2013and 90 % of them don \u2019 t know they have it .\nThat \u2019 s more than 1 in 3 adults !\nOr they simply brush off the symptoms as minor health problems \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , diabetes is anything but minor .\nEarly diagnosis and treatment can mean the difference between living a long , healthy life and suffering from complications .\nUncontrolled high blood sugar can cause damage to the blood vessels , nerves , heart , and kidneys .\nFirst , let \u2019 s talk about what causes prediabetes .\nPrediabetes usually occurs in people who already have insulin resistance or whose beta cells in the pancreas don \u2019 t make enough insulin to keep blood sugar in the normal range .\nLet \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat , the carbohydrates in your food are broken down into glucose , or sugar .\nThis sugar enters your bloodstream .\nSugar then enters the body \u2019 s cells with help from insulin ( a hormone produced by the pancreas ) so that it can be used as energy .\nInsulin also tells the liver , muscle , and fat cells to store any excess sugar as glycogen for later use .\nWhen sugar enters our cells , it decreases the amount of sugar in our blood to a normal level .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ insulin .\nHowever , when your cells don \u2019 t react to insulin the way they \u2019 re supposed to , the extra sugar stays in your blood .\nThis condition is called insulin resistance , and it \u2019 s the underlying cause of prediabetes .\nIt isn \u2019 t exactly clear what causes insulin resistance .\nBut researchers think excess weight and lack of physical activity are major factors .\nAnother cause of prediabetes is when beta cells in the pancreas can no longer produce enough insulin .\nThis happens as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carbohydrates at a high frequency .\nThe pancreas has to work extra hard to keep releasing insulin to control blood sugar levels .\nEventually , the beta cells become exhausted and can no longer pump out that much insulin .\nSo sugar rises and stays in the blood after you eat .\nAre you enjoying the information ?\nMake sure you like , share and subscribe and click on notifications so you never miss a video .\nNext , not many people are aware that prediabetes can cause clogged arteries , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens .\nAs sugar builds up and reaches dangerous levels , it creates the perfect environment for widespread inflammation .\nInflammation damages the lining of your blood vessels and creates uneven surfaces in the smooth muscle cells .\nThis allows cholesterol to lodge in your artery walls and form plaque along with fats , calcium , and other substances .\nPlaque can grow large enough to significantly reduce blood flow through an artery .\nBut that \u2019 s not all .\nPlaque accumulation also makes your body release immune cells to attack the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rupture and trigger a blood clot to form .\nA clot is dangerous because it may further narrow the artery or completely block it , which could lead to a heart attack or stroke .\nSo , how can you know if you have prediabetes ?\nHere are 11 symptoms .\nThis is because glucose in the blood can not be easily converted into energy after eating .\nThis is due to poor circulation in damaged blood vessels .\nOpen wounds are called diabetic ulcers .\nToo much sugar in the brain makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to focus .\nAs stress increases , more cortisol is released and raises sugar levels by releasing stored glucose into the bloodstream .\nWhen sugar stays in the blood , it causes your cells to burn fat and muscle for energy , and this can cause sudden weight loss .\nHowever , insulin resistance makes you hungry all the time , so you eat more .\nYour body stores the extra sugar as fat , which leads to weight gain .\nBoth overweight and thin people can be prediabetic .\nWhen there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your kidneys can \u2019 t re-absorb all the sugar , so it leaves your body through urine .\nThis makes you go to the bathroom more often .\nAs a result , your body craves more water , your mouth feels dry , and you feel thirsty all the time .\nAnd the cycle continues .\nNumber 6 .\nNumbness and tingling of feet and hands .\nThis is because high blood sugar damages the nerves and causes them to misfire .\nThis condition is known as neuropathy .\nResearchers have found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates of gas , bloating , feeling full quickly , nausea , heartburn , and constipation .\nThis may be because their vagus nerve is damaged .\nThe vagus nerve helps control how quickly the stomach empties .\nWhen it \u2019 s damaged , food stays in the stomach for too long .\nThis is called gastroparesis .\nIf you have unexplained digestive problems , have a doctor check for prediabetes .\nPeople with prediabetes often have extra body weight .\nThis can be hard on their joints , particularly in the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ osteoarthritis .\nSome people with prediabetes experience recurring bacterial infection that starts with itchy skin .\nThe person can \u2019 t stop scratching the itch , and then their skin turns red and dissolve .\nSwelling follows and it becomes a weeping sore .\nThis is caused by naturally-present bacteria that feed on glucose and go out of control .\nOther skin conditions include acanthosis nigricans\u2013a darkened area of skin on the back of your neck , armpit , groin , or elsewhere that feels like velvet .\nSkin tags on the eyelids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are another symptom of high blood sugar .\nWhen the tiny blood vessels that supply your retina are damaged by excess sugar , they can leak blood into the retina and distort vision .\nThis condition is known as diabetic retinopathy , and it can happen in the prediabetic stage .\nEarly symptoms of diabetic retinopathy include blurred vision , floaters , loss of central vision , and dark spots in the field of vision .\nThe kidneys can be damaged even before the onset of diabetes .\nIn one extensive study , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs of kidney disease .\nThe stage of kidney disease was 3 or 4 , the same as for people with diabetes .\nNext , how can you reverse prediabetes ?\nThe most important thing you can do is to reduce the amount of sugar and refined carbs in your diet .\nIf you eat carbs and sugar , make sure you get fiber along with it .\nFiber will keep your insulin and glucose levels balanced so you don \u2019 t get a spike .\nSome fiber-rich foods are green beans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , celery , lettuce , spinach , and cruciferous vegetables .\nChoose anti-inflammatory foods that are medium to low on the glycemic index .\nControl your portion sizes .\nDrink lots of water to dilute the sugar in your bloodstream and help your kidneys flush out excess sugar .\nIt will also help reduce hunger .\nGet nutrients that improve sugar control , such as chromium , magnesium , berberine , ALA ( alpha-lipoic acid ) , apple cider vinegar , cinnamon , probiotic foods , and omega-3 fatty acids .\nExercise regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lose weight and take the load off your pancreas .\nWhen you work out , your muscle cells can absorb glucose for energy , whether or not insulin is available .\nEven walking 30 minutes every day works wonders .\nGet enough quality sleep .\nSleep deprivation increases your hunger for high-carbohydrate foods .\nIt also increases cortisol levels and triggers higher blood sugar .\nManage your stress levels to balance your hormones .\nYoga , deep meditation , or working on a hobby you enjoy will do wonders for your body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis will reduce the risk of metabolic problems .\nLastly , who is at risk for prediabetes ?\nIf you are aged 45 years and over , carry extra belly fat , lead a sedentary lifestyle , or have a family history diabetes , consider getting tested to know if you have prediabetes .\nI hope you enjoyed this video .\nClick the link below to

Potassium You May Be Ignoring (Signs, Causes, Treatment)", "content": "Does your heart regularly skip a beat ?\nDo your muscles cramp up often ?\nIs your thinking slower than it used to be ?\nIf any of these sounds like you , this could be because you have lower-than-normal levels of potassium in your body .\nThe medical name for this condition is hypokalemia .\nA full 98 % of the potassium in your body is found in your cells-and for good reason !\nPotassium is an electrolyte-this means it helps carry electrical signals to cells in your body .\nYour body uses this electricity to keep fluid balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscle cells , particularly the heart muscle cells .\nPotassium helps your heartbeat stay regular , your kidneys function properly and stop your sodium levels from spiking too high .\nPotassium deficiency is more common than you think .\nStudies show that 9 out of 10 Americans\u2014that \u2019 s upwards of 290 million people\u2014are only getting about half the 4.7 grams of this essential mineral they need each day .\nThe normal range for blood potassium is between 3.5 to 5.5 mmol/L .\nBelow this level , hypokalemia occurs .\nVery low levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 2.5 mmol/L ) can lead to irregular heart rhythms and trigger cardiac arrest\u2014which can be deadly .\nSo , what causes a potassium deficiency , and what are the symptoms that warn you of low potassium ?\nHow can you restore your potassium ?\nThis is exactly what we \u2019 ll talk about in the rest of this video .\nFirst , let \u2019 s look at what causes hypokalemia .\nA potassium deficiency is rarely caused by a low intake of fruits and vegetables alone .\nThe most common cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis happens in people who take prescription medications called diuretics or water pills , which make them urinate more often .\nThese medications are often prescribed for high blood pressure or heart disease .\nAnother reason is the excessive loss of potassium in your digestive tract .\nThis may be due to frequent vomiting , diarrhea , or laxative use .\nOther physical conditions that contribute to potassium loss include : Other medications such as insulin and antibiotics .\nLow magnesium levels .\nMagnesium actively transports potassium across your cells .\nSo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potassium levels suffer too .\nNext , what are the symptoms of hypokalemia ?\nOften , the symptoms of low potassium are easily overlooked , until they become serious .\nHigh blood pressure , or hypertension , can be caused by excess weight , genetics , or eating a lot of processed foods that are high in sodium .\nMaintaining healthy blood pressure requires the perfect balance of electrolytes .\nPotassium and sodium are electrolytes that work inversely in the body .\nWhen you eat potassium-rich foods , your kidneys get rid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells don \u2019 t have enough potassium , the kidneys reabsorb sodium back into the blood vessels , and your body holds on to more water .\nExtra water in your blood means there is extra pressure on your blood vessel walls , and this raises your blood pressure .\nPotassium helps to widen blood vessels and lower blood pressure .\nComing up next , Number 9 is \u201c Irregular Heartbeat \u201d .\nFor most people , heart palpitations or a skipped heartbeat now and then are not a big deal .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this can cause cardiac arrhythmias or an irregular heartbeat , especially for people who are at risk of heart disease .\nThis is because low potassium levels change the flow of potassium in and out of heart cells .\nAs a result , electrical signals that control your heartbeat don \u2019 t work properly , and your heart beats too fast , too slow , or irregularly .\nIf you notice any changes to your heart rate , seek medical attention right away .\nNext up , we have Number 8 .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you often experience painful cramps in your legs , a lack of potassium could be to blame .\nThis is because you lose electrolytes , including potassium , after an intense workout .\nPotassium is important for muscles because it helps relay signals from your brain to make them contract .\nIt also helps end these contractions by leaving the

"Today , we talk about the best natural remedies to help reduce plaque in your arteries and prevent cardiovascular disease .\nBut first , we need to understand what is going on behind the scenes that cause plaque to form .\nWhen the arteries are damaged , and blood flow is obstructed or even completely blocked , this condition is called atherosclerosis .\nIt starts when the endothelium becomes inflamed and develops silently over many years .\nThe endothelium is the single layer of cells that lines the inner surface of your arteries .\nAt the sites where the endothelial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form .\nPlaque is a fatty substance made up of cholesterol , calcium , cellular waste , and a blood-clotting protein called fibrin .\nAs plaque grows larger , it further damages the endothelium and triggers even more inflammation .\nThe damaged endothelial cells can not produce nitric oxide properly .\nNitric oxide is needed to relax and dilate the blood vessels .\nAs a result , your arteries become stiff and narrow .\nBlood flow to your heart , brain and other vital organs is reduced .\nThis forces your heart to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body .\nAs your immune system continues to send white blood cells to attack the plaque , it becomes unstable .\nThe plaque ruptures and forms a clot or thrombus that blocks the artery and triggers a heart attack or stroke .\nKeep watching to learn the FIRST thing you must do to reduce plaque in your arteries .\nNext , what are the symptoms of atherosclerosis ?\nWhen an artery is severely damaged , symptoms may occur , depending on which arteries are affected .\nThe arteries that lead to your heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe arteries that lead to your brain : -Arms and legs that feel numb or weak .\nThe arteries in your arms and legs : -Pain in the legs when walking .\nThe arteries that lead to your kidneys : So , what causes plaque to form in the first place ?\nYou may have heard that \u201c bad cholesterol \u201d or LDL cholesterol causes plaque .\nHowever , LDL particles do NOT grab onto artery walls on their own .\nWhat turns LDL cholesterol into deadly plaque is \u201c oxidation \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is when iron forms rust when it meets oxygen .\nStudies show that people who are at serious risk of heart attack to the extent that they need bypass surgery have high oxidized LDL cholesterol , NOT normal LDL cholesterol .\nLDL cholesterol is highly prone to oxidation .\nNext , where does oxidized cholesterol come from ?\nOne .\nWe acquire them straight from our diets when we eat oxidized fats , oils , and sugars .\nProcessed vegetable oils , sugar , and starches are easily oxidized .\nTwo .\nOur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high level of fats and LDL cholesterol relative to HDL cholesterol ( or \u201c good \u201d cholesterol ) in the blood .\nHigh LDL cholesterol is usually caused by poor diet , inactivity , obesity , smoking , and diabetes .\nTo reduce artery plaque , the first thing we must do is adjust our diet and lifestyle to limit these TWO sources .\nAre you enjoying the information ?\nMake sure you like , share and subscribe and click on notifications so you never miss a video .\nNext , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arteries and even prevent plaque from building up ?\nThe best remedy involves reducing oxidized cholesterol and adding the following nutrients as food or supplements .\nNot only does oxidation cause plaque , but it also kills the energy-producing mitochondria in your cells , like your heart cells .\nCoQ10 supports the mitochondria in energy production .\nIt is critical for heart cells because your heart needs to pump harder when your arteries are blocked by plaque .\nCoQ10 is a powerful antioxidant , so it can help stop LDL from being oxidized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than vitamin E supplements-which some studies have linked to increased risks of cancer .\nSupplementing with CoQ10 has been shown to significantly increase HDL cholesterol , reduce inflammatory markers , lower blood pressure , and even help people who have suffered a heart attack avoid complications .\nWhile we can get CoQ10 from organ meats and grass-fed beef , the quantities are small , so it \u2019 s best to supplement .\nThis is especially true if you \u2019 re on statins as this medication depletes your body \u2019 s natural store of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 45 , consider taking 100 mg of a high-absorption CoQ10 daily , like Ubiquinol , to protect your heart .\nNext up , at Number 6 , we have \u201c Vitamin C \u201d .\nYou know vitamin C is vital for a strong immune system .\nBut did you know vitamin C also keeps your arteries strong , yet pliable , as they flex and contract with the pulsing of blood ?\nIt helps manufacture collagen\u2013the glue that holds your tissues together , and this includes your blood vessels .\nWhen there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear in the arteries and cholesterol enters these cracks .\nAs an antioxidant , vitamin C has been shown in one study to stop LDL from oxidizing by 64 % .\nTo get these cardioprotective benefits , eat vitamin C from whole foods , or get it from a whole foods supplement , and NOT synthetic ascorbic acid .\nFoods that are rich in vitamin C include bell peppers , broccoli , Brussels sprouts , and citrus fruits .\nComing up next , Number 5 is \u201c Vitamin B6 , B12 , folate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep your brain young and healthy .\nA deficiency can damage the endothelium through high levels of homocysteine in the blood .\nHomocysteine is an amino acid used by the body to build and sustain tissue .\nWhen you eat red meat and dairy products , the amino acid methionine converts to homocysteine .\nYour body needs vitamins B6 , B12 , and folate to use homocysteine properly .\nWhen levels of these B vitamins are low , homocysteine levels rise .\nThis causes the smooth muscle cells that lie just beneath the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of control .\nEventually , the cells create a bulge that protrudes abnormally into the artery .\nInflammation attacks this micro-fracture , causing rough and uneven surfaces .\nTo cover and repair the bumpy surface , fats and cholesterol stick to the arterial walls .\nFortunately , it \u2019 s easy to load up on foods rich in these B vitamins .\nThey include broccoli , Brussels sprouts , leafy green vegetables , such as cabbage , kale , and spinach , peas , beans , poultry , fish , eggs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplement , choose a liposomal one for better absorption .\nVitamin K2 is one nutrient that is difficult to get enough from your diet .\nSo you need to plan to take it .\nIt has the important job of helping to move calcium away from the blood vessels and kidneys to the bones and teeth where it is needed , by activating the hormone osteocalcin .\nThis helps prevent calcification in the coronary arteries .\nWhen your body has calcium floating around without a home , it becomes more likely that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplementing , choose the MK-7 form of K2 .\nThis is because it has a very long half-life in the body compared to other forms of vitamin K2 , which quickly disappear from circulation .\nThe recommended dosage is 100 to 200 mcg of MK-7 per day .\nMK-7 is often paired with vitamin D3 because they work together to move calcium .\nThere are only a few foods that are rich in vitamin K2 MK-7 .\nThese are fermented probiotic foods like natto , sauerkraut , kefir , and yogurt , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edam .\nNatto has the highest amounts of MK-7 but if you \u2019 re not Japanese , you may not like the taste .\nInstead , consider a Nattokinase supplement .\nThis enzyme extracted from Natto has the amazing ability to dissolve blood clots and reduce blood thickness , which prevents blood vessel blockages .\nWhen consuming vitamin K2 as food , include a mix of MK-4 .\nThese are goose liver and leg , pastured eggs , grass-fed butter , chicken liver and leg , eel , and salmon .\nBe aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitamin K2 , as do medications like statins .\nGetting into our Top 3 , Number 3 is \u201c Magnesium \u201d .\nAs many as 80 % of adults are deficient in magnesium because it \u2019 s depleted in the soil .\nThis is serious because your heart can not function properly without adequate magnesium .\nMagnesium prevents muscle spasms of the heart arteries , which increases the risk of high blood pressure and heart attack .\nTogether with vitamins K2 and D3 , magnesium stops calcium from forming inside the plaque .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure , reduces chest pain , and prevents abnormal blood clotting .\nTaking 800-1,000 mg of this supplement every day can help protect your heart and treat many heart conditions .\nIf you \u2019 re wondering which form of magnesium to take , the magnesium supplement I recommend contains all 7 forms .\nSee the link below .\nMagnesium-rich foods include dark leafy greens , seeds , beans , fish , whole grains , nuts , dark chocolate , yogurt , avocados , bananas , and more .\nMany experts agree that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2:1 .\nThe reality is the average person on a typical western diet has a 25:1 ratio , thanks to Omega-6 polyunsaturated fats in vegetable oils used for cooking and extending shelf life in packaged foods .\nThese oils and fats are oxidized when they are heated , dried , aged , exposed to light , and chemically processed , even BEFORE entering your blood vessels .\nThis is a pro-inflammatory state that gives rise to increased blood pressure , high blood sugar , excess body fat around the waist , and abnormal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions increase the risk of atherosclerosis .\nIncreasing omega-3 fatty acids in your diet helps reduce inflammation .\nFor supplementation , avoid cheap , big-box brand fish oil because they are likely to have oxidized and gone bad .\nGo with clean fish oil with high absorption , from a brand you can trust , or consider krill oil .\nExcellent food sources of heart-healthy Omega-3s are sardines , wild salmon , mackerel , walnuts , macadamia nuts , chia seeds , flaxseeds , seaweed , and algae ( spirulina and chlorella ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have \u201c Garlic , Cocoa , Beetroot \u201d .\nI have grouped these three foods because they work synergistically to increase nitric oxide levels and improve blood flow , which helps lower high blood pressure .\nNitrate-rich vegetables like spinach , arugula , and beetroot increase your blood levels of nitric oxide , which improves blood flow .\nCocoa helps maintain those high nitric oxide levels .\nGarlic enhances signaling for more nitric oxide production\u2013so you can get your heart pumping strong !\nTake these 3 foods daily as part of a heart-healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30-40 grams of dark chocolate with a 75 % cocoa content , and 3 to 6 cloves of garlic over several meals .\nGarlic , whether in its raw or aged form , protects your heart in FIVE other ways that are backed by studies : prevent coronary artery calcification , reduce arteriosclerotic plaque , increase HDL and decrease LDL , prevent blood clots , and reduce oxidation and inflammation in blood vessels .\nIf you dislike the smell of garlic , take an aged garlic extract supplement .\nThree other amazing foods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce inflammation and open your arteries are cayenne pepper , ginger , and pomegranate juice .\nSee our other videos .\nAs always , this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice ; we are not doctors .\nI hope you

can reduce the symptoms and heal your gut .\nNow , the symptoms of gut inflammation go beyond the bloating , gas , \u201c stuck poop \u201d , digestive discomfort , or irregular bowel movements you may have experienced .\nMillions of people suffer from autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes , Crohn \u2019 s , ulcerative colitis , rheumatoid arthritis , psoriasis , lupus , and multiple sclerosis .\nAll of these have a lot to do with gut inflammation .\nAn autoimmune disease happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body .\nDid you know , 80 % of your immune cells are in your gut ?\nWhen we talk about the gut , we \u2019 re really focused on the intestines-even though the gastrointestinal tract goes from the mouth all the way down to the rear .\nNow , because your gut is closely tied to your digestive , nervous , and immune systems , inflammation that goes on in your gut can affect your entire body , including your immune , brain , mental , and skin health , energy levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that \u2019 s why it \u2019 s important to reduce gut inflammation and keep your gut healthy .\nNow , the inflammation we \u2019 re talking about is NOT acute inflammation .\nAcute inflammation is when your body responds when you are injured , have an allergy , or get sick , and it goes away after you recover .\nLike when you fall off your bike and bruise your knee .\nOr when you have seasonal allergies and you start sneezing .\nThe inflammation that concerns us is chronic inflammation , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time and constantly reacts with inflammation .\nThis chronic inflammation is the root cause of many major chronic diseases , such as diabetes , obesity , and cardiovascular disease .\nSo , when we talk about gut inflammation , it means your intestines are inflamed all the time .\nSo , the next question is , how does gut inflammation come about ?\nThere are two ways that inflammation can happen in the gut .\nThe first way is when your microbiome gets out of balance .\nNow , your microbiome comprises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabit your gut .\nThese microbes are either helpful or harmful .\nWhen there are too few good guys , too many bad guys , or a mixture of both , an imbalance or \u201c dysbiosis \u201d happens .\nThe disease-causing bad guys are called pathogens and they form colonies called biofilms .\nNow , when your body lacks the good guys or probiotics , because of poor food choices , the pathogens overgrow and release inflammation-promoting substances .\nThese biofilms , also make it hard for your intestines to absorb vitamins and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , the second way that gut inflammation happens is when the epithelium or single layer of cells that make up your intestinal lining becomes permeable or \u201c leaky \u201d .\nWhen this happens , large molecules from the gastrointestinal tract enter your bloodstream .\nNow , this is NOT supposed to happen , so your immune system tags these molecules for destruction and sparks a chain reaction of inflammation .\nUsually , the permeability of your gut lining is controlled by \u201c tight junctions \u201d .\nThese are the seals between adjoining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , the job of the tight junctions is to allow beneficial nutrients to pass through and keep out larger inflammatory particles like pathogens , toxic chemicals , and undigested food .\nBut these tight junctions become porous when we do not eat enough foods to repair and strengthen the gut \u2019 s protective layer , such as bone broth and vitamin C-rich foods like citrus fruits and dark leafy greens that help build collagen .\nOr when we eat foods we \u2019 re sensitive to , and can not digest well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in biofilms cause the tight junctions to loosen up .\nNow that you know the two pathways for gut inflammation , let \u2019 s look at the symptoms of an inflamed gut .\nIf you have gut inflammation , your digestive function is weakened , and you will start experiencing both gut and non-gut symptoms .\nThe symptoms of gut inflammation may include : Skin issues such as dermatitis , psoriasis , or acne .\nAre you enjoying the information ?\nMake sure you like , share and subscribe and click on notifications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next , let \u2019 s look at the 5 worst food ingredients that cause inflammation in the gut and the rest of the body .\nWe begin with our Number 5 , \u201c Processed Sugar \u201d Processed sugar refers to refined sugar and carbs , and \u201c added sugar \u201d , like high fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) .\nAdded sugar , is sugar that \u2019 s been removed from its source , and added to foods and drinks as a sweetener , and to increase shelf life .\nProcessed sugars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called cytokines .\nWhen sugary and starchy foods make it to the intestines , they selectively feed the pathogens and starve the beneficial bacteria , which prefer low-sugar plant fibers .\nSugar also damages the protective intestinal barrier , especially when there is a lack of fiber to feed the probiotics .\nIn one study published in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases in 2016 , researchers followed over 360,000 participants from several European countries who ate a diet high in sugar and soft drinks .\nThe researchers found that this eating pattern increased the risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that eating a lot of vegetables helped reduce the risk of getting ulcerative colitis , even among people who ate a lot of sugar and soft drinks .\nAs you may already know , soft drinks use HFCS as a sweetener , as do a lot of seemingly \u201c healthy \u201d packaged foods like salad dressings , sweetened yogurt , and granola bars .\nHFCS is inflammatory , and over the last few decades , the overconsumption of HFCS has been linked to dramatic increases in inflammatory bowel disease , obesity , fatty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While processed sugars cause a cytokine storm , natural sugars in whole foods have NOT been linked to inflammation .\nSo , to keep gut inflammation in check , we must avoid or reduce processed sugar .\nThis includes : Foods with added sugars or fructose , including ice cream , chocolate bars , and sugar-sweetened drinks such as soda , fruit juice , and energy drinks .\nArtificial sweeteners with names like aspartame , sucralose , saccharin , and agave syrup .\nInstead , to sweeten your food and drinks , use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , let \u2019 s talk about the other type of sugar we need to cut back on : refined carbs .\nThese are refined grains that have been processed to the point that almost all the bran , fiber , and nutrients have been removed .\nThey break down easily into simple sugars and cause rapid spikes in blood sugar and insulin , which lead to weight gain , insulin resistance , and diabetes .\nThese inflammatory \u201c empty carbs \u201d are the comfort foods many of us crave , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pastries , white flour , white rice , sweet desserts , and breakfast cereals .\nSo instead of refined carbs , eat the following types of carbs to soothe inflammation in the gut .\nPrebiotics , or natural fibers that feed the good bacteria like dandelion greens , garlic , onions , chicory root , artichokes , bananas , whole oats , and apples .\nGluten-free whole grains like quinoa , buckwheat , millet , and wild and brown rice .\nThese complex carbs help your blood sugar rise more slowly .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ starchy vegetables like potatoes and legumes with lots of fiber .\nNext up , our Number 4 is \u201c Gluten \u201d .\nYou may want to consider eating less wheat , even if you do not carry the gene for celiac disease , are not gluten-sensitive , and do not have Inflammatory Bowel Disease .\nThis is because one fragment of gluten found in wheat , called gliadin , stimulates the release of the protein zonulin in the gut barrier .\nZonulin expands the tight junctions and increases the \u201c leakage \u201d of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating gluten can contribute to a continuous state of low-grade inflammation .\nA study published in the Scandinavian Journal of Gastroenterology in 2006 found that gluten increases intestinal permeability for everyone , but especially for celiac patients .\nCommon grains that contain gluten include wheat , rye , and barley .\nNext , we have Number 3 , \u201c Ultra Processed Foods \u201d .\nUltra-processed foods ( UPF ) are laden with more than just added salt and sugar .\nThey include artificial colors , hydrogenated fats , preservatives , and additives to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe Brazilian researchers who came up with this term defined UPF as \u201c industrial formulations with five or more ingredients.\n\u201d These highly-modified foods disrupt the gut microbiome and weaken the gut barrier .\nAccording to a study published in The BMJ , UPF makes up 58 % of the calories eaten in the U.S. and contributes almost 90 % of the energy from added sugars .\nStudies show that eating larger amounts of UPF significantly increases the risks of inflammatory bowel disease .\nAlso , processed meats have been associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they fuel gut inflammation .\nAvoid UPF and eat anti-inflammatory whole foods , including anti-bacterial foods like garlic and ginger , to promote good gut bacteria .\nClick the link below to get your free anti-inflammatory diet plan .\nThe next two ingredients are commonly found in UPF .\nAt Number 2 , we have \u201c Vegetable Oils \u201d .\nVegetable oils are also known as refined seed oils , which is a more accurate name for these industrial oils .\nThey are widely used for cooking in restaurants and for extending the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these processed oils include canola , corn , cottonseed , soybean , sunflower , safflower , grapeseed , and rice bran .\nNow , they \u2019 re really bad for your gut and clog up your arteries .\nThis is because they contain high levels of polyunsaturated Omega-6 fatty acids which are easily oxidized by heat and light , and form unnatural molecules .\nThese molecules irritate your gut lining and cause inflammation that leads to a leaky gut .\nThe problem is most people ingest far more Omega-6 than anti-inflammatory Omega-3 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ oils with healthy fats like avocado oil , macadamia oil , coconut oil , grass-fed butter , and extra virgin olive oil .\nAnd at Number 1 , we have \u201c Trans fats \u201d Artificial trans fats are another type of vegetable oil .\nThey are often listed as partially hydrogenated oils on food labels .\nThese are formed by adding hydrogen to vegetable oil , so the oil becomes solid at room temperature .\nEven though the FDA banned artificial trans fats in the U.S. in 2018 , they can still be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetable shortening which is used for making soft and flaky cakes and pastries , microwave popcorn , margarine , fried fast foods , and nondairy coffee creamers .\nYou \u2019 ll want to stay far away from these heart-disease-causing vegetable oils .\nSo , these are the top 5 worst foods that cause gut inflammation you \u2019 ll want to avoid .\nOther factors that increase harmful gut bacteria and inflammation include : Finally , if you \u2019 re looking for vitamins to heal a leaky gut , the best ones are zinc @ @

significantly increase HDL cholesterol , reduce inflammatory markers , lower blood pressure , and even help people who have suffered a heart attack avoid complications .\nWhile we can get CoQ10 from organ meats and grass-fed beef , the quantities are small , so it \u2019 s best to supplement .\nThis is especially true if you \u2019 re on statins as this medication depletes your body \u2019 s natural store of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 45 , consider taking 100 mg of a high-absorption CoQ10 daily , like Ubiquinol , to protect your heart .\nNext up , at Number 6 , we have \u201c Vitamin C \u201d .\nYou know vitamin C is vital for a strong immune system .\nBut did you know vitamin C also keeps your arteries strong , yet pliable , as they flex and contract with the pulsing of blood ?\nIt helps manufacture collagen\u2013the glue that holds your tissues together , and this includes your blood vessels .\nWhen there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear in the arteries and cholesterol enters these cracks .\nAs an antioxidant , vitamin C has been shown in one study to stop LDL from oxidizing by 64 % .\nTo get these cardioprotective benefits , eat vitamin C from whole foods , or get it from a whole foods supplement , and NOT synthetic ascorbic acid .\nFoods that are rich in vitamin C include bell peppers , broccoli , Brussels sprouts , and citrus fruits .\nComing up next , Number 5 is \u201c Vitamin B6 , B12 , folate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep your brain young and healthy .\nA deficiency can damage the endothelium through high levels of homocysteine in the blood .\nHomocysteine is an amino acid used by the body to build and sustain tissue .\nWhen you eat red meat and dairy products , the amino acid methionine converts to homocysteine .\nYour body needs vitamins B6 , B12 , and folate to use homocysteine properly .\nWhen levels of these B vitamins are low , homocysteine levels rise .\nThis causes the smooth muscle cells that lie just beneath the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of control .\nEventually , the cells create a bulge that protrudes abnormally into the artery .\nInflammation attacks this micro-fracture , causing rough and uneven surfaces .\nTo cover and repair the bumpy surface , fats and cholesterol stick to the arterial walls .\nFortunately , it \u2019 s easy to load up on foods rich in these B vitamins .\nThey include broccoli , Brussels sprouts , leafy green vegetables , such as cabbage , kale , and spinach , peas , beans , poultry , fish , eggs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplement , choose a liposomal one for better absorption .\nVitamin K2 is one nutrient that is difficult to get enough from your diet .\nSo you need to plan to take it .\nIt has the important job of helping to move calcium away from the blood vessels and kidneys to the bones and teeth where it is needed , by activating the hormone osteocalcin .\nThis helps prevent calcification in the coronary arteries .\nWhen your body has calcium floating around without a home , it becomes more likely that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplementing , choose the MK-7 form of K2 .\nThis is because it has a very long half-life in the body compared to other forms of vitamin K2 , which quickly disappear from circulation .\nThe recommended dosage is 100 to 200 mcg of MK-7 per day .\nMK-7 is often paired with vitamin D3 because they work together to move calcium .\nThere are only a few foods that are rich in vitamin K2 MK-7 .\nThese are fermented probiotic foods like natto , sauerkraut , kefir , and yogurt , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edam .\nNatto has the highest amounts of MK-7 but if you \u2019 re not Japanese , you may not like the taste .\nInstead , consider a Nattokinase supplement .\nThis enzyme extracted from Natto has the amazing ability to dissolve blood clots and reduce blood thickness , which prevents blood vessel blockages .\nWhen consuming vitamin K2 as food , include a mix of MK-4 .\nThese are goose liver and leg , pastured eggs , grass-fed butter , chicken liver and leg , eel , and salmon .\nBe aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitamin K2 , as do medications like statins .\nGetting into our Top 3 , Number 3 is \u201c Magnesium \u201d .\nAs many as 80 % of adults are deficient in magnesium because it \u2019 s depleted in the soil .\nThis is serious because your heart can not function properly without adequate magnesium .\nMagnesium prevents muscle spasms of the heart arteries , which increases the risk of high blood pressure and heart attack .\nTogether with vitamins K2 and D3 , magnesium stops calcium from forming inside the plaque .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure , reduces chest pain , and prevents abnormal blood clotting .\nTaking 800-1,000 mg of this supplement every day can help protect your heart and treat many heart conditions .\nIf you \u2019 re wondering which form of magnesium to take , the magnesium supplement I recommend contains all 7 forms .\nSee the link below .\nMagnesium-rich foods include dark leafy greens , seeds , beans , fish , whole grains , nuts , dark chocolate , yogurt , avocados , bananas , and more .\nMany experts agree that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2:1 .\nThe reality is the average person on a typical western diet has a 25:1 ratio , thanks to Omega-6 polyunsaturated fats in vegetable oils used for cooking and extending shelf life in packaged foods .\nThese oils and fats are oxidized when they are heated , dried , aged , exposed to light , and chemically processed , even BEFORE entering your blood vessels .\nThis is a pro-inflammatory state that gives rise to increased blood pressure , high blood sugar , excess body fat around the waist , and abnormal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions increase the risk of atherosclerosis .\nIncreasing omega-3 fatty acids in your diet helps reduce inflammation .\nFor supplementation , avoid cheap , big-box brand fish oil because they are likely to have oxidized and gone bad .\nGo with clean fish oil with high absorption , from a brand you can trust , or consider krill oil .\nExcellent food sources of heart-healthy Omega-3s are sardines , wild salmon , mackerel , walnuts , macadamia nuts , chia seeds , flaxseeds , seaweed , and algae ( spirulina and chlorella ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have \u201c Garlic , Cocoa , Beetroot \u201d .\nI have grouped these three foods because they work synergistically to increase nitric oxide levels and improve blood flow , which helps lower high blood pressure .\nNitrate-rich vegetables like spinach , arugula , and beetroot increase your blood levels of nitric oxide , which improves blood flow .\nCocoa helps maintain those high nitric oxide levels .\nGarlic enhances signaling for more nitric oxide production\u2013so you can get your heart pumping strong !\nTake these 3 foods daily as part of a heart-healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30-40 grams of dark chocolate with a 75 % cocoa content , and 3 to 6 cloves of garlic over several meals .\nGarlic , whether in its raw or aged form , protects your heart in FIVE other ways that are backed by studies : prevent coronary artery calcification , reduce arteriosclerotic plaque , increase HDL and decrease LDL , prevent blood clots , and reduce oxidation and inflammation in blood vessels .\nIf you dislike the smell of garlic , take an aged garlic extract supplement .\nThree other amazing foods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce inflammation and open your arteries are cayenne pepper , ginger , and pomegranate juice .\nSee our other videos .\nAs always , this

You May Be Ignoring", "content": "Does your heart regularly skip a beat ?\nDo your muscles cramp up often ?\nIs your thinking slower than it used to be ?\nIf any of these sounds like you , this could be because you have lower-than-normal levels of potassium in your body .\nThe medical name for this condition is hypokalemia .\nA full 98 % of the potassium in your body is found in your cells-and for good reason !\nPotassium is an electrolyte-this means it helps carry electrical signals to cells in your body .\nYour body uses this electricity to keep fluid balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscle cells , particularly the heart muscle cells .\nPotassium helps your heartbeat stay regular , your kidneys function properly and stop your sodium levels from spiking too high .\nPotassium deficiency is more common than you think .\nStudies show that 9 out of 10 Americans\u2014that \u2019 s upwards of 290 million people\u2014are only getting about half the 4.7 grams of this essential mineral they need each day .\nThe normal range for blood potassium is between 3.5 to 5.5 mmol/L .\nBelow this level , hypokalemia occurs .\nVery low levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 2.5 mmol/L ) can lead to irregular heart rhythms and trigger cardiac arrest\u2014which can be deadly .\nSo , what causes a potassium deficiency , and what are the symptoms that warn you of low potassium ?\nHow can you restore your potassium ?\nThis is exactly what we \u2019 ll talk about in the rest of this video .\nFirst , let \u2019 s look at what causes hypokalemia .\nA potassium deficiency is rarely caused by a low intake of fruits and vegetables alone .\nThe most common cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis happens in people who take prescription medications called diuretics or water pills , which make them urinate more often .\nThese medications are often prescribed for high blood pressure or heart disease .\nAnother reason is the excessive loss of potassium in your digestive tract .\nThis may be due to frequent vomiting , diarrhea , or laxative use .\nOther physical conditions that contribute to potassium loss include : Other medications such as insulin and antibiotics .\nLow magnesium levels .\nMagnesium actively transports potassium across your cells .\nSo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potassium levels suffer too .\nNext , what are the symptoms of hypokalemia ?\nOften , the symptoms of low potassium are easily overlooked , until they become serious .\nHigh blood pressure , or hypertension , can be caused by excess weight , genetics , or eating a lot of processed foods that are high in sodium .\nMaintaining healthy blood pressure requires the perfect balance of electrolytes .\nPotassium and sodium are electrolytes that work inversely in the body .\nWhen you eat potassium-rich foods , your kidneys get rid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells don \u2019 t have enough potassium , the kidneys reabsorb sodium back into the blood vessels , and your body holds on to more water .\nExtra water in your blood means there is extra pressure on your blood vessel walls , and this raises your blood pressure .\nPotassium helps to widen blood vessels and lower blood pressure .\nComing up next , Number 9 is \u201c Irregular Heartbeat \u201d .\nFor most people , heart palpitations or a skipped heartbeat now and then are not a big deal .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this can cause cardiac arrhythmias or an irregular heartbeat , especially for people who are at risk of heart disease .\nThis is because low potassium levels change the flow of potassium in and out of heart cells .\nAs a result , electrical signals that control your heartbeat don \u2019 t work properly , and your heart beats too fast , too slow , or irregularly .\nIf you notice any changes to your heart rate , seek medical attention right away .\nNext up , we have Number 8 .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you often experience painful cramps in your legs , a lack of potassium could be to blame .\nThis is because you lose electrolytes , including potassium , after an intense workout .\nPotassium is important for muscles because it helps relay signals from your brain to make them contract .\nIt also helps end these contractions by leaving the muscle cells .\nWhen blood potassium levels are low , your brain can not relay these signals as effectively .\nThis can be a problem for athletes because it can lead to reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracting .\nCramps are unlikely with mild or moderate hypokalemia , but they may occur if potassium levels drop below 2.5 mmol/L .\nIn rare cases , severe hypokalemia can also cause rhabdomyolysis in which muscle tissue breaks down quickly , often resulting in kidney damage .\nTherefore , it \u2019 s recommended to take electrolytes before , during , and after vigorous exercise .\nOur Number 7 is \u201c Weakness and Fatigue.\n\u201d A lack of potassium can lead to weakness and fatigue for two reasons .\nFirst , potassium helps regulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are low , your muscles produce weaker contractions .\nSecond , low potassium also causes your body to release less insulin .\nThis leads to high blood sugar levels , which means less sugar is converted by your cells into energy .\nMany factors can make you feel weak , which makes it hard to pinpoint low potassium as the cause .\nHowever , if you \u2019 re feeling exhausted after working out and getting enough sleep , low potassium levels might be the cause .\nLow levels of potassium can cause constipation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain to the muscles in your digestive tract so they can contract and propel food along .\nWhen potassium levels drop , the contractions become weaker and the churning of food slows down .\nIf potassium levels drop too low , the intestines may stop moving and this can cause nausea , vomiting , lack of appetite , bloating , and abdominal pain .\nAre you enjoying the information ?\nMake sure you like , share and subscribe and click on notifications so you never miss a video .\nNext on the list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d .\nLow potassium levels may prevent your kidneys from concentrating urine and keeping electrolyte levels balanced .\nThis can lead to excessive urination ( polyuria ) and excessive thirst ( polydipsia ) .\nExcessive urination may lead to lower potassium levels .\nSeek medical attention if your frequency of urination changes suddenly .\nNext up , Number 4 is \u201c Tingling and Numbness \u201d .\nLow potassium levels can weaken nerve signals and lead to tingling and numbness in the hands , arms , legs , and feet .\nThis condition is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an uncomfortable position , this may cause tingling and numbness\u2014and is no cause for concern .\nHowever , when these symptoms persist , it \u2019 s time to seek medical attention .\nGetting into our top 3 , Number 3 is \u201c Breathing Difficulties \u201d .\nIf your blood potassium levels are severely low , it can cause shortness of breath by restricting the expansion and contraction of your lungs .\nThis is because potassium is vital for sending the right signals to the lungs so they know when to contract and expand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low blood potassium levels or high blood potassium levels ( hyperkalemia ) were at a much higher risk of respiratory failure and needing a ventilator in the hospital , compared to people who had healthy potassium levels .\nAs mentioned earlier , low potassium levels can cause an irregular heartbeat because of faulty electrical signals in the lower heart chambers .\nAs a result , the heart can not pump enough blood to the rest of the body .\nLess blood means less oxygen delivered and this may cause shortness of breath .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ neurons in your brain can not fire electrical signals rapidly .\nThis results in confusion , forgetfulness , and difficulty concentrating .\nA lack of potassium can reduce blood circulation and disrupt hormone production .\nThis includes the mood-regulating hormone , serotonin .\nA potassium deficiency may manifest through severe changes in mood and behavior , such as increased depression , anxiety , or irritability .\nOne study published in the British Journal of Nutrition found that people who ate a low-sodium , high-potassium diet enjoyed reduced stress and depression while also having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have \u201c Kidney Stones \u201d .\nIt is estimated that over 1 in 10 people will have a kidney stone in their lives .\nIf you develop kidney stones , they may be a sign of low potassium .\nIn one study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1993 , men who took in less than 2.9 grams of potassium daily were twice as likely to develop kidney stones as those who took in over 4 grams of potassium daily .\nKidney stones are hard masses of minerals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your kidneys .\nThese small stones are most commonly made up of calcium and oxalate .\nWhen these stones become lodged in the urinary tract and block the flow of urine , they can cause excruciating pain .\nPotassium helps your kidneys flush excess calcium through your urine .\nIf you don \u2019 t get enough potassium in your diet , this can cause the masses to form .\nNext , how do you get more potassium ?\nThe best way to replenish potassium is to add fruits and vegetables to each meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are plenty of other foods that contain potassium .\nYou can find it in whole foods like leafy greens , tomatoes , cucumbers , zucchini , eggplant , avocado , pumpkins , potatoes , carrots , raisins , beans , dairy products like milk and yogurt , meat , poultry , fish , and nuts .\nYour doctor may prescribe supplements if you have a medical condition or are taking specific medications .\nIf your case is more severe , your doctor may give you potassium intravenously .\nIf you decide to supplement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your doctor first
