Uses Religious Test Against Service Members To Enforce Vaccine Mandate", "content": "Members of our military pledge their loyalty to the Constitution .\nIts First Amendment guarantees freedom of religion .\nSo , it would be perverse to force men and women in uniform to abandon their deeply held religious beliefs to serve their country .\nYet that \u2019 s what \u2019 s happening regarding the COVID-19 vaccine mandates \u2014 for which the normal rules seem not to apply .\nThe Air Force recently discharged its first active-duty members for declining to take a COVID-19 vaccine .\nThose 27 are likely the first batch of many to be discharged on these grounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have requested religious exemptions .\nSo far , not one has been granted .\nLast September , an Air Force Academy graduate requested a religious exemption .\nAs a Catholic , she objected to benefitting from vaccines developed or tested on cell lines derived from a procured abortion .\nThe reviewing chaplain denied her request .\nWhat \u2019 s troubling is that he did so on theological grounds .\nIf this case were unique , we might not worry much about it .\nBut this is just one example of many .\nNot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 vaccines .\nEven Catholic bishops do not agree on the matter .\nSome have called for ethical alternatives .\nOthers have urged Catholics to get a vaccine .\nBut it \u2019 s not hard to construct a coherent objection to the drugs in question .\nHere goes .\nAbortion is wrong .\nBenefitting from an abortion is wrong .\nAll currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines were developed with or tested on fetal cell lines harvested from an abortion .\nTo receive one of these vaccines is to benefit from an abortion .\nConclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should avoid any of these vaccines .\nThis is not a complex argument .\nYes , well-meaning people may dispute some or another premise .\nSo what ?\nThe point is that one could sincerely and rationally believe this argument , and so have a moral objection to the vaccines .\nIn many cases , this is also a religious objection .\nA Catholic might believe that her faith teaches that procuring or actively securing a benefit from abortion is wrong .\nMany men and women in uniform believe this .\nAs a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the military is executing it , threatens their religious conscience .\nTake the case of the Air Force grad rebuffed in September .\nThe chaplain reviewing her request claimed her objection wasn \u2019 t a \u201c sincerely held belief.\n\u201d Why ?\nBecause she conceded that she took other drugs , such as Tylenol , which he claimed had also been \u201c tested \u201d on such cell lines .\nShe asked for the document backing up his claim on vaccine testing , and was sent a blog post written by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this priest had found that many common drugs such as Tylenol had at some point been \u201c tested \u201d on the same fetal cell lines in question .\nHis argument was that one could not consistently take any of these drugs while refusing to take the authorized COVID vaccines .\nThere are two huge problems with the chaplain \u2019 s response .\nFirst , it contradicts the law .\nBelievers don \u2019 t forfeit their religious rights either because their observance is sloppy or they \u2019 ve never openly demonstrated such beliefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priest was describing drugs that had been on the market for decades before the fetal cell lines even existed .\nHe had equated such unrelated experiments with tests for COVID vaccines conducted by and for drug companies to get the drugs approved in the first place .\nThe Air Force chaplain simply parroted this claim in rejecting the airman \u2019 s request for an exemption .\nBut this is to compare apples with albatrosses \u2014 which is why this priest \u2019 s blog post was eviscerated by critics .\nIf you take Tylenol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are not benefiting in any way from an experiment done with it for some unknown reason by a grad student in 2010 .\nNot so with this current batch of COVID-19 vaccines .\nThe development and testing on fetal cell lines were necessary conditions for these drugs to be authorized .\n( There are other drugs in the pipeline that are not entangled with fetal cell lines , but none are yet available . )\nNow one could argue that benefitting from an abortion isn \u2019 t the same as procuring an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance , follows Catholic teaching in forbidding all abortion .\nBut it lists ( strict ) criteria under which one could use a vaccine produced with \u201c illicit material \u201d without sin .\nBut whatever your view , this is clearly an ethical and theological dispute .\nThe military is denying requests for religious exemptions because ill-informed officials disagree with the theological views of service members under their command .\nThis seems to be military policy across the board .\nFox News reported on a leaked Coast Guard memo that advises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requests for religious exemption .\nThey are told to ask guardsmen about other drugs they take , and how other members of their religion , and religious leaders , view the vaccines .\nThe memo looks designed to bewilder coastguardsmen who lack graduate degrees in ethics .\nIn November , First Liberty filed a federal lawsuit against the administration on behalf of dozens of Navy SEALS and other Naval Special Warfare personnel .\nThe complaint contends that the mandate \u201c substantially burdens the SEALs \u2019 free exercise of religion , and the Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a compelling government interest , or that there are no less restrictive ways to further its effort to mitigate the Covid-19 virus.\n\u201d In another case , Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Samuel Alito this week issued a dissenting opinion citing the court \u2019 s previous judgment that \u201c under the Free Exercise Clause , government \u2018 can not act in a manner that passes judgment upon or presupposes the illegitimacy of religious beliefs and practices.\n\u2019 \u201d They continue : \u201c As a result , we have argued that government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set aside \u2019 if there is even \u2018 slight suspicion \u2019 that those actions \u2018 stem from animosity to religion or distrust of its practices.\n\u2019 \u201d Will that reasoning prevail in court when it comes to military service ?\nWho knows ?\nBut even if the courts decide that the commander in chief can legally force those in uniform to surrender their religious conscience , should he do so ?\nThis is a moral question before it is a legal one .\nShould President Biden expect the military to protect his religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act to protect their own ?", "author": "Jay W.

they grab power , they are very reluctant to give it back .\nBut our would-be overlords have one big problem .\nThe pandemic that they argued justified restrictions on individual liberty will eventually ebb .\nSo , the search has been on for the next great excuse to limit liberty .\nIt is increasingly clear that the \u201c climate crisis \u201d will fill that role .\nThe beauty part\u2014from the points of view of these want-to-be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by which I mean , the purported emergency will not fade any time soon no matter what policies are enacted .\nIf the power granted to public health authorities during COVID is also ceded to climate change warriors , it would become an authoritarianism without a foreseeable end .\nAn explicit argument toward pursuing that objective was just published in the American Political Science Review , one of the world \u2019 s most elite and influential professional journals .\nThe author of \u201c Political Legitimacy , Authoritarianism , and Climate Change \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtailed because we have refused to do what the experts told us !\n\u201c Democratic publics have , on multiple occasions , defeated ( via

campaigns virtually impossible.\n\u201d Not only that , but the primacy of individual autonomy has at times rendered even minor interventions , ( e.g .\naround light bulbs , fuel efficiency standards , or diets ) extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like population control ) , unthinkable.\n\u201d How hard it is to be an autocrat !\nTo maintain \u201c foundational legitimacy \u201d ( FL ) \u201c authoritarian climate governance \u201d may have to be imposed .\nWhat you ask , is foundational legitimacy ?\n\u201c Crudely put , FL requires that citizens \u2019 essential safety needs are met.\n\u201d Moreover , foundational legitimacy takes priority over \u201c contingent legitimacy \u201d ( CL ) \u2014say , a belief in limited government\u2014because \u201c ensuring safety and security may , at times , justify relaxing or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or individual rights.\n\u201d Needless to say , the author claims that \u201c unfolding climate catastrophes \u201d have created such an acute state of peril that\u2014unless we voluntarily do what the climate autocrats tell us\u2014world leaders will have no choice but to wield the dictator \u2019 s stick .\nThe author helpfully provides specific examples of the despotic policies authoritarian climate governance could impose : \u2022 \u201c Governments might impel citizens to make significant lifestyle changes .\nOne pertinent example concerns curbing meat-heavy diets\u2026given the enormous carbon footprint of animal agriculture.\n\u201d \u2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proliferation of climate denialism or disinformation in public media .\nThis may well conflict with standard conceptions of freedom of expression or of the press .\nAgain , however , to the extent those freedoms have been exercised in ways that have undermined ( and continue to undermine ) effective climate action.\n\u201d \u2022 \u201c Relaxing property rights in order to nationalize , shutter , or repurpose certain companies , particularly in the energy and agriculture sectors , so as to ensure that the transition away from carbon-intensive production happens rapidly , fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Governments might also justifiably limit certain democratic institutions and processes to the extent these bear on the promulgation or implementation of environmental policy .\nThis could involve imposing a climate litmus-test on those who seek public office , disqualifying anyone who has significant ( relational or financial ) ties to climate-harming industries or a history of climate denialism.\n\u201d \u2022 \u201c More strongly , governments may establish institutions capable of overturning previous democratic decisions ( expressed , for example , in popular referenda or plebiscites ) against the implementation of carbon taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the people don \u2019 t want these policies ?\n\u201c If such restrictions are necessary for preserving FL , then they may be justifiably imposed , even if doing so cuts against the wishes of democratic publics or violates individual or group-based rights until the ( credible threat of ) emergency has passed.\n\u201d Some readers may be thinking : \u201c So , one egghead writing in a high brow journal has delusions of grandeur .\nIt will never happen.\n\u201d Don \u2019 t be so sure .\nThe fact that such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world \u2019 s most important political science publications\u2014and passed peer review !\n\u2014means that the ideas expressed therein are deemed legitimate and respectable among political scientists and the ruling elite .\nMoreover , this article is hardly a one-off .\nSuch argumentation is becoming a pattern among international intellectuals and globalist leaders .\nFor example , the Secretary-General of the United Nations , Ant\u00f3nio Guterres , argued in an official U.N. report that the world should adopt\u2014and the U.N. administer\u2014global speech codes to \u201c better regulate , and manage our digital commons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anthony Fauci has argued that the U.N. should \u201c rebuild the infrastructure of human existence.\n\u201d Prominent medical journals have called for declaring climate change a public health emergency so that COVID-type restrictions can be imposed .\nAn advocacy column in the prestigious science journal Nature even proposed imposing \u201c personal carbon allowances \u201d that would ration emissions as the private purchase of gasoline was restricted during World War II\u2014a policy that would be enforced through intrusive high-tech techniques of the kind currently imposed by the Chinese Communist Party \u2019 s odious social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear too much about this bubbling cauldron of despotism in the mainstream media .\nPart of the reason , I think , is that many of these articles are written by academics and policy apparatchiks that most people have never heard of , in the dry prose of academic discourse that lulls readers to sleep .\nPlus , media-dominant leftwing journalists \u2019 may be sympathetic to the cause believing that climate activists are on the right side of history and the world is imperiled by \u201c climate deniers.\n\u201d And we can never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the mainstream press .\nI mean , imagine if someone in the Donald Trump orbit\u2014say , Don , Jr. or Steve Bannon\u2014advocated revoking democratically enacted laws by fiat to serve a higher purpose .\nThe screaming in the press would never stop .\nBut when the head of the UN , Dr. Fauci , and influential academics\u2014people who have far more power than either Junior or Bannon\u2014propose worse anti-liberty prescriptions in the world \u2019 s most prestigious journals , all we hear is the sound of silence .\nAttention must be paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not funded , nor is it published , merely as a novel means of debating about so many angels and pins .\nThey have a deeply practical purpose : to influence the thinking of the politically powerful and move these ideas from proposed , into enacted , public policy .\nWe can \u2019 t let such undemocratic advocacy lurk in the shadows .\nPersonal liberty is too important to be left to the \u201c experts.\n\u201d The best way to prevent \u201c climate authoritarian governance \u201d is to expose advocates \u2019 repressive ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And here \u2019 s the good news .\nThere remains one huge obstacle

Almighty was calling on America to rise up and fulfill its spiritual destiny .\nTo the self-evident truth of all people having equal value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that people \u201c should not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.\n\u201d MLK \u2019 s message took root because it was grounded in unassailable truth , establishing an ideal and absolute standard for an interracial society not only in America but for the entire world .\nWere it possible to transport King into the present , he would be deeply troubled by today \u2019 s identity politics , hatred , intolerance , and division .\nKing would condemn critical race theory ( CRT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training perpetuates negative racial stereotypes , albeit in a reversal that denigrates the white race .\nHe would also find CRT fundamentally flawed because it exacerbates division in society rather than bringing people together and finding common ground through constructive dialogue and seeing all people as individuals made in God \u2019 s image .\nIt \u2019 s sad , but true , that many of the proponents of CRT want to censor MLK , just as they have done with cancellation and tearing down statues of other earlier American heroes .\nKing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights leader .\nHe had a deep mind of discernment that focused on timeless truths , many of which speak to us today , such as the Apostle Paul \u2019 s letter to the Romans , in which he said , \u201c Do not conform to the pattern of the world , but be transformed in the renewing of your mind.\n\u201d King drew on Thomas Jefferson \u2019 s statement , \u201c I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as 1954 , also recorded in his book \u201c Strength to Love , \u201d that \u201c if Americans permit thought-control , business-control , and freedom-control to continue , we shall surely move within the shadows of fascism.\n\u201d Today\u2014nearly 70 years later\u2014we have moved way beyond shadows and now live in a matrix of fascism and communism that effectively operates at various levels within the United States under the camouflage and misnomer of being \u201c woke.\n\u201d There have been few American leaders as strong and clearheaded about the dangers of groupthink than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waldo Emerson \u2019 s words , \u201c Whoso would be a man must be a non-conformist.\n\u201d And drawing on the Apostle Paul \u2019 s teachings , King implored that \u201c any Christian who blindly accepts the opinions of the majority and in fear and timidity follows a path of expediency and social approval is a mental and spiritual slave.\n\u201d But he also saw the positive side of those who went against the crowd , pointing out that \u201c the trailblazers in human , academic , scientific , and religious freedom have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any cause that concerns the progress of mankind , put your faith in the nonconformist !\n\u201d That so many brilliant nonconformists are being censored , canceled , and deplatformed today in America provides the clearest sign of regression and loss of the most essential freedom in America .\nOne is reminded of Ben Franklin \u2019 s admonition that \u201c there is no such thing as public liberty without free speech.\n\u201d King \u2019 s lesser-known speeches and sermons provide prescient insight for the times in which we live .\nOn numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to be \u201c wise as serpents , and harmless as doves , \u201d arguing that people need to have a tough mind and a tender heart .\nHe expressed concern that the \u201c prevalent tendency toward softmindedness is found in man \u2019 s unbelievable gullibility.\n\u201d He further stated that few people have the toughness of mind to judge critically and to discern the truth from the false , the fact from the fiction.\n\u201d King was extremely critical of the media , stating that \u201c one of the great needs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morass of false propaganda.\n\u201d He concluded this theme , with the warning that \u201c a nation or a civilization that continues to produce soft-minded men purchases its own spiritual death on the installment plan.\n\u201d Such counsel is dramatically more pertinent today than it was when he said it some 60 years ago .\nIf King were resurrected today , he would be shocked by the reversion that has taken place in America in the nearly three generations since he led the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s .\nHe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics , just as he would find the wholesale desensitization and detachment of young people troubling .\nHe would also reject the eclipse of group , gender , and ethnic identity paradigm over the merit and character of the individual as the primary criteria for evaluation , acceptance , and advancement\u2014whether in school admission or in the workplace .\nClearly , there is much to learn from and reflect on in King \u2019 s life .\nIn closing , what is most significant and formidable about the man was the unique , vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unfinished progress of America .\nIn spite of his flaws , he rose to the occasion of fulfilling the course of redemption in American history .\nNearly 200 years after the vision expressed in the Declaration of Independence , and nearly 100 years after the bloody Civil War and Lincoln

.\nClosed schools , remote instruction , and reduced school hours have made the loss inevitable for most .\nThe exceptions are students who received supplemental learning support beyond what their public schools provided \u2013 whether from parents , grandparents , older siblings , tutors , learning centers , or online resources .\nNorthwest Evaluation Association ( NWEA ) , a research-based nonprofit that assesses student progress and proficiency , recently released a report on learning during COVID-19 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ school year with a 9- to 11-percentile-point decline in math and a 3- to 7-percentile-point decline in reading .\nThe learning loss was greater among Hispanic , American Indian , and black students than among Asian and white students .\nAdditionally , high-poverty students had greater than average learning loss .\nThe learning loss leads to substantial economic effects .\nAccording to an analysis from Dan Goldhaber , Thomas Kane , and Andrew McEachin , the deficit represents $ 43,800 in lifetime earnings per student .\nMultiply that by the 50 million students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the figure is staggering : $ 2 trillion .\nClearly , the impact is not only hurting our students today but will also be carried with them into their adult years .\nGoldhaber , Kane , and McEachin provide additional insights regarding how long it will take for students to recover .\nFor example , they noted that in grades four and five , it would take \u201c an additional eight to 10 weeks of instruction to cover the loss in reading and math , respectively .\nIn grades 6 through 8 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students \u2019 rate of progress slows , it would take an additional 14 and 19 weeks of instruction to cover those losses in reading and math , respectively.\n\u201d Parents want this learning loss remedied .\nAt-home remote learning not only revealed to them how inefficient the education system was but also demonstrated the vastly differing learning needs among students .\nConsequently , parents are no longer satisfied with the ineffective one-size-fits-all approach \u2013 95 percent of parents support tailored instruction as the key to recovering student learning loss and improving K-12 education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniquely wired , with differing strengths and interests .\nIt \u2019 s illogical to conclude that all children will learn in the same way and at the same rate \u2013 but that \u2019 s how our current system operates .\nThis leads to a pivotal question : What stands in the way of personalizing education ?\nWith $ 800 billion annually devoted to K-12 public education ( expanded by an additional nearly $ 200 billion of federal funding during the pandemic ) , the problem is clearly not lack of money .\nNor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as virtually every student now has an Internet-connected device during the school day .\nUltimately , what stands in the way is a stagnant system , with its dearth of leadership and innovation and its entrenched

place in 2022 \u2014 50 years from when it was filmed .\nNow that 2022 has actually arrived , I decided to view the film again to check how well the writers did at predicting the world of today .\nUnsurprisingly , the movie got several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kyle Smith recently pointed out in a tongue-firmly-in-cheek takedown of contemporary liberal-hysteria culture .\nOn a more macro level , the film also completely missed feminism , one of the most powerful social revolutions in history .\nIn its dystopia , no women are in positions of power , and the main female characters are high-priced courtesans , known by the truly objectifying term \u201c furniture.\n\u201d The tech revolution was also absent .\nThere are no computers or cellphones in Soylent Green \u2019 s 2022 .\nAnd , as Kyle

and most people are reduced to eating synthetic food chips .\nStill , considering that the film was projecting forward five decades , Soylent Green was remarkably prescient .\nHere \u2019 s a list of plot devices that I thought were too dark to ever come true when I first saw the movie , but which \u2014 very roughly \u2014 have become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about before its time !\nThe film \u2019 s opening montage consists of a series of images depicting mass industrialization over time , complete with polluted rivers , belching smokestacks , and jammed highways .\nWe are told that the \u201c greenhouse effect \u201d caused catastrophic planetary warming , resulting in collapsing food production and other assorted miseries .\nFrankly , if I hadn \u2019 t known when the movie was made , I might have mistaken these introductory images for an Al Gore\u2013produced advocacy clip .\nWhatever one thinks of anthropogenic climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most important controversies of the contemporary moment .\nProfound income inequality .\nThe movie depicts a society riven by stark income inequality .\nThere are either the very rich , the poor , or the destitute .\nThe middle class seems to have disappeared .\nWhile the fictional disparity is well beyond anything seen in the actual 2022 United States , its disturbing vision of a society in which some live in secure splendor behind high walls , while others live in increasing chaos , is gut-wrenchingly recognizable .\nRolling blackouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systemically caused power blackouts .\nOur NYC doesn \u2019 t .\nBut California today does .\nEach year , power is turned off to millions of customers because of the fire hazard presented by shoddily maintained electrical equipment and overreliance on green energy

respectful cremations , cadavers are removed by garbage trucks and brought to mass-disposal centers to be dumped into what looks like sewage-processing plants ( where unknown to the populace , they are formulated into a food staple called soylent green ) .\nWe are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor are our bodies treated so disrespectfully .\nBut some people are choosing to have their bodies liquified after death so they can be poured down the sewer or composted to be used as fertilizer .\nThese new \u201c green \u201d methods of disposition are not metaphysically neutral , and , in my view , reflect a growing disdain for the inherent importance of human life that was magnified and bore such bitter fruit in Soylent Green .\nPeople living in the streets .\nSG-NYC is so overpopulated that masses of

shanty towns .\nThat such a human catastrophe would become a reality in the United States was utterly unthinkable in 1973 .\nEuthanasia .\nWhen the character Sol \u2014 played by Edward @ @ @ @ @ @ @

"date": "2022-01-19", "source": "discoveryinstitute", "title": "Critical Race Theory: Intriguing, But Wrong for K-12 Education", "content": "Critical Race Theory ( CRT ) , a relatively young legal theory that has been circulating in legal academic circles since the 1980s , suddenly burst on the scene of public consciousness in the past year .\nIt continues to be a topic of controversy due to its being advocated for inclusion in K-12 instruction .\nAs with other subjects that become political footballs , CRT elicits very strong views \u2014 especially among those with minimal understanding of the theory .\nUnless a person has taken the time to earnestly read source materials from CRT \u2019 s original authors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into one camp or the other \u2014 while still remaining in the dark about its meaning .\nHere I would like to provide some insights about CRT and encourage reading original source materials by authors such as Derrick Bell , Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw , and Richard Delgado .\nA great start would be Critical Race Theory : The Key Writings that Formed the Movement by Crenshaw , et al .\nWhat you will find is that CRT writings are not light reading by any means , but scholarly and heavily academic , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academics .\nYet grappling with these works is a necessary investment if you truly want to have an informed perspective regarding CRT .\nYou will likely come away with a conclusion that what has been labeled and promoted as \u201c CRT \u201d in K-12 education has virtually nothing to do with the theory as put forward in the key writings of its authors .\nLast year we heard the continual refrain , even from the highest levels of government , that CRT is needed for K-12 students because it teaches about slavery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this assertion is CRT is not something you would look for in a history book because it is not an account of specific events of the dark history of slavery and Jim Crow in America .\nRather , CRT is based on legal theory from the perspective of the role of law in the treatment of people of color .\nSpecifically , CRT examines how the law , since the founding of the country , has been both central and complicit in upholding white supremacy throughout its history in terms of social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nCRT is a movement of admitted far-left scholars who wish to challenge power structures represented in the American legal culture and society with respect to \u201c the rule of law \u201d and \u201c equal protection.\n\u201d Their belief is that whereas our laws are ostensibly \u201c neutral \u201d and \u201c objective , \u201d they are neither \u2014 and never could have been objective in the first place because of the racial dynamic that has been exercised legally and ideologically over the course of American history .\nThus , they call for \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and racism , which they believe was essentially discarded when the ideas of integration , assimilation , and color-blindness became the official norms .\nWhile these ideas are not necessarily bad things in and of themselves , CRT theorists believe current laws continue to promote racial domination and subjugation of people of color in both a systemic and institutional manner , and that legal remediation for past injustices is warranted .\nIt is not my intent to elucidate the details of CRT here ( which I will in the future as it deserves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that what most think is CRT is not CRT .\nIt is my belief those who oppose CRT in the classroom are correct that what is being called CRT should not be taught in K-12 instruction .\nWhat must be understood is that CRT has its roots in Critical Theory ( CT ) , which is the original thought of Marxist intellectual Antonio Gramsci , who argued that societies generally consist of two classes : oppressors and the oppressed , which could be applied not only to economic classes but also those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to race in America , examines the power dynamics of oppressors ( whites ) and the groups they have oppressed since the founding of this country ( blacks and other people of color ) .\nAccordingly , this set of values of the dominant oppressor class must be overcome and exchanged for a new system of values that empowers marginalized groups .\nCRT , I believe , is being specifically promoted in K-12 curriculums to layer on top of CT to form an outright Marxist approach , which seeks to transform and undermine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have opposed what they see as far-left Marxist indoctrination being pushed down from the academy and legal profession onto young impressionable minds still in the process of formation .\nCT offers a cynical critique of the American system of government that fails to account for racial progress and cooperation among both whites and people of color who have worked to build a more inclusive future for our country .\nThe last thing children need is to be told they and their classmates are either oppressors or oppressed based simply on the color of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taught the full truth of our history , including the many times we have failed to live up to our ideals .\nBut that is not the project of CRT , which due to its nuances and complexity as a recent and decidedly immature race-based legal theory , is highly inappropriate for K-12 students .\nIn short , the theory has limited pedagogic value and is enormously difficult to understand ( let alone teach ) by instructors not versed in legal theory and civil rights legislation .", "author": "Walter Myers III", "url":

mandate .\nHe embraced the radical idea of allowing parents to decide if their children mask up in the classroom , effective Jan. 24 .\nAddressing a joint assembly of Virginia lawmakers Monday , Youngkin noted there are 1.6 million unvaccinated Virginians and declared that speaking as governor , \u201c I \u2019 ll never tell you what you must do .\nBut speaking to you as a friend @ @ @ @ @ @

cybersecurity professional who , according to ALXnow , got a medical mask exemption for his children , rattled off the many other anti-COVID-19 measures the school district employs , including daily temperature checks , seating children three feet apart and a requirement that parents answer a Daily Symptom Checklist .\nMasks , he argued , do not enable \u201c a great learning environment \u201d and impede children \u2019 s social development and achievement .\n\u201c For anyone to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s not normal , \u201d Boyle noted .\nAs David Leonhardt of The New York Times has noted , the last two years entailed a \u201c trade-off \u201d in which officials tried \u201c to minimize the spread of Covid \u2014 a worthy goal absent other factors \u2014 rather than minimizing the damage that Covid does to society .\nThey have accepted more harm to children in exchange for less harm to adults , often without acknowledging the dilemma or assessing which decisions lead to less overall harm.\n\u201d The left \u2019 s reaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , well , not pro-parent or pro-choice .\nUsing her personal Twitter account as an Arlington , Virginia , parent , White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki thanked the district , which has announced it will continue to require masks , \u201c for standing up for our kids , teachers and administrators and their safety in the midst of a transmissible variant.\n\u201d Sen. Louise Lucas , the top Democrat in the state Senate , tweeted , \u201c Cry harder @ GovernorVA !\nYour executive orders do not change LAWS we passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we elect Governors not dictators.\n\u201d She was referring to SB1303 , a law signed last year by former Gov .\nRalph Northam , which requires schools to adhere to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines .\nGOP Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant , a sponsor of SB1303 , countered that the measure \u201c does not mandate the use of masks in school because the CDC does not mandate masks.\n\u201d A practicing physician , Dunnavant added in a statement , \u201c Today , we know that the risk of hospitalization for children is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia \u2019 s estimated almost 1.9 million children , .07 % have been hospitalized with Covid-19 since March 2020 .\nAt the same time , the use of masks in school presents risks of learning loss , social emotional challenges , and other issues .\nParents , constitutionally and logically , are the best people to do an analysis of what \u2019 s best for their child.\n\u201d If masks were a magic wand that prevented children from infection , pro-mask parents should feel secure that their children are protected by mask wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to force others to comply .\nBut masks aren \u2019 t a magic wand ; they \u2019 re a tool in a large tool kit that works best when employed universally , but at a cost .\nIt \u2019 s a cost many parents find unsustainable .\nAnother tool is listening .\nYoungkin \u2019 s response to Arlington \u2019 s decision to mandate student mask wearing \u2014 \u201c what that tells me is , they haven \u2019 t listened to parents yet , \u201d he told WTOP .\nSavvy school officials should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on both sides of the mask divide .\nAs Youngkin \u2019 s victory has made clear , making parents adhere to rules they believe are harmful to their children \u2019 s health won \u2019 t work anymore .\nBoyle is hardly the only parent who wants a return to normal .\nShame on elected officials who want to slam the door on their legitimate concerns .", "author": "Debra J.

to criminal justice .\nBut leftists are not giving up without a fight .\nAcross the nation , the rotten fruits of leftist politics have become all too obvious , as the defund-the-police mentality has left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are not held accountable for their crime sprees .\nThe predictable result has been skyrocketing thefts , assaults , shootings , and murders .\nBut people are finally getting fed up , and we \u2019 re beginning to see a change in both the political rhetoric and election of candidates promising to fix the problem .\nJust a year ago , San Francisco Mayor London Breed was one of the leading champions of slashing police budgets .\nBut in December , she changed her tune when she made an emergency request for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaring , \u201c It \u2019 s time for the reign of criminals to end.\n\u201d In New York City , former police officer Eric Adams was sworn into office as the new mayor after a campaign emphasizing law and order .\nOne of his campaign promises was to bring back a plainclothes police unit to tackle gang and gun violence , a promise that is now becoming reality .\nBut the mayors of both these cities face opposition from the very people who should be enforcing their tough-on-crime policies .\nIn San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his crackdown on crime .\nDespite the 161 percent increase in violence between 2020 and 2021 in the low-income , historically black Tenderloin neighborhood , Boudin insisted that jail and prosecution are not the proper solutions .\nIn New York City , the new Manhattan district attorney , Alvin Bragg , has

\u201c less serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routes per Bragg \u2019 s policy .\nIn Seattle , the story is a little different .\nIn what would have been a surprising development in other times , the liberal

pigs , \u201d and \u201c losers.\n\u201d In addition to record-breaking gun violence in the city , Davison also faces a backlog of nearly 4,000 criminal cases that accrued under the former city @ @ @

Catholic health companies big and small will join to protect the right of Catholics to participate in the healthcare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ?\nMedical conscience\u2014that is , the right of medical professionals and healthcare institutions to refuse to provide procedures , such as abortion , that violate their religious or moral beliefs\u2014has been under mounting pressure for more than a decade .\nBut there are strong indications that the Biden administration intends to attack medical conscience rights energetically in the coming months .\nA document recently came to light in a federal lawsuit that implies the Department of Health and Human Services will soon promulgate a rule requiring all medical institutions , organizations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or provide access to abortion , transgender transition procedures , and other interventions that are legal but that violate Catholic moral teaching .\nThis would not be the first time the government used the administrative state to attack medical conscience rights in healthcare .\nFor example , the Obama administration previously required employers to provide free access to contraception under the Affordable Care Act .\nBut it also allowed a narrow religious exemption , which became the subject of years of litigation and Supreme Court cases under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2020 , but that policy was enjoined by a court at the request of progressive activist groups such as Planned Parenthood , the Human Rights Campaign , and the Southern Poverty Law Center .\nWhen the Biden administration took office , it asked for a stay of the litigation until it could promulgate a new rule .\nWhen that did not happen in a timely manner , the anti-Trump rule plaintiffs sought to restart the litigation , and the Biden administration all but promised to promulgate a rule very much to the plaintiffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from an advocacy group that , if followed , would amount to a dream list of policies desired by secularist cultural warriors .\nOnly this time , the policy would apply universally\u2014without any religious exemptions or opt-outs allowed .\nMoreover , the expected rule would allow patients denied required coverage or procedures to file private discrimination lawsuits , even if the refusals were for religious reasons .\nThis could mean that employers would be legally required to cover abortion in health insurance , Catholic hospitals would be required to sterilize patients , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in transgender transition procedures\u2014among other coercive potentialities .\nThat would be an existential threat to Catholic healthcare in the United States .\nAccording to Douglas Wilson , CEO of the Catholic Benefits Association and a member of the CHCLA board of directors , Catholic hospitals will be faced \u201c with the choice of complying with the mandates or closing their doors.\n\u201d To which I would add a potential third option : selling to a secular institution to prevent the community harm caused by closing or violating Catholic doctrine by complying .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the model for anti-Catholic healthcare policies that could soon go national .\nFirst , the California courts and the United States Supreme Court are allowing Minton v. Dignity Health , a discrimination lawsuit against Dignity Health , a Catholic hospital , to proceed to trial .\nThe case involves a patient who sued Dignity Health under California \u2019 s anti-discrimination law after the hospital system refused to provide a hysterectomy for the purpose of sex reassignment .\nThere were two bases for Dignity \u2019 s refusal .\nFirst , the surgery would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthcare directives , normal body functions can only be interfered with to treat or prevent pathologies .\nSecond , the surgery would have sterilized the patient .\nUnder Catholic moral teaching , medical acts that result in sterilization can only be performed to treat disease .\nThese moral principles do not target certain patients but apply to all patients .\nThat didn \u2019 t matter to the California courts .\nBecause the anti-discrimination law in question applies generally\u2014and because California does not have a state Religious Freedom Restoration Act\u2014the case will proceed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ordered to pay millions in damages , it could be curtains for the practice of Catholic medicine in California .\nMeanwhile , last year , the regents of UC Health ( the hospital system run by the University of California ) voted to begin breaking the existing affiliation between UC Health and Catholic hospitals if the latter don \u2019 t adhere to the \u201c values \u201d of secular institutions .\nUC Health has a contract with some Catholic hospitals to provide services to patients in areas where there are no UC hospitals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan , Catholic hospitals will be forced to choose between following Catholic moral teaching or continuing to care for the patients they currently serve .\nThis much is sure .\nReligious freedom in the healthcare context is under concerted attack by the political left and liberal politicians .\nThe crisis time for religious pluralism in the United States is fast approaching .\nThe need for an organization like the CHCLA could not be more pressing\u2014or its launch more timely .", "author": "Wesley J.

meta-analysis conducted by the Johns Hopkins University \u2019 s Institute of Applied Economics reviewed 24 prominent COVID-19 scientific studies and concluded both that the lockdowns of the U.S. economy prevented very few deaths while causing tremendous societal harm ( pdf ) .\n\u201c Lockdowns during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic have had devastating effects , \u201d the authors reported .\nWorse , \u201c They have contributed to reducing economic activity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political unrest , contributing to domestic violence , and undermining liberal democracy .\nThese costs to society must be compared to the benefits of lockdowns , which our meta-analysis has shown are marginal at best.\n\u201d Not only that , but the authors advised \u201c lockdowns should be rejected out of hand as a pandemic policy instrument.\n\u201d Holy cow !\nBased on this data , we made a terrible mistake closing countless stores , shuttering restaurants , and locking the doors of service businesses .\nThat \u2019 s a huge story worthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the very least , it offers a means to judge the advice given by our most prominent \u201c expert \u201d COVID warriors\u2014such as Dr. Anthony Fauci and the influential bioethicist Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel , both of whom were enthusiastic lockdown boosters .\nSo , are you aware of the story ?\nIf you read The Epoch Times regularly or watch Fox News , you almost certainly are .\nBoth journalistic organizations covered the news appropriately .\nBut if your primary source for understanding current events is the New York Times , reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you became aware of it , because as of this writing\u2014nearly a week after the study was made public\u2014the \u201c paper of record \u201d has not considered the study to be \u201c news that \u2019 s fit to print.\n\u201d Why might this be ?\nCOVID has been caught up in the American culture war .\nWhen it comes to such contentious ideological and political controversies , the NY Times is not a reliable news source .\nFor example , the paper is bitterly opposed to all things Donald Trump .\nDuring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote that \u201c non-opinion journalists \u201d should \u201c throw out the textbook of American journalism \u201d requiring \u201c objectivity \u201d and \u201c balance \u201d to help prevent Trump from being elected .\nThat bias continued throughout President Trump \u2019 s term in office .\nThe paper even won a Pulitzer Prize for its story on the false Trump \u201c Russian collusion \u201d conspiracy theory .\nThe paper \u2019 s anti-Trump reporting bias extended to its COVID coverage .\nIndeed , even in that matter of crucial public concern , the paper seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always wrong .\nGiven that Trump opposed lockdowns early-on , covering the Johns Hopkins findings would indicate that he was right .\nCan \u2019 t have that !\nThe story also cuts against the paper \u2019 s clear propensity to believe mainstream science and medical \u201c experts , \u201d while denigrating heterodox scientific thinkers .\nIn this regard , the Johns Hopkins analysis specifically validates the views expressed in The Great Barrington Declaration ( GBD ) , a document signed by prominent physicians that decried lockdowns as causing more harm than good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s reporting sought to discredit the GBD from the beginning .\nCan \u2019 t have that , either .\nIt \u2019 s not just Trump and COVID .\nThe NY Times has long ignored stories that would cut against its cultural prejudices .\nThis is important because much of the mainstream media follow the paper \u2019 s lead .\nIn practice , that often means that if a story isn \u2019 t in the NY Times , it barely exists .\nI have first-hand experience with the power of the NY Times to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in writing about the Terri Schiavo case as an advocate for saving her life .\nMy opinion pieces appeared regularly in conservative media , mostly The Weekly Standard and National Review .\nBut it was frustratingly difficult to gain traction for the story nationally , because the NY Times never bothered to report it\u2014until it did with a very biased news hook .\nWhen the Florida legislature passed a law designed to save Terri \u2019 s life , Operation Rescue \u2019 s controversial leader Randall Terry stood alongside Terri \u2019 s family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NY Times reported on its front page\u2014using Terry \u2019 s presence to miscast the vote as a decision \u201c that emboldens the religious right.\n\u201d And with the snap of the Grey Lady \u2019 s fingers , the Schiavo case was transformed from a story about a desperate family trying to save the life of their beloved Terri into a bitter front in the nation \u2019 s culture war .\nThat gave the rest of the media their marching orders .\nFrom then on , most mainstream outlets treated the Terri Schiavo case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abortion stories .\nDoes the NY Times \u2019 s silence on the Johns Hopkins findings mean the paper will never report the story ?\nPerhaps .\nThe NY Times can \u2019 t be shamed into covering stories it prefers to ignore .\nMore likely\u2014if its methodological history holds true\u2014as in the Schiavo story , the editors will get around to mentioning the study in a context that allows it to discredit or mitigate its conclusions , or at a time when it has become such old news that it \u2019 s unlikely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boost the reputation of Trump .\nLook , I \u2019 m not saying that the NY Times is the CNN of newspapers .\nEven I won \u2019 t go that far .\nThe paper employs some excellent journalists and often reports important , high-quality stories .\nBut I do believe that in its present ideological iteration , it \u2019 s unworthy to be considered \u201c the newspaper of record.\n\u201d Its biases are too pronounced and its agendas too partisan .\nPerhaps the time has come for the paper to change its masthead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalism : \u201c All the news that we see fit to print .\n\u201d", "author": "Wesley J.

explains Weikart .\nHitler and the Nazis believed that the Nordic or Aryan Europeans , which included Germans , were a superior race , and they viewed Jews , blacks , Slavs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Worse , Hitler and other Nazis drew upon Darwin \u2019 s theory of evolution , and in particular ideas laid out in Darwin \u2019 s The Descent of Man , as well as the work of prominent early Darwinists , to

the claim that Hitler was a biblical creationist .\nFar from it , Weikart insists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his might-is-right ethic was drawn explicitly from Darwinian principles .\nWeikart then moves into

"source": "discoveryinstitute", "title": "Affirmative Action is a Symptom of Our Failing K-12 Education System", "content": "Once again , the Supreme Court is set to review race-conscious admissions policies , this time those of Harvard University and the University of North Carolina .\nThough I don \u2019 t favor affirmative action policies , I would argue that both proponents and critics of affirmative action overlook a far more important issue : the failure of America \u2019 s K-12 education system , which creates the wide educational disparities affirmative action is intended to remedy in the first place .\nAffirmative action came about as we currently know it through a President John F. Kennedy executive order in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affirmative action to ensure applicants are employed and that employees are treated without regard to their race , creed , color , or national origin.\n\u201d By the late 1960s , universities were voluntarily considering race in admissions processes , some going as far as to establish racial admission quotas .\nThis was not the original intent .\nIn the landmark 1978 Regents of the University of California v. Bakke decision , the U.S. Supreme Court declared that racial quotas violated equal protection rights .\nHowever , the court established that higher education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowing race to be a factor in university admissions to promote diversity in the classroom .\nWith the case currently before the Supreme Court , the plaintiffs , Students for Fair Admissions , argue that the use of race by Harvard and UNC in their admissions processes gives unconstitutional preferential treatment to applicants from \u201c underrepresented \u201d racial groups \u2014 leading to highly qualified students , particularly Asian-American students , being rejected while lesser qualified students are being accepted .\nThis was , of course , not the intent of affirmative action in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it can be argued that it is an effect .\nBesides taking away a seat from a student more likely to succeed , it can also be argued that granting admission to lesser qualified students to meet diversity goals can also lead to their struggling or even dropping out of the university .\nIf those students were directed to a post-secondary education they academically qualified for , they would have a greater opportunity for success .\nThe current Supreme Court case will , yet again , continue the ongoing controversy because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symptom of a larger problem : traditional K-12 public education is utterly failing black and Hispanic students in the major urban areas in America where most of them reside .\nIf affirmative action continues in university admission practices while that problem remains unsolved , we will continue to see black and Hispanic students admitted to post-secondary schools for which they may not be qualified or prepared .\nFor example , in California , from 2015-2019 , black and Latino students significantly trailed white and Asian students in math proficiency .\nBlack students had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 28 % for Latinos , 54 % for whites , and 74 % for Asians .\nReading proficiency over the same period was also a dismal 33 % for black students and 41 % for Latino students , compared to 65 % and 77 % for White and Asian students .\nThis achievement gap is consistent across America .\nStudents who significantly trail other students and perform academically below that of basic proficiency are ill-prepared to enter rigorous universities .\nAffirmative action will continue its controversial legacy in America \u2019 s ongoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all students have access to the quality K-12 education necessary to grant them an opportunity for more comparable levels of educational attainment .\nOnce all students are provided an opportunity to participate in a high-quality , innovative K-12 education system that personalizes learning time , instructional methods , and support , affirmative action ( which was always intended to be a temporary measure ) , will no longer intervene as a misguided solution to closing the achievement gap .\nWe should all recognize the historical plight of blacks in America , a significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of access to a quality education .\nBut however well-meaning , affirmative action is not the answer .\nIt fails to address the root causes of educational performance disparities , creates an atmosphere of unequal opportunity and protection , and can even have negative effects on the very students who are meant to reap its benefits .\nWe should instead come together and focus our efforts on reforming and redesigning K-12 education .\nThe lasting benefit of a high-quality education for each individual student would transform families , communities , and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foster racial progress and reconciliation .", "author": "Walter Myers III", "url":

students and their parents , along with prospective graduate and professional school students , consult university ranking lists .\nMost well-known is the U.S. News & World Report Ranking List .\nThese rankings have an indisputable impact on universities and a powerful influence on prospective students .\nU.S. News & World Report , the first college ranking list , made a big splash upon its launch in 1983 .\nThe influence of the list is profound .\nIt not only attracts more applicants and increases alumni donor support to a university , but it also offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , staff , alumni , students , and their parents \u2014 bragging rights and a system for top universities to maintain their recruiting dominance .\nIn short , the higher the ratings the more attractive the university .\nThe U.S. News & World Report rating methodology is based on the following percentage weights assigned to each ranking factor : \u2022 Math And Evidence-Based Reading and Writing Portions of the SAT and the Composite Act Scores ( 5 % ) \u2022 Percent Faculty with Terminal Degree in their Field ( 3 % ) Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wake Forest University and President at Academic Influence perceives a weakness in the methodology : At the top of the list is an assessment survey that goes out to university presidents , provosts , and deans of admissions around the country .\nThis most certainly represents one way to rank quality .\nBut it \u2019 s really a way to rank the kind of popularity that we humans are prone to value \u2014 prestige .\nWhile a future employer may care about prestige , it should not be the top metric for ranking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assessment survey has an echo effect , meaning that the surveys reflect the rankings from the previous year .\nIn other words , when a president , provost , or dean is asked to list the good schools , they are no doubt influenced by the list itself .\nIndeed , the most heavily weighted component reinforces the U.S News \u2019 own rankings .\nBased on the view that the U.S. News & World Report rating system may not be the most accurate reflection of the school , Macosko , along with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative method to ranking colleges and universities .\nThey use big data to assess a school \u2019 s influence .\nMacosko explains : We use three databases .\nTwo of the databases allow us to rank schools in two important ways : by their influence and by their Concentrated Influence\u2122 .\nThe third database tells us where students chose to go to college when they had a choice between two or more schools and gives us each school \u2019 s desirability in the eyes of a typical student .\nSo , between influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have three powerful ways to rank universities .\nInfluence and desirability are two general ways to think about the quality of schools .\nInfluence tells students and their parents whether people who work at the school or graduate from the school have a big impact on the world .\nDesirability reveals the popularity of each school and is a metric that other people have used to rank universities , though sometimes under a different name .\nConcentrated Influence\u2122 , on the other hand , is a new way to think about university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for each university , then dividing by the undergraduate population .\nThe rationale is that , suppose you are interested in studying math and you have been accepted to two universities that both have five very influential math professors and five equally influential math alumni .\nOne school has 1,000 undergrads while the other has 10,000 .\nWhich one should you attend if you want to have the best chance of interacting with the five amazing professors or be helped in your career by those five amazing alumni ?\nMost likely , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have a better chance of getting some time with those influencers .\nThat is why we treat Concentrated Influence\u2122 differently than the other two metrics and use it when we talk about the \u201c best \u201d colleges .\nWe start by determining the influence of the alumni , professors , and administrators , then total them to equate the influence of the school .\nInfluence is calculated by combining the number of times individuals are mentioned on Wikipedia with the number of times their writing is referenced at Crossref and Semantic Scholar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two open-source databases that contain hundreds of millions of papers , articles , books , editorial , etc . )\nIn short , Macosko aspires to offer a more objective way to rank colleges and universities \u2014 an approach centered on the university \u2019 s influence rather than its prestige .\nCould this be a way to improve college rankings \u2014 providing prospective students with a tool that gives a more meaningful assessment of a university \u2019 s rank relative to other universities ?\nYet , a prospective student may have other important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university .\nFor example , how effective are the faculty as teachers as opposed to their ability to advance their fields through research and publishing ?\nTo what degree does the university stimulate open inquiry rather than ideological indoctrination ( which is the opposite of education ) ?\nThe answers to these questions are not easily derived from either peer assessments or big data analysis .\nNo doubt , it \u2019 s a challenging undertaking to effectively create a system and gather data to meaningfully rank institutions of higher learning .\nAcademic Influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant improvement over U.S. News \u2019 s ubiquitous ranking system \u2014 one that could over time disrupt the university marketplace .\nThe beneficiaries could be high-performing institutions that have been overshadowed by universities deemed more prestigious .\nOf course , the ultimate beneficiaries of this new university-ranking list competition are the students searching for the best university to attend \u2014 as well as their parents who typically foot the bill .", "author": "Keri D.

many of them Asians , who push their students to excel .\nThomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria , Virginia , is the best high school in the nation , according to U.S. News & World Report .\nSadly , its percentage of African Americans admitted during the 2020-2021 school year was 1.77 % , even though Blacks represent 10 % of students in Fairfax County Public Schools

Dying\u2019 Normalizes Suicide", "content": "Here \u2019 s the advocacy scam : \u201c Death with dignity \u201d activists push suicide facilitation for some people\u2014but still claim to oppose suicide per se because they call doctor-prescribed death by the euphemism , \u201c medical aid in dying \u201d ( MAID ) .\nThen , they claim that the availability of MAID will reduce rates of \u201c premature deaths \u201d because people with serious illnesses will feel comforted by the ready availability of an easy way out , and so , remain longer among the living .\nFinally , to assure that death statistics support these advocacy memes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to redefine doctor-prescribed death as not legally suicide .\nSome statutes even go so far as to require the doctor who signs the death certificate to report falsely that the cause was the underlying medical condition , rather than an intentional overdose of barbiturates .\nThe point is to artificially reduce official suicide rates as the actual number of self-killings increase .\nSuch shameless sophistry .\nSuicide describes what is done , not why .\nBesides , every suicidal person would want to live , but for the reason they want to commit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child hadn \u2019 t been hit by a car , she would want to live .\nIf the businessman \u2019 s enterprise had not collapsed , he would not be thinking of killing himself .\nIf the person did not feel hopelessly addicted to alcohol , suicide would never have entered his mind .\nStill , the great advocacy scam has convinced many people to separate assisted suicide in their minds from suicide per se .\nBut that dichotomy is now collapsing under the weight of data .\nNot only are suicide rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legalize assisted suicide , but an explicit association has been established between these concurrent phenomena .\nA peer-reviewed study was just published in the Journal of Mental Health Ethics that compared suicide rates in four European countries that permit euthanasia/assisted suicide versus demographically similar neighboring countries that do not .\nAnd guess what ?\nNot only are increased suicide rates associated with legalization of assisted suicide/euthanasia , but the hypothesis that premature deaths will be reduced was thoroughly debunked .\nSpecifically , the study concluded that there are not \u201c any grounds \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c an effective form of suicide prevention.\n\u201d Indeed , \u201c there is no evidence that it would be beneficial in relation to suicide prevention overall.\n\u201d Moreover , \u201c if one considers the community as a whole , it is not the prohibition of EAS [ euthanasia/assisted suicide ] but the introduction of EAS that is associated with \u2018 evidence of premature death \u2019 \u201d ( My emphasis . )\nThis is not to say that assisted suicide is the sole cause of the suicide crisis .\nOur nihilism has many parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor .\nShould we be surprised ?\nStripped of its patina of compassion and behind the movement \u2019 s euphemistic deflections , euthanasia advocacy promotes suicide .\nLegalization also gives the state \u2019 s imprimatur to self-killing as a legitimate solution to human suffering .\nPopular culture amplifies this destructive message ubiquitously in novels , television programs , and movies .\nThe media also boosts suicide by lauding hastened death as empowering and \u201c dying on one \u2019 s own terms.\n\u201d Indeed , consider the sad case of Brittany Maynard , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracting terminal brain cancer .\nShe was not only the subject of repeated cover stories in People Magazine but was named by CNN as one of 2014 \u2019 s \u201c most extraordinary people.\n\u201d To say the least , the message communicated is decidedly not anti-suicide !\nEven more worryingly , contemporary assisted suicide advocacy increasingly includes expanded categories of suffering people .\nAn article just published in the Journal of Eating Disorders\u2014a respected medical publication\u2014urged that anorexia patients \u201c who are severely physiologically compromised , and whose end-of life suffering results from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be afforded access to medical aid in dying in locations where such assistance has been legalized\u2014just like other patients with terminal conditions.\n\u201d In other words , instead of psychiatrists working unequivocally to help keep these eating disorder patients alive , they could instead help kill them .\nThere \u2019 s a word for that : abandonment .\nMoreover , once we start permitting one category of mentally ill people to receive suicide facilitation , what reason is there to believe it would stop with them ?\nIndeed , the article notes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year than anorexia .\nIf that is so , logic would require expanding assisted suicide to include people with drug addictions so implacable that they see death as their only way out .\nThink of the irony .\nAn intentional overdose of opioids would be deemed a \u201c treatment \u201d for intractable addiction to opioids .\nThe mind boggles !\nThe elderly and people with dementia are also being targeted by suicide pushers as proper subjects of facilitated death .\nIndeed , Compassion and Choices\u2014which used to be known more honestly as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicide by self-starvation\u2014known in euthanasia movement parlance as \u201c voluntary stop eating and drinking \u201d ( VSED ) .\nThe site describes this as a \u201c natural death , \u201d but of course , it is really a form of suicide\u2014facilitated by a doctor who prescribes drugs to blunt the agony caused by self-dehydration and starvation .\nSome bioethicists even argue that nursing homes and caregivers should be legally required to starve patients who willingly eat and drink if they have serious dementia and previously ordered themselves starved in an advance medical directive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legalizing assisted suicide prevents suicide , advocates claim that allowing people to order themselves deprived of sustenance would prevent earlier suicides .\nThus , bioethicist Thaddeus Mason Pope has written : \u201c To avoid the problem of premature death , many have proposed that individuals complete advance directives that instruct others to stop hand feeding .\nThis is known as \u201c advance VSED \u201d or \u201c SED by AD.\n\u201d Again .\nThe mind boggles .\nHere \u2019 s the bottom line .\nThe more a society becomes pro some suicides , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unless we recognize that the proper answer to suicide ideation is suicide prevention\u2014for everyone , not just some\u2014the \u201c right \u201d to commit suicide could become as fundamental as the right to life .\nThe victims of such a nihilistic mindset will be the elderly , people with disabilities , the mentally ill , and the seriously sick in an ever-widening swath of premature deaths .", "author": "Wesley J.

Crunch", "content": "Former Mayor of South Bend , Indiana , and current Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg recently argued that electric vehicles were an affordable solution to the now record gas prices .\nBut he didn \u2019 t specifically say how .\nIt turns out that if one considers the real costs and practicalities of owning and operating an electric vehicle , his statement is false .\nWhile the prices of electric vehicles are indeed coming down , the average electric vehicle still costs more than $ 50,000 , which is vastly more than most Americans can afford .\nAnd sadly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric vehicles that are being hurt the most by the massive inflation brought about in large part by the Biden administration \u2019 s over year-long war on fossil fuel production\u2014which are now going to be exacerbated by sanctions on Russian oil due to the war with Ukraine .\nJust last week , former Michigan governor and current Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm reiterated that the country is currently in an energy transition off oil and gas , seeming oblivious to the financial pain the Biden administration is causing families across America .\nDo the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nLet \u2019 s look at the numbers .\nIn 2021 , 14.9 million light vehicles were sold in America , of which about 3 % were electric vehicles .\nThe average price of a new gas-powered light vehicle in 2020 was $ 38,960 .\nSo the purchaser of an electric vehicle would need to be able to make up the difference in fuel costs to justify an electric vehicle purchase .\nIt costs less to fuel an electric vehicle , but since the costs vary wildly based on where and when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a meaningful comparison .\nBut let \u2019 s consider some real-world initial operating costs and practical issues .\nCharging at home , late at night , is the least costly option .\nBut charging on standard household current ( called Level 1 charging ) can take up to three days depending on battery capacity .\nInstalling a 240-volt circuit allows for charging overnight ( called Level 2 charging ) , but purchasing the charger and having it installed can cost as much as $ 1500 .\nThen there are the annual costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 24 kWh to drive 100 miles .\nIn Southern California , electric vehicle owners qualify for a \u201c Time-of-Use \u201d ( TOU ) rate plan , which during the winter months is 21 cents/kWh off-peak ( between 9 p.m. and 8 a.m. ) .\nGiven the average miles driven per year ( 14,300 miles per the Federal Highway Administration ) , the driver would need 3,432 kWh of charge per year , which at 21 cents/kWh costs $ 720.72 .\nThis is roughly one-half the annual cost to fuel an average gasoline-powered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Labor Statistics was $ 1,568 in 2020 .\nGiven that an average electric vehicle costs about $ 11,000 more than a gasoline powered vehicle , it would take 14 years on average to break even in terms of fuel costs , not factoring in the cost of installing a 240-volt charger .\nIn short , while the numbers are increasing year over year , particularly as gas prices increase , the lower costs to fuel an electric vehicle over the life of a vehicle is nowhere near making up for the increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Furthermore , if it \u2019 s impractical for a homeowner to charge at home , or if the electric vehicle owner lives in an apartment , then the owner will have no choice but to leverage fast DC charging pay stations , which are more costly .\nSome automobile manufacturers provide free fast DC charging , covering a set dollar amount or a period of time ( some up to three years ) .\nAfter that , the owner pays .\nAs an example , in California , Electrify America fast DC charging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan , but for a small monthly fee will only charge 31 cents/kWh on their Pass+ monthly plan .\nClearly , the membership plan makes more sense , but it is still 50 % more than charging at home late at night .\nAnd again , a fast charger would most likely be the only practical option for an apartment dweller .\nAll these factors make the electric vehicle even less attractive in terms of the cost .\nSo far , I have only discussed the costs of owning an electric vehicle .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the owner of an Audi e-tron electric vehicle ( who also happens to have solar that helps lower my electricity costs ) , are the downsides of owning an electric vehicle .\nI personally love mine .\nBut they are simply not for everyone , and you should not be gaslighted into believing you need to own one .\nIn short , electric vehicles are highly inconvenient , unless you live in a house and charge at night with a Level 2 charger .\nThey are even more of an inconvenience on longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around battery capacity .\nFirst , anyone who purchases an electric vehicle should know that current batteries degrade over time\u2014they generally have a useful life of eight to ten years at best .\nAnd degradation can be greatly accelerated if an electric vehicle owner regularly charges to 100 % with fast DC chargers .\nThat is why virtually all manufacturers strongly suggest that on a regular basis to not charge an electric vehicle above 80 % , and to not allow the battery to discharge to below 20 % .\nAnd by no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battery to discharge close to 0 % .\nIt \u2019 s okay to charge to 100 % for the occasional long trip , but it is your responsibility to protect the life of your battery , particularly if you are purchasing the car and not leasing .\nNot doing so can be very costly for you at trade-in time if your battery only has 70 % of its original capacity after four to five years of use .\nSecond , most electric vehicles have a lower range relative to gasoline-powered vehicles .\nTesla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most practical based on the requirement for normal operation within the 20-80 % state of charge ( SoC ) .\nBut if you own an electric vehicle with the typical range of between 240 to 300 miles , then the SoC for the lower range would yield about 144 drivable miles , while on the higher range , a full SoC would yield about 180 miles .\nIf you lack the convenience of Level 2 charging at home , this will mean charging twice a week at fast DC chargers in both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 275 miles per week ( 14,300 miles divided by 52 weeks ) .\nThird , it typically takes about 30-40 minutes to charge a car from 20 % to 80 % at a fast DC charger , depending on the capacity , which is typically in the range of 150 kW to 350 kW ( charger capacity can be much lower at retail locations , making them less suitable for receiving a full charge ) .\nOne also must locate an available fast DC charger \u2013 usually by searching the web or with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and more people drive electric vehicles , invariably there will be charging bottlenecks .\nSince it takes so long to charge , owners will typically leave their car to get a coffee or do some quick shopping while they \u2019 re charging .\nSo you must always be prepared to wait even after the charger you are waiting for has completed charging .\nFifth , if you \u2019 re not a good planner , don \u2019 t bother with an electric vehicle .\nYou will often find yourself in a situation where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to safely drive your vehicle to your destination .\nIn that case , you will have to find a fast DC charger and wait , a situation I have found myself in numerous times .\nAgain , do not drive your car down anything close to 0 % , under any circumstances .\nFinally , don \u2019 t buy into the myth that electric vehicles are \u201c zero-emission.\n\u201d Electric vehicles are built using fossil fuels , and manufacturing batteries is an especially dirty business .\nOnly 20 % of the electric power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but again , remember it takes fossil fuels to construct renewable sources of energy ) .\nThe remaining 80 % of the power is generated by natural gas , coal , or nuclear .\nNatural gas and nuclear are actually among the cleanest sources of energy , which you will never hear from the Biden administration .\nIn conclusion , it is not my intent to discourage anyone from purchasing an electric vehicle .\nAs stated above , I have one and I love it .\nIt works great for my low vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge at the fast DC charger while out to lunch a couple of times a week , I can charge from home any time I need to .\nI take good care of my battery as the manufacturer recommends .\nIf you decide to purchase an electric vehicle , take the time to weigh the pros and cons to see if it fits with your own personal lifestyle .\nDon \u2019 t let stubborn , quixotic , utopian-minded politicians gaslight you into purchasing one .\nIf you have a real concern for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should feel good about purchasing either a hybrid or an electric vehicle and you should also be an advocate of clean natural gas and nuclear power along with renewable energy sources .", "author": "Walter Myers III", "url":

soft power resources have mobilized to sever Russian access to financial services , trade , most business opportunities , and international travel .\nRussian oligarchs have been sanctioned , their mega-yachts seized .\nThe United States will henceforth refuse to buy Russian oil .\nEven the hapless United Nations General Assembly condemned Russia in an overwhelming , albeit nonbinding , vote .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruthless dictator bent on expanding his power as he suppresses his own people and commits human rights atrocities requires a robust international response if the world is to remain minimally civilized .\nBut the question must be asked : Why mobilize so effectively against Russian human rights atrocities while concomitantly shrugging at the profound crimes against humanity being committed by the People \u2019 s Republic of China ?\nYes , the Russian invasion is horrific and inexcusable .\nInnocent people are suffering and dying .\nTheir shed blood cries out for a focused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed by the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) any less worthy of a focused international response ?\nFirst , there \u2019 s the active and ongoing genocide inflicted against the Uyghurs of Western China where more than 1 million innocent people have been imprisoned in concentration camps simply because they \u2019 re a Muslim ethnic minority .\nUyghur women are raped as a means of oppression , and often forced to endure involuntary sterilization and abortions ; Uyghur workers are shipped involuntarily throughout the country as literal slaves .\nIt \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut that \u2019 s far from all .\nFalun Gong practitioners are routinely arrested for their beliefs and murdered to supply China \u2019 s \u201c organ tourism \u201d trade .\nThen , there \u2019 s the illegal occupation and cultural genocide of Tibet , the crushing of democracy in Hong Kong against China \u2019 s treaty obligations , its increasingly bellicose threats against the independence of Taiwan , the pernicious social credit system , military incursions against the Indian border , the illegal militarization of the South China Sea , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great COVID-19 coverup\u2014all at the direction of a Communist Party dictatorship as cold , calculating , and indifferent to the sanctity of human life as the man who rules Russia .\nYet , despite all of this\u2014and more\u2014China remains a \u201c respectable \u201d member of the international community .\nHere are some of the reasons why : The adage of a picture being worth a thousand words is multiplied exponentially when shocking images are live-streamed .\nWho among us hasn \u2019 t recoiled at the plight of terrified Ukrainian refugees packing train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destruction of residential neighborhoods and the murderous shooting of fleeing families by the Russian army ?\nWh0 among us hasn \u2019 t shed tears at the widespread misery Putin unleashed ?\nIn contrast , China is an opaque society .\nMost of its evil acts happen internally , in the deepest shadows where no videos photograph the gruesome events to shock the conscience .\nYes , the rapes of Uyghur women are known , but their horrified screams remain unheard .\nThe photos of concentration camps taken from satellites depict huge prison complexes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe mutilated bodies of harvested Falun Gong practitioners aren \u2019 t broadcast to the world because their murders are committed in sterile hospital surgical suites .\nIn short , the horrors of Ukraine are vividly depicted for all to see , but those committed in China remain abstract .\nChina certainly doesn \u2019 t lack for critics .\nBut most of the resistance comes from demonstrations rarely reported in the media and scholarly think tank studies that are insufficient to mobilize popular resistance .\nIn contrast , the opposition to Russia has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Volodymyr Zelensky , who , along with his government , remains in the country under constant threat of sudden violent death .\nZelensky \u2019 s leadership has inspired his country and the world to emotionally support the defense of Ukraine .\nWith no equivalent opposition leader in China around whom to rally , world opposition to CCP policies remains unfocused and flaccid .\nRussia is a huge country geographically , but relatively puny economically , with a GDP smaller than that of Italy , Brazil , and Canada .\nIndeed , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s largest inventory of nuclear arms , it wouldn \u2019 t be a world power .\nThis means there \u2019 s little financial risk for the world \u2019 s countries and corporate conglomerates to disconnect from the Russian economy .\nThe opposite is true of China .\nChina generates more than one third of the world \u2019 s GDP and is the manufacturing center of the world .\nEconomically divorcing the country would cause genuine pain .\nMoreover , the country isn \u2019 t only rich when compared to Russia ; its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the world \u2019 s goods .\nMore insidiously , China uses wealth to insinuate its values into the institutions of the West , ranging from our universities to our entertainment industry , to our political and business organizations .\nMoney buys acquiescence .\nNotice that the same major corporations that boycott Georgia for minor changes to its voting laws\u2014and which have righteously pulled their businesses out of Russia\u2014are inert in the face of China \u2019 s multitudinous human rights abuses .\nFinally , Ukraine is a Western country .\nWhen we see @ @ @ @ @

Answers the Big Bang Evaders", "content": "On this ID the Future , physicist Brian Miller looks at various attempts to evade the mounting evidence that the universe had a beginning , a Big Bang .\nMiller and host Casey Luskin first review the fascinating history of how the eternal universe model of the nineteenth century gave way to the Big Bang model .\nThen Miller walks through about a half a dozen attempts to evade a cosmic beginning after the Big Bang model had won the day .\nThese evasions include the steady state model , the idea of an eternal cyclical universe , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model , our universe exists in a multi-dimensional brane ( not \u201c brain \u201d ) which exists in a higher dimensional space , and our multi-dimensional brane can collide with other branes , with each collision creating a Big Bang moment , a process said to have been going on for all eternity .\nMiller then explains why each of these attempts to evade a true cosmic beginning fail , and he says that if matter , energy , and space came into existence at the moment of the Big Bang , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cosmic beginning is something immaterial .\nAnd since the cosmic beginning was finely tuned in many astonishing ways , Miller says , the cause of the Big Bang has left the signature of intelligent design .\nThe cause , then , is an intelligent , immaterial being and one , obviously , of unimaginable power .\nMiller and Luskin then touch on a final attempt to evade these implications , the idea that the universe could have popped into existence from nothing\u2014no God , no anything .\nBut as Miller shows , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such physicists as Lawrence Krauss and Stephen Hawking , do not actually start from nothing .\nThere is always a something at the ground state , a

transhumanist agenda with the precepts of Christian theology , has been around for some time .\nBut there has been a recent resurgence of interest in the project .\nThe book Religious Transhumanism and Its Critics , published in 2019 , claims to offer \u201c first-hand testimony to the value of the transhumanist vision perceived by the religious mind.\n\u201d The volume includes contributions from a number of Christians .\nThe \u201c Christian Transhumanist Association \u201d ( CTA ) , formed in 2014 , is actively dedicated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participating with God in the redemption , reconciliation , and renewal of the world.\n\u201d The problem with these efforts is that the transhumanist worldview and the Christian faith are incompatible .\nOne can not be a \u201c Christian transhumanist \u201d \u2014 any more than one can be a Christian Buddhist or Christian Muslim .\nTranshumanism is a futuristic social movement .\nIts adherents believe that immortality is attainable in the corporeal world through the wonders of applied technology .\nThe goal is to become \u201c H+ , \u201d or more than human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s Nick Bostrom , Big Tech gurus like Ray Kurzweil , and popularizers like 2016 presidential candidate Zoltan Istvan .\nThey promise that \u201c the singularity \u201d is coming \u2014 the time when a crescendo of scientific advances will make the movement unstoppable and transhumanists will transform themselves into super-beings who can enjoy physical life without end .\nThat transhumanism became a phenomenon is not surprising .\nWestern society is becoming increasingly secular , with an exponential growth of \u201c nones \u201d among the young .\nSuch a societal shift has consequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engenders hopelessness and breeds nihilism .\nThis is the crucial weakness of modern materialism , one that transhumanism seeks to remedy .\nBy offering adherents the hope of technological rescue from the ultimate obliteration of death , transhumanism offers nonbelievers a postmodern twist on faith \u2019 s promise of eternal life .\nI can live forever , the transhumanist believes fervently , if we just develop the technology soon enough .\nBut any attempt to merge transhumanism and Christianity is misguided , for the two are contradictory belief systems .\nTranshumanist dogma is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its purpose eugenic .\nMoreover , it rejects basic Christian tenets like sin , the need for divine forgiveness , the value of redemptive suffering , and eternal salvation .\nTo obfuscate that truth , the CTA website assiduously avoids discussing the actual tenets of transhumanism .\nIt offers jejune statements such as , \u201c We believe that God \u2019 s mission involves the transformation and renewal of creation , \u201d and \u201c We seek growth and progress along every dimension of our humanity.\n\u201d In this way , the CTA conflates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christians certainly can support \u2014 with transhumanism \u2019 s fixation on technology as savior .\nNor does the CTA website discuss the \u201c means \u201d that transhumanist advocates plan to use to attain this utopian vision\u2014not to mention their ethical implications .\nFor example , some transhumanists hope to repeatedly renew their bodies through breeding clones as sources of organ replacements .\nOthers plan to have their heads cryogenically frozen to allow eventual surgical attachment on a different body or a cyborg .\nBut transhumanists \u2019 greatest passion is to eternally save their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is not a transhumanist concept \u2014 via uploading into computer programs , a concept known as \u201c digital immortality.\n\u201d This is hardly what St. Paul meant when he asked , \u201c Death , where is thy sting ?\nGrave , where is thy victory ?\n\u201d Transhumanists not only believe that life is too short , but that human capacities are inadequate .\nThus , the second great goal of transhumanism is \u201c morphological freedom , \u201d i.e.\n, radical quality improvement\u2014not through self-discipline , embracing the virtues , or focused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materialistic means such as gene editing , brain implants , and merging with AI technologies .\nThe ultimate purpose of this quest isn \u2019 t spiritual \u2014 not theosis or sanctification \u2014 but to become super-beings in a materialistic sense .\nAs Istvan wrote in 2016 in the Huffington Post : \u201c We must force our evolution in the present day via our reasoning , inventiveness , and especially our scientific technology .\nIn short , we must embrace transhumanism \u2014 the radical field of science that aims to turn humans into , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gods.\n\u201d It \u2019 s hard to see how any of that squares with the Christian \u2019 s call to humility .\nTranshumanists don \u2019 t just want to manipulate their own bodies , but also those of their children .\nThey hope to do this through genetic engineering and unnatural means of family formation .\nAccording to the Transhumanist Bill of Rights , \u201c All sentient entities are entitled to reproductive freedom , including through novel means such as the creation of mind clones , monoparent children , or benevolent artificial general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even gotten into how , by granting rights to AI computers and proposing to \u201c upgrade \u201d animals into rational beings , the movement rejects Christianity \u2019 s view of human uniqueness .\nReaders won \u2019 t find any of this on the CTA website .\nRather , the CTA claims that by embracing transhumanism , Christians can \u201c grow into our identity as humans made in the image of God.\n\u201d But Christians embrace spiritual growth through prayer , fasting , and acts of asceticism , not superficial technological improvements in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ill and disabled as somehow lesser .\nMoreover , the Christian faith calls us to show compassion toward others , rather than being obsessed with self .\nChristians are commanded to feed the hungry , invite the stranger in , clothe the naked , and visit the sick and imprisoned , for by doing these acts of mercy to the least among us , we do them unto Christ .\nFirst principles matter , and those of transhumanism and Christianity could not be more contradictory .\nTranshumanism is materialistic .\nChristianity is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees the fallen world realistically .\nTranshumanism perceives immortality as something that can be achieved by men .\nChristianity identifies eternal salvation as the mercy of a loving

Board of Education .\nThe first thing to understand about CRT is its underlying ideology which is , indeed , openly based on the neo-Marxist critical thought of Antonio Gramsci ( all societies are divided into two basic groups : hegemonic oppressors and the oppressed ) applied to race .\nCRT , as a movement of legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outgrowth of Critical Legal Studies ( CLS ) , a school of critical theory among a collection of white , male , leftist legal scholars of the 1970s who challenged the American legal system , arguing that it served to only legitimize an oppressive social order .\nAs such , critical race theorists agreed with the CLS scholars that traditional American norms of the market system , a pluralistic society , and classical liberalism are found wholly wanting with respect to producing a just society .\nHowever , they felt CLS failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly with respect to improving conditions for oppressed people of color .\nNow it is important to understand that CRT , which was originally a movement of law , has spread out to a variety of spin-off disciplines such as education , voting rights , women \u2019 s studies , ethnic studies ( e.g.\n, Latino , Asian ) , and LGBT issues .\nHowever , my focus will be on the primary thrust of CRT from a legal perspective and its subsequent relation to education .\nThus , we will now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with respect to what the movement is for , what it is against , and what it is specifically calling for in terms of remediating past and current social injustices against people of color within the American legal system and the broader culture .\nThe first key tenet of CRT , which is important to understanding the theory , is its assertion that the law has been historically complicit in upholding white supremacy , which is the social domination and subordination of blacks and other people of color .\nThough the contemporary legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color-blind \u201d and subsequently treat all people equally , it is defective in that it only serves to remedy the most blatant forms of discrimination , such as mortgage redlining and academic hiring practices .\nEven though the law has worked to suppress explicit forms of white racism , everyday social practices in America continue outside the purview of legal remediation .\nIn other words , critical race theorists believe racism has been and continues to be \u201c pervasive , systemic , and deeply ingrained , \u201d as noted by critical race theorist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , liberal ideals such as \u201c color-blindness , \u201d \u201c formal legal equality , \u201d and \u201c integrationism \u201d are simply rhetorical tools of power incorporated in American academic and workplace institutions , supported by Supreme Court jurisprudence that has accepted and confirmed an oppressive racial regime in the decades after the civil rights era .\nThey cite court cases where the Supreme Court has eschewed race-conscious policies in the areas of minority set-asides , de facto racial segregation , and voting rights .\nInterestingly , critical race theorists admit these decisions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHowever , critical theory rejects , as noted , the classic liberal visions of racial justice , seeing them as an attack on government efforts to address continuing societal racial discrimination .\nThe second key tenet of CRT , sometimes called \u201c interest convergence , \u201d is a notion advanced by critical race theorist Derrick Bell , who argues that in achieving racial equality , the interests of blacks will only be accommodated when they converge with the interests of whites .\nIn other words , a judicial remedy for racial equality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any way threatens the superior social status of middle- and upper-class whites .\nThus , any racial remedy as an outward manifestation must , in the subconscious of the judiciary , advance or at least cause no important societal harm to this group .\nPerhaps shocking to some , Bell uses Brown as a notable legal example whose result was more in the self-interest of elite whites than the court \u2019 s desire to help blacks .\nIt ameliorated criticism from communist countries during the Cold War , and reassured blacks who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they fought against in World War II , acknowledged their full human dignity .\nAs to the first tenet , it is an unfortunate fact that in the past , laws were sometimes explicitly written to discriminate against black and other students of color , and even neutral laws were often intentionally and purposefully abused .\nHowever , those discriminatory laws have largely either been struck down by the courts or replaced with non-discriminatory laws by Congress and state legislatures .\nWhile it is true that color-blind , neutral liberal ideology has its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the hearts and minds of human beings in their everyday social practices to completely eliminate discrimination , the argument that racism continues to be systemic and supported by law is unconvincing .\nI also find the notion of interest convergence tenuous at best in the 21st century .\nWith respect to education , the Brown decision did indeed yield benefits for white Americans .\nHowever , the primary benefactors were blacks in terms of its striking down longstanding , intentionally racist and discriminatory school policies .\nWhat I think Bell gets correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Brown was wrongly on integration , which had highly mixed results , often ending in violence and \u201c white flight \u201d over the course of the next two decades .\nAlas , many schools are just as segregated now as they were prior to 1954 .\nBell argues that the focus should have been on providing black children with equal and adequate school resources , wholly apart from whether the school was integrated or non-integrated .\nWhat Bell and other critical race theorists also get right is that public school systems in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race-conscious approach to K-12 education advocated by critical race theorists to remediate all that went wrong after Brown is problematic , there may be common ground here .\nNamely , we would certainly agree that urban public school failures are in large part due to their massive and inefficient bureaucracies , a one-size-fits-all approach to education with little to no innovation , and teachers \u2019 unions that advocate for teachers at the expense of students and parents .\nIronically , those pushing for the \u201c teaching \u201d of CRT in K-12 education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are among those whom critical race theorists argue are largely responsible for the lack of educational equity and attainment in urban public school systems today .", "author": "Walter Myers III", "url":

( Jim Carrey ) has no idea his life is actually a popular TV show .\nEverything has been fabricated \u2014 his parents , his friends , his marriage , his job .\nBut things start happening \u2014 a studio light falls from the sky , a fake elevator reveals a hidden backstage room .\nSuddenly , Truman is determined to discover the truth of his existence .\nRebelling against the script being played out all around him , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and discover the life he was made to live .\nLike Truman , most of us are blissfully unaware that the digital screens in our lives \u2014 smartphones , tablets , computers and TVs \u2014 have been shaping our desires and influencing our choices .\nA slew of programmers , designers and tech elites have found effective methods to intentionally hook us in , keep us engaged and encourage behaviors that benefit them , and are often damaging for us .\nWe play along , unaware , until the moment we start to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on .\nOnly then can we become intentional with screens and reclaim our lives .\nIn his book [ Un ] Intentional : How Screens Secretly Shape Your Desires and How You Can Break Free , veteran web programmer and teacher Doug Smith pulls the curtain back on how our screens influence us .\nHe starts by telling us the bad news .\nSmith details a 2021 study from eMarketer showing that the average U.S. adult increased their time on digital media to nearly 8 hours a day , with over three hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star of our own primetime daily production and we think we \u2019 re calling the shots .\nAfter all , it \u2019 s our choice to open the apps , play the games and log onto the streaming platforms .\nWe \u2019 re in charge , right ?\nActually , no .\nThe creators behind those apps , games and platforms are running the show .\n\u201c Since desire precedes a free choice , \u201d says Smith , \u201c manipulating desires is a powerful way to control people \u2019 s choices.\n\u201d And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These content creators incorporate the latest psychological , behavioral and neurological science into the design of their software and hardware .\nThey \u2019 ve studied the effects of dopamine released during engagement with their products .\nThey know how addiction works in humans .\nThey \u2019 ve even taken cues from casino designers and successful propagandists of the early 20th century .\nAnd the master stroke ?\nWhile encouraging us to do whatever we feel or desire , they \u2019 re manipulating those feelings and desires in ways that profit them .\nMost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t even know this is happening .\nBut then Smith delivers the good news .\nRight now is a great time to reverse the intentionality imbalance back in our favor and live out our potential .\nSmith shows us how to do this in the second half of his book .\nAs with most problems in life , becoming aware is the first step .\nThen it \u2019 s time to examine .\n\u201c Without the ability to think deeply , \u201d says Smith , \u201c we lose our capacity to evaluate what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get the data on your screen usage .\nKeep a daily log .\nIf your phone has an app that tracks screen time , consult it .\nUse an online questionnaire tool to assess your screen habits .\nDialogue with people that know you and love you .\nWhile reflecting on your present behaviors , habits , practices and attitudes as they relate to screens , Smith suggests some postures of evaluation .\nThese include having grace with yourself , being patient and staying optimistic while you self-evaluate .\nYou didn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It happened slowly .\nThe process of turning things around will also be slow and deliberate .\nGive yourself time to make lasting changes .\nAfter learning his whole world is an illusion , Truman commits to finding an authentic life , even if he must die trying .\n\u201c You \u2019 re going to have to kill me !\n\u201d he screams as the TV show \u2019 s unseen director forces Truman to endure a sudden storm .\nBut he clings to his boat , undaunted .\nIf you \u2019 re going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 ll need Truman-like determination , too .\nOnce you \u2019 ve honestly assessed your screen habits and cast a vision for your life , it \u2019 s time for action .\nTo help you , Smith lays out five life-altering practices .\nThey involve removing what entangles you and replacing harmful habits with helpful ones that will allow you to pursue your calling .\nIt won \u2019 t be easy , but nothing worthwhile is .\nIt \u2019 s your life and you only get to live it once .\n\u201c In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear , \u201d says the TV show \u2019 s director in a final attempt to deceive Truman .\n\u201c I know you better than you know yourself.\n\u201d And with their immense data stores , powerful algorithms and addictive platforms , the elites of Big Tech could say the very same thing to you .\nBut they \u2019 d be wrong .\nYou are writing your story and it \u2019 s time to start a new chapter .", "author": "Andrew McDiarmid", "url":

"content": "New York Governor Kathy Hochul \u2019 s recent announcement for overhauling the K-12 education system in New York rightly recognizes the teacher shortage , which has become a crisis .\nBut it does not change the underlying incentives for attracting talented people into teaching or retaining the teachers who do a good job educating their students .\nFrom urban to suburban to rural , schools are desperate for personnel to staff classrooms .\nClassrooms are often forced to combine to ensure an adult is present to supervise students .\nAnd administrators are regularly substituting as teachers , lunchroom monitors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing school personnel out and reduce the student experience .\nWhen the human supply runs too short , schools are canceling for multiple days or even weeks at a time , often with little notice \u2014 forcing a significant hardship on working parents and causing students to fall further behind in their learning .\nThese teacher shortfalls are especially detrimental to the development of children in light of what they \u2019 ve already been experiencing since 2020 due to Covid responses .\nThe K-12 public education system started the 2021-2022 school year with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the previous year , and many more have withdrawn mid-year .\nEven with the resulting reduced demand for teachers , the supply has not kept pace .\nData from Emsi Burning Glass , revealing that job postings for teachers have grown by 79 percent over the past year , illustrates the magnitude of the teacher shortage .\nThe challenges are not new .\nRather , the past two years have accelerated what has long been a structural challenge within the K-12 education system for years \u2014 its inability to attract sufficient numbers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current system holds teacher certification as a sacred cow and fails to recognize subject matter expertise gained through advanced degrees , professional experience , or a combination of the two .\nInstead , a teaching certificate from any of the hundreds of programs around the country serves as the gatekeeper .\nLittle concern is given to the vastly differing quality or admissions requirements of the teacher preparation programs .\nNor is it considered that the instructors in the certification programs ( typically university professors ) are themselves often not certified .\nCertification requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnecessary barriers to entry and unnecessarily hinder the geographical movement of teachers .\nSince certifications vary state-to-state , many teachers feel constrained to stay put , even if they could find a better opportunity or quality of life in another state .\nResearchers have found that voluntary certification would provide at least as many benefits without the costs .\nWhile Governor Hochul \u2019 s announcement recognizes the long wait times in the certification process and endeavors to address it by hiring additional staff to facilitate teacher certification , the problem is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need is not more staff , but a different process for attracting , vetting , and retaining talent .\nUnfortunately , both the recruiting and the retaining of excellent teachers are hindered by a system that rewards tenure instead of performance .\nThe longstanding recognition in labor economics is that the alternative to longevity pay \u2014 pay for performance \u2014 creates stronger performance incentives for current workers .\nIt also attracts higher-caliber candidates because talented workers want a system that recognizes and rewards their performance .\nThe result of performance pay is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSimply raising salaries uniformly , as Governor Hochul has recommended , risks discouraging effort even more than it already is in the system .\nIn fact , the main problem in U.S. teacher pay is not low pay uniformly , but rather the lack of customization and failure to link pay with performance .\nA further issue is the nine-month work year .\nThough it may be attractive for some ( e.g.\n, working moms with younger children ) , it shortchanges those desiring compensation for a twelve-month professional employment career .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ workforce is the system \u2019 s overbearing bureaucracy , which dampens creativity and innovation , and snuffs out creative problem-solving .\nAll too often , the hands of teachers ( and administrators ) are tied by endless top-down , one-size-fits-all policies and procedures , preventing them from providing personalized learning plans for each individual student .\nGovernor Hochul \u2019 s recommendation to bring additional billions into the education system sounds good in theory , but does little to create incentives for performance .\nCustomization is increasingly needed , especially given the varying learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepare students for the increasingly complex workforce .\nTeachers \u2019 unions add to the bloated bureaucracy .\nDespite the extreme measures of teachers \u2019 unions to promote employee working conditions and compensation , research reveals that right-to-work laws positively affect workers , including their well-being .\nJob performance and job satisfaction are often higher among non-unionized teachers , such as those working in charter and private schools .\nFor example , data consistently confirms that charter school and private school students outperform traditional public school students .\nWith the teacher the number one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the powerful impact of the human capital in the classroom is revealed .\nAnd these charter and private school teachers willingly work for less pay with a mere fraction of the benefits traditional public school teachers receive , signaling strong job satisfaction .\nContinuing down the current path , which is failing our students and shuttering our schools , is unacceptable .\nWe need to stop throwing good money after bad and rethink K-12 education from a systems perspective .\nOf fundamental importance is getting incentives right .\nWith the teacher shortage crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to adjust the system .\nWe must attract the right teachers and reward them based on quality of work in order to deliver premium educational services to students .\nThe best way to do that is by linking pay with performance .\nWhile critics of pay for performance often argue that it harms students , empirical analysis has provided enormous evidence to the contrary .\nEven though performance pay has not been implemented on a large scale ( primarily due to teachers \u2019 unions \u2019 politicization of the issue ) , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example is the Dallas Independent School District , where the approach has led to substantial student learning gains .\nAnd no longer can we limit the educator pipeline to only graduates of education schools .\nThe pool of teacher candidates has dwindled , and schools are forced to hire less proficient teachers ( or sometimes the only applicant for a teaching vacancy ) , which ultimately hurts the student .\nFinally , we need to muster the political courage to challenge the unbridled power of the teachers \u2019 unions .\nTheir resistance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the lowest-performing teachers from getting fired keeps the U.S. K-12 education system in a state of mediocrity .\nThe system must be redesigned to address these flawed approaches and practices related to the acquisition and compensation of educators .\nThat means ending the teacher shortage and creating a system that allows and incentivizes our top subject matter experts and those with the ability to demonstrate remarkable teaching skills the opportunity to not only enter but have the necessary flexibility to transform our K-12 classrooms .", "author": "Keri D.

Administration\u2019s Plan to Destroy Medical Conscience is Un-American", "content": "Freedom of religion is fundamental to the American concept of ordered liberty .\nBut President Joe Biden doesn \u2019 t seem to care .\nIf news reports are right , his administration intends to force doctors and nurses to participate in abortions\u2014even when it violates their religious beliefs .\nIt plans to force Catholic hospitals to violate Church teachings by requiring them to provide sterilization and gender transition procedures , even on children .\nIn short , the Biden administration will coerce health care workers and institutions to adopt the values of secular woke culture in their professional lives .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ news sources , the Department of Health and Human Services will soon promulgate regulations obliterating the medical conscience protections put into place during the Trump administration , designed to protect doctors , nurses , pharmacists , and hospitals against being punished for refusing to participate in medical procedures that violate their moral or religious beliefs .\nThe Trump approach made eminent sense .\nToday \u2019 s society is morally polyglot\u2014and growing more so\u2014with resulting controversies roiling health care as they have other sectors of society .\nIn such a milieu , comity is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMedical conscience furthers this end by allowing patients to obtain legal , morally contentious procedures from willing professionals\u2014while also permitting dissenting medical professionals to stay true to their own beliefs and continue to serve patients and society .\nThe Trump medical conscience rule was already stricken by a court , and the Biden administration indicated to the Court of Appeals that it would not defend it .\nBut the absence of explicit conscience protections apparently isn \u2019 t enough for the cultural imperialists who now control the executive branch .\nThey and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parenthood , see the government \u2019 s substantial control of health care granted by the Affordable Care Act , Medicare , Medicaid , and other such programs , as their vehicle to push through woke social change that they might not be able to achieve through democratic means .\nThat \u2019 s hardly democratic .\nMoreover\u2014as with many other Biden policies\u2014eviscerating medical conscience would not only be explosively contentious , but profoundly unwise : \u2022 Compelling doctors to violate their faith beliefs will sow noxious seeds of national disunity that already dangerously divide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politically conservative from the liberal .\nAt the very least , watching doctors punished for refusing to act against their own religious precepts will convince people of faith that their own government regards them as cultural enemies .\n\u2022 The rule will further erode liberty and add to the creeping authoritarianism afflicting our society .\nIf freedom of religion can be pushed aside by government fiat even though it \u2019 s expressly protected in the Bill of Rights , so can other fundamental freedoms .\n\u2022 The rule will lead to years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act\u2014enacted in 1993 to protect against this exact kind of overreach by the federal government .\nAnd once again , the Supreme Court will be dragged into raw partisan politics to its substantial detriment .\n\u2022 There could be a significant \u201c brain drain \u201d from the medical professions .\nIf we force health care professionals to violate their moral beliefs , some older doctors and nurses will retire , taking their experience and knowledge with them .\nTalented young people who would make splendid doctors , nurses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether .\nIn a time of strained medical resources , we would all be the losers in that .\n\u2022 Forcing medical professionals to participate in legal but morally contentious procedures could be bad for patient outcomes .\nFor example , it \u2019 s not a medical given that blocking puberty for children diagnosed with gender dysphoria serves these patients \u2019 best interests , even though the Biden administration has adopted the ideology of the transgender movement as official government policy .\nPuberty blocking has been all but banned in Finland and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most recently , France \u2019 s National Academy of Medicine published an urgent warning ( pdf ) against routinely subjecting children diagnosed with gender dysphoria to mutilating surgeries and the impeding of normal maturation .\nNor would the coercion necessarily stop with abortion and transgender transitions .\nThe areas of moral contention in medicine will only intensify in coming years .\nAs just a few examples : Some bioethicists are lobbying for laws that would give dementia patients the right to sign advance directives instructing nursing homes to withhold sustenance once they reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If these acts become legal\u2014and if there \u2019 s no right to say no because medical conscience has been obliterated\u2014doctors and nurses who practice in this field could be forced to participate in the starving of their own patients .\nWithout medical conscience rights , if genetically engineering embryos becomes a normal part of reproductive medicine , doctors could be forced to participate in blatant acts of eugenics .\nOr , if assisted suicide becomes ubiquitous and considered a human right\u2014which is the direction in which society is moving\u2014doctors might be forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t shake your head and roll your eyes .\nAll doctors in Ontario , Canada , must either kill legally qualified patients who ask for euthanasia\u2014or find a doctor for the patient who they know will give a lethal injection .\nThis much is sure .\nThe stakes in the medical conscience controversy are very high .\nAs the \u201c Declaration in Support of Conscientious Objection in Health Care \u201d puts it : \u201c If health care workers are not to be reduced to mere functionaries ( of the state , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they must be free to exercise their professional judgment

believe that in his mind , his comments don \u2019 t match up with the current reality of our public school classrooms today .\nOver the last two years , the COVID-19 pandemic with its resulting lockdowns and school closures has blown the lid off the inner workings of America \u2019 s public school classrooms .\nParents have gotten a firsthand look at how divisive ideologies like critical race theory and gender identity are entering school curricula , libraries , and policies .\nNot only are kids collectively falling behind in academics right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being distracted by harmful ideas that confuse , segregate , and shame instead of unite .\nIn a national wave of righteous anger , parents began pushing back against this trend , prompting a backlash from some political and educational leaders who would prefer parents stayed out of public school affairs .\nIn testimony to the Senate in September last year , Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said that parents of school-age children should not act as the \u201c primary stakeholders \u201d in education decisions .\nThat same month , National School Boards Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White House accusing upset parents of engaging in \u201c a form of domestic terrorism.\n\u201d And in the run-up to his failed bid for reelection last November , Former Virginia Gov .\nTerry McAuliffe said , \u201c I don \u2019 t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.\n\u201d The message from these public figures is clear : parents should butt out of their kids \u2019 education and leave it to the professionals .\nBut just whose kids are they anyway ?\nAs writer Helen Roy puts it \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their parents , and that parents are the best guarantors of their children \u2019 s health and happiness \u201d \u2014 should go without saying .\nAs such , parents are the primary educators of their children .\nThey have the ultimate right to decide who partners with them to teach their kids as well as supervise what and how their kids learn .\nThey also have ultimate authority to teach their kids about sexuality .\nBut a number of recent news stories have exposed schools and teachers who think they know better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids .\nIn California , two middle school teachers secretly manipulated an 11-year-old girl into believing she was a transgender boy while keeping her mother in the dark .\nAlso in California , parents have been told repeatedly that critical race theory is not being taught in schools , yet a video has surfaced that shows school advisers discussing how to get around the CRT label and still teach the concepts .\nA school district in Wisconsin is training school staff that \u201c parents are not entitled to know their kids \u2019 identities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be earned.\n\u201d So what is the appropriate role for teachers in public schools ?\nIronically , in the same speech to teachers , Biden admitted that \u201c the greatest sin that anyone can commit is the abuse of power.\n\u201d Yet , that \u2019 s what we \u2019 re seeing in classrooms across America \u2014 teachers who are abusing the trust placed in them by parents and students in the name of personal propaganda .\nTo be effective as a teacher , four qualities must be evident .\nFirst , a healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teachers serve the community , which includes the parents of the students they teach .\nAs Carol Garhart Mooney notes in her book Theories of Childhood : \u201c The values and cultures of families and communities should be reflected in and deepened by what happens at school.\n\u201d But if the values of the teacher or school administrators are vastly different than the values of parents at home , that \u2019 s a fundamental problem .\nSecond , modesty is essential .\nAs teachers guide students to learning , it \u2019 s not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about them , least of all their sexual or political persuasions .\nModest teachers will demonstrate self-restraint and wisdom in the sharing of personal information or opinions .\nThird , a spirit of gratefulness is required to teach well .\nIt is hard to be pessimistic about America \u2019 s past or future when teachers practice gratefulness .\nDwelling on what isn \u2019 t good about life or society will not promote a grateful tone in teachers or students .\nFinally , truth should be the goal of any humble , modest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindling a hunger for the quest for truth are the ways we equip the next generation to form sound judgments .\nBiden \u2019 s effort to share his immense respect for teachers and encourage today \u2019 s overwhelmed and overstressed educators is not without merit .\nBut his admission that the students in classrooms are not somebody else \u2019 s children undermines parental rights and gives continued license to activist teachers and administrators who sacrifice critical thinking and free inquiry for indoctrination and intolerance .", "author": "Andrew McDiarmid", "url":

Wade could soon be overturned\u2014irrationally claim that returning abortion policy to the democratic realm would be \u201c anti-democratic.\n\u201d The feminist pundit Jill Filipovic set the tone when she railed in The Guardian that the prospect of \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US is the outcome of years of anti-democratic organizing , \u201d and nothing less than \u201c a sign of democracy in decline.\n\u201d What hysterical nonsense .\nOverturning Roe\u2014still far from certain , as the leaked early draft opinion that caused the left \u2019 s explosion of hysteria will not be the ultimate ruling\u2014would not , in and of itself , make abortion illegal anywhere in the country .\nRather , abortion public policy would merely be returned to the states where it existed before Roe became the law of the land .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ significantly weakened , it will be precisely because pro-life citizens tirelessly dedicated themselves for decades to applying the tools of democracy to reverse what they consider to be a profoundly unjust imposition by the Supreme Court of an immoral public policy that led to the deaths of more than 63 million unborn babies .\nIn what many considered a hopeless cause , the pro-lifers organized , petitioned their government for redress , educated , agitated , and protested against the abortion regime .\nIndeed , the massive annual March for Life demonstrations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protests in American history Pro-lifers also willingly accepted the scorn of the media , popular culture , and many politicians in the greater cause of saving unborn lives .\nA minority of pro-lifers were so committed to the cause that they resorted to peaceful civil disobedience\u2014a venerable American tradition\u2014accepting punishment under the law to highlight what they considered a profound injustice .\nDespite the profound emotionality of the issue , almost all pro-lifers rejected violence\u2014and the few terrible murders committed by anti-abortion fanatics were roundly denounced by movement leaders and rank and file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of electoral politics , both running for office and supporting like-minded candidates with their time , money , and votes .\nThey experienced frustration after frustration , reverse after reverse , failure after failure , defeat snatched by courts after democratic victories .\nBut they never gave up .\nThe movement became a potent political force because it could turn out voters .\nPro-life concentrated political engagement became focused within the Republican Party , and ever so slowly , the worm began to turn .\nLike-minded candidates were elected to offices high and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state officials , as well as to Congress and sometimes , the presidency .\nThe movement achieved incremental successes , such as the federal ban on partial birth abortion .\nMore to the point of the current moment , the makeup of the Supreme Court shifted to the right increasing the likelihood that Roe might one day be reversed\u2014an unlikely but by no means , unprecedented , event .\nIn contrast , Roe v. Wade was itself an egregious usurpation of democracy .\nFirst , the case was based on a blatant lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCorvey\u2014the \u201c Roe \u201d in the decision\u2014had been raped and had sought an illegal abortion .\nNot only was that not true\u2014she became pregnant in a consensual relationship\u2014but she also gave birth .\nBeyond that , the petitioners in Roe never asked the court to invalidate all state legal prohibitions .\nMaking abortion an almost absolute constitutional right was the idea of the seven Justices who signed the majority opinion , an act that Associate Justice Byron White , writing in dissent , properly called \u201c an exercise of raw judicial power.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vigorous democratic debate then ongoing about whether terminations should be legal , and if so , in what contexts .\nIndeed , at the time of the decision , a few states , such as New York , had already legalized abortion through democratic processes .\nOthers had rejected legalization outright .\nFor example , mere months before the decision was released , Michigan voters rejected a referendum to legalize abortion by more than 60 percent .\nIn the end , Roe v. Wade was a profound disservice to the country .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the majority Justices naively expected , their judicial imperialism became the genesis of the bitter cultural dislocations that have so badly strained our bonds of mutual affection .\nRather than achieving political equipoise as usually happens when contentious issues are resolved democratically , at least in part because of Roe , Americans are now more bitterly divided over fundamental moral values than at any time since the Civil War .\nAnd here \u2019 s the thing : If Roe v. Wade is overturned , abortion will not be outlawed .\nRather , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sphere where it belongs .\nSome states will outlaw it altogether .\nOthers will allow more restrictions than permitted now .\nSome will expand abortion access through the ninth month , paid for by the government .\nBoth sides will strive to enact national laws liberalizing or restricting access at the federal level .\nFrankly , it will get very ugly .\nBut over time , if democracy is allowed to work its wonders , whatever the outcome , at least public policy will be more likely to reflect the views of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these policies will always be subject to change if those popular views shift .\nIn bringing the country to this portentous moment , the pro-life movement acted in the grand tradition of social activism that has been a hallmark of the American experience .\nLike the abolitionists , anti-child labor campaigners , the civil rights movement , women \u2019 s suffrage , the temperance movement , feminism , gay rights , labor union organizing , etc.\u2014pro-lifers proved that in a democracy , average people acting together in a determined cause can change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there \u2019 s no such thing as a hopeless cause .", "author": "Wesley J.

@ @ @ @ @ @ comic book .\nHe is best remembered in Avengers : Infinity War , \u201c It \u2019 s a simple calculus .\nThis universe is finite , its resources finite .\nIf life is left unchecked , life will cease to exist .\nIt needs correction.\n\u201d He then proceeded to wipe out half of all life , devastating civilization .\nYellen further noted that \u201c denying women access to abortion increased their odds of living in poverty or need for public assistance , \u201d likely a reference to a September 2021 amicus brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThese economists have done a pretty good job identifying the costs associated with having children , which is no surprise .\nKids always cost money , at least until they \u2019 re in their 20s .\nWhat the \u201c prominent \u201d economists failed to do was to also recognize the benefits .\nConsequently , their report only covers 50 percent of the assignment .\nThey would get a D- in Econ 101 for this paper .\nIt \u2019 s the mistake the great 18th century French economist Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat , best known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about in his first chapter , \u201c That Which is Seen , and that Which is Not Seen.\n\u201d In the department of economy , an act , a habit , an institution , a law , gives birth not only to an effect , but to a series of effects .\nOf these effects , the first only is immediate ; it manifests itself simultaneously with its cause\u2014it is seen .\nThe others unfold in succession\u2014they are not seen : it is well for us , if they are foreseen .\nBetween @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutes the whole difference\u2014the one takes account of the visible effect ; the other takes account both of the effects which are seen , and also of those which it is necessary to foresee .\nThe Wall Street Journal also notes that Ms. Yellen \u201c overlooks the lost productive contribution of children who were never born .\nPeople are assets , the source of inventions and new businesses .\nHuman capital is crucial to economic growth and a dynamic society.\n\u201d The brilliant economist Julian Simon couldn \u2019 t agree more .\nHow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 63 million more Americans ?\nOne way would be to look at the relationship between growth in population and growth in GDP per capita .\nFrom 1972 to 2021 U.S. population increased by 123 million from 209 million to 332 million .\nDuring this same period real GDP per capita increased by $ 38,861 from $ 30,360 to $ 69,221 .\nReal GDP per capita increased by $ 316 for every additional one million people ( $ 38,861 \u00f7 123 ) .\nAdding these 63 million missing persons at $ 316 per million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 20,000 higher at $ 89,125 .\nU.S. population grew at compound annual rate of around 0.95 percent from 1972 to 2021 .\nContrast this to the 1.5 percent rate from 1950 to 1972 .\nAdding an additional 63 million over the last 50 years would put us at 395 million today instead of 332 million , giving us a manageable annual growth rate of 1.31 percent .\nAnother important consideration is total GDP .\nIf GDP per capita was $ 20,000 higher and we had 63 million more people , our total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over $ 12 trillion ( 52 percent ) higher that our actual GDP of $ 23 trillion .\nSo who are these 63 million missing people ?\nJulian Simon provides a clue .\nOne spring day in 1969 he experienced an epiphany .\nHe writes that : I visited the U.S. AID office on the outskirts of Washington , D.C. , to discuss a project intended to lower fertility in less-developed countries .\nI arrived early for my appointment , so I strolled outside in the warm sunshine .\nBelow the building \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that said \u201c Iwo Jima Memorial.\n\u201d There came to me the memory of reading a eulogy delivered by a Jewish chaplain over the dead on the battlefield at Iwo Jima , saying something like , \u201c How many who would have been a Mozart or a Michelangelo or an Einstein have we buried here ?\n\u201d And then I thought , Have I gone crazy ?\nWhat business do I have trying to help arrange it that fewer human beings will be born , each one of whom might be a Mozart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a joy to his or her family and community , and a person who will enjoy life ?\nElon Musk and Julian Simon are right .\nJanet Yellen and Thanos are wrong .\nMore human beings create much more wealth for all of us to enjoy , if given the freedom to innovate by learning and discovering new valuable knowledge to share in free markets .\nInvest in people .\nWe pay the highest dividends .\nYou can learn more about these economic facts and ideas in our forthcoming book , Superabundance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gilder calls it a \u201c supremely contrarian book \u201d which overturns \u201c the tables in the temple of conventional thinking \u201d by deploying \u201c rigorous and original data and analysis to proclaim a gospel of abundance .\nEconomics\u2014and ultimately , politics\u2014will be enduringly transformed .\n\u201d", "author": "Gale

matter of logic and intuition , the widespread legalization of assisted suicide will increase both the rate of assisted suicides and the rate of unassisted suicides .\nAfter all , many people conflate what is \u201c legal \u201d with what is \u201c right.\n\u201d Once a state gives its imprimatur to assisted suicide as a way of alleviating suffering and providing \u201c medical aid in dying , \u201d as it is euphemistically called , an ever-increasing number of people will resort to that means of ending their lives .\nAnd indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where assisted suicide is legal , both assisted suicides and unassisted suicides increase .\nAdvocates of assisted suicide disagree , of course .\nOne argument\u2014which the media often parrots\u2014holds that people with suicidal ideation not caused by terminal illness are unlikely to be influenced by legalization of assisted suicide because \u201c medical aid in dying \u201d is a treatment and not \u201c suicide.\n\u201d This argument has never rung true for me .\nThat is simply not how the human mind works , particularly when we are in extremis .\nIt has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to think that society \u2019 s approval of suicides for the terminally ill also applies to them , even if the cause of their existential crisis and misery falls outside the current parameters of legalization .\nEven though overall suicide rates have risen considerably throughout the West in recent years , few studies have been conducted to determine whether the legalization of assisted suicide has had any effect on this concerning trend .\nThat is slowly beginning to change .\nIn 2015 , a study published in the Southern Medical Law Journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assisted suicide was legal ( Oregon , Washington , Vermont , and Montana , where legality remains a matter of dispute ) .\nThe authors reported that \u201c PAS [ physician-assisted suicide ] is associated with an 8.9 % increase in total suicide rates \u201d ( including assisted suicides ) , and when \u201c state-speci\ufb01c time trends \u201d are included , \u201c the estimated increase is 6.3 % .\n\u201d The authors concluded : \u201c The introduction of PAS seemingly induces more self-in\ufb02icted deaths than it inhibits.\n\u201d This report , as is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and criticized in a responsive paper published in 2017 in Journal of Ethics in Mental Health ( JEMH ) .\nWhile the critics recognized some strengths in the earlier study , they noted that suicide rates in Washington and Montana had been increasing before legalization , that the work exhibited \u201c methodological weaknesses \u201d ( such as not taking trends in nations such as the Netherlands and Belgium into account ) , and that \u201c association does not prove causation.\n\u201d Still , even these critics did not contend that legalizing assisted suicide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nRather , they argued that much more research needed to be conducted \u201c before definitive claims about the effects of legalization of medical assistance in dying on non-assisted suicide can be made.\n\u201d Earlier this year , the original authors responded to this criticism in the JEMH .\nThis time , they compared suicide rates in European countries that had legalized euthanasia with demographically similar countries that had not .\nAgain , the authors found a \u201c concerning pattern \u201d where EAS ( euthanasia/assisted suicide ) is legal .\nThey found , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the four jurisdictions they studied in which euthanasia and assisted suicide ( EAS ) are legal , \u201c there have been very steep rises in suicide.\n\u201d Moreover , \u201c In none of the four jurisdictions did non-assisted suicide rates decrease after introduction of EAS.\n\u201d In the Netherlands\u2014which has recorded the highest number of deaths by EAS , \u201c the rates of non-assisted suicide \u201d increased since legalization .\nEven in Belgium , where \u201c non-assisted suicide decreased in absolute terms , they increased relative to its most similar non EAS neighbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just released also showing an increase in suicide rates associated with assisted suicide legalization , with a particularly adverse effect on women .\nTwo professors , writing for the Centre for Economics Policy Research ( CEPR ) , tested the hypothesis that legalizing assisted suicide would actually reduce suicide rates , and countered with their own hypothesis that doing so would \u201c not only reduce practical barriers to committing suicide but may also lower societal taboos against suicide , \u201d leading to \u201c an increase of suicide rates overall.\n\u201d After reviewing data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicide as of 2019 , and referencing the studies described above , the authors concluded : And what about the unassisted suicides in that increase in total suicides ?\nWhat are we to make of all of this ?\nThere is evidence that suggests suicide begets suicide , and that legal assisted suicide has an effect on suicide rates overall .\nObviously , we need to undertake more empirical studies and pointed analyses , but if we care as a society about preventing suicides generally\u2014regardless of our beliefs about assisted suicide for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contagion should become a pressing concern in fashioning public policy .\nBefore any more states legalize doctor-assisted death , policymakers and the public should focus much more closely on this little-considered aspect of the debate .\nHuman lives literally are at stake .", "author":

forward proves otherwise with many of the efforts focusing on increasing support for mothers and families not just during pregnancy but well after a child is born .\nThe expanded resources for mothers

the health and safety of both mothers and children .\nOther common types of pro-life bills and provisions introduced include bills advancing abortion prohibitions at various gestational limits , informed consent , regulation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prohibiting taxpayer funding of abortion , regulating dangerous chemical abortions , protecting born-alive abortion survivors , ultrasound requirements , and prohibiting non-physician abortions .\nArizona , Florida , and Kentucky implemented a ban on abortions after 15 weeks \u2019 gestation , a point at which science shows that the preborn child can feel pain .\nIncluded in Florida \u2019 s and Kentucky \u2019 s bills that were enacted was a requirement that the abortionist report if an abortion was due to human trafficking or coercion .\nIn addition to reporting such abortions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women who are victims of this abuse .\nThese types of bills may sadly become more necessary as we foresee trafficking and coercion skyrocket in states that will become abortion hubs in a post-Roe era .\nKentucky also took steps to protect minors , requiring parental consent for abortions on girls under 18 .\nWest Virginia worked to protect the most vulnerable preborn children , those believed to have a disability , prohibiting abortionists from committing an abortion for eugenic reasons .\nChemical abortions were addressed by Florida , Kentucky , and South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to regulate these risky procedures through provisions such as prohibiting dispensation of such an abortion via telemedicine and limiting the procedure to nine weeks post-fertilization .\nPenalties were also increased for the unlicensed practice of medicine when committing a chemical abortion .\nWhile some laws regulated abortion procedures , others enacted

water and bleach while evading police .\nIt didn \u2019 t have to happen .\nSeattle \u2019 s approach to homelessness is not compassionate .\nYes , the goal is to keep addicts alive , but helping them shoot up is not dignified .\nAllowing people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tents on sidewalks is not humane .\nAnd leaving without proper treatment those haunted by mental illness is not civilized .\nWorse yet , this misguided approach endangers those suffering and the public at large .\nMeanwhile , many businesses that are already struggling through the pandemic still contend with the burden of the rampant crime

this region , a lack of funding is not the problem .\nKing County \u2019 s own surveys demonstrate this fact .\nFewer than 10 % of those experiencing homelessness say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase is the root cause of their predicament .\nInstead \u2014 as even casual observers know \u2014 it is primarily a crisis of addiction and mental illness .\nIt \u2019 s time to redirect the funding already

from the open southern border , the high cost of fuel from the willful shutting down of domestic energy production , the disgraceful and hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan that unnecessarily cost American lives and surrendered some $ 80 billion in U.S. military equipment , and out-of-control federal deficit spending , debt growth and economic mismanagement resulting in high inflation and

Assembly led by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) will be convening in Geneva , to vote on amendments formulated by the Biden administration that would transfer the sovereignty of key functions of America \u2019 s health care administration to the WHO .\nThese proposed amendments were developed by Biden administration officials during the first year in office , and they were quietly sent to the WHO on January 18 , 2022 , without an official statement or a single press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these critical developments .\nAnd now in a few days they will be voted on .\nShould these amendments get adopted they would empower the WHO to unilaterally intervene in the affairs of any nation , including the U.S. , that is merely suspected of having a \u201c health emergency \u201d of concern to other nations .\nThe Biden amendments eliminate the prior restrictive language in place from the inception of the WHO in 1948 that specifically limited the U.N. agency \u2019 s role to a consultative one and required consent from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adoption of outside recommendations .\nIf these amendments are approved , the WHO would have the power to declare an \u201c international health emergency , \u201d nullifying the sovereign powers of nation states , which is a key objective of the World Economic Forum .\nThe WHO could then declare health emergencies at will and impose mandates that could justify ostracism of some countries or impose financial and economic restrictions \u2014 like lockdowns and business closures \u2014 on any country with an alleged public health problem .\nWe can also get some idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote gives the WHO new sovereign powers in health care policy in the United States by looking at Director General Tedros \u2019 s background .\nAs Minister of Foreign Affairs in Ethiopia from 2012 to 2016 , Tedros oversaw huge Chinese investment in Ethiopia , including a $ 200 million office building project and eight industrial parks , all of which suggest that

was Tedros who covered up for China in 2019 and 2020 , backing its clams of transparency regarding the first Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan , China , when in fact there was evidence to the contrary .\nChina had in fact suppressed information that could have saved many lives .\nIn earlier times any notion of U.N. interference with the sovereignty and independence of the United States would be unacceptable because most understood that the U.S. Constitution not the United Nations was the controlling authority .\nBut such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last 15 years government officials , operatives and activists largely associated with the Democratic Party have gotten away with initiatives involving conflicted interests and running roughshod over the U.S. Constitution with no consequences .\nRemember Hillary Clinton \u2019 s simultaneous involvement in fundraising for the private Clinton Foundation from many of the foreign governments with whom she was engaged in her official capacity as secretary of state .\nThen there was the secret negotiation and implementation of the Obama-Biden administration \u2019 s Iran nuclear deal of 2015 that circumvented the treaty-making provisions of

lines on what is permissible in rules , protocols , and laws regarding international relations .\nWe can all now see that misguided COVID-19 pandemic lockdown policies were a chief contributing factor to supply chain disruptions , economic dislocations , and our current inflationary environment .\nSo , it is imperative that the American people stop the expanded empowerment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legitimacy .\nWe can do that by demanding that any such change in our relationship with the WHO be governed by the international treaty-making power defined in Article II , Section 2 of the

came to be recognized as the most hallowed grave at Arlington Cemetery\u2014the most sacred military cemetery in the United States .\nHere , one of the profound ironies of our history is that this hallowed and sacred ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee , who despite his defeat in leading the Confederate cause in the Civil War ended up with the highest unspoken national honor .\nThat honor unexpectedly came from the great loss of giving up his family \u2019 s Arlington House plantation , which he and his wife forfeited to the federal government after they sided with Virginia and the South .\nThe 1,100 acres of that seized plantation land would later become the Arlington Cemetery\u2014the most hallowed ground in America\u2014providing a final resting place for future patriots who gave their lives for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ republic .\nThe selection process for the World War II Unknown proved more difficult than that of World War I since American soldiers had fought on three continents .\nThen the process was interrupted by the Korean War , which resulted in numerous dead who could not be identified .\nFinally on May 28 , 1958 , caskets bearing the Unknowns of World War II and the Korean War arrived in Washington .\nThe caskets were rotated such that each unknown serviceman rested on the \u201c Lincoln catafalque , \u201d a raised platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in April 1865 .\nTwo days later on May 30 , then the official date of Memorial Day , those Unknowns were transported to Arlington Cemetery , where they were interred in the plaza beside their World War I comrades .\nWith so many \u201c missing in action \u201d in the Vietnam War , it was decided that the crypt designated Unknown for that war would remain empty .\nIt was rededicated to honor all missing U.S. service members from the Vietnam War on September 17 , 1999 , with the inscription on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keeping the Faith with America \u2019 s Missing Servicemen , 1958-1975.\n\u201d The inscribed words on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier of \u201c Here Rests in Honored Glory an American Soldier Known but to God \u201d are an uplifting reminder that all those who died for the American cause should have a special place in our hearts as they do in God \u2019 s .\nThe tomb is guarded 24 hours a day , 365 days a year regardless of weather by special armed Tomb Guard sentinels .\nAnyone who visits the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but be humbled and even tearfully reminded of what Lincoln said at Gettysburg , \u201c that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion\u2014that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain\u2014that this nation , under God , shall have a new birth of freedom\u2014and that government of the people , by the people , for the people , shall not perish from the earth.\n\u201d Memorial Day reminds us that U.S. military personnel are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line .\nDefending the nation and fighting wars is the most serious and important job of all .\nThere should be no acceptance of political and military leadership ineptitude , such as what led up to throwing away a long and hard-fought victory in Iraq by withdrawing all U.S. forces in 2011\u2014enabling the rise of ISIS ; or what led up to the hasty retreat from Afghanistan in August 2021 , which unnecessarily cost 13 American soldiers and left behind some $ 80 billion of U.S. military equipment in what was effectively a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there should be zero tolerance for policies or programs that divide and demoralize our troops such as critical race theory indoctrination , which has been the willful policy choice of Joe Biden \u2019 s secretary of defense and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .\nIn sum , this year\u20142022\u2014Memorial Day takes on a greater two-fold meaning than it has previously .\nWe are called to remember those who died in military service to the country and recommit to the conviction that those lives lost shall never be in vain .\nEqually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our appreciation of a heritage that began with a courageous , brilliant , and faithful group of founders and those that followed who were willing to give their lives to establish , preserve and protect the United States and what it stands for .\nWhile many of us now feel that the light from the City on a Hill has grown dim , our Constitution still stands , and we the people are still in charge .\nIn the face of internal and external enemies seeking our demise , we can not falter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do .\nLet us go forward with the biblical admonition that \u201c if my people , who are called by my name , will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways , then I will\u2026forgive their sin and will heal their land

goes without saying that high divorce rates , abortion and broken homes are correlated to the moral breakdown associated with sexual revolution of the latter 1960s .\nWhat also followed was a decline of discipline at home and in school .\nThe moral relativism of \u201c if it feels good , do it \u201d that was popularized at that time became a cultural wrecking ball in subsequent

"discoveryinstitute", "title": "Why Happy the Elephant Should Not Have Rights", "content": "The media have finally awakened to an important case pending before the New York Court of Appeals \u2014 that state \u2019 s highest court \u2014 that could upend the moral relationship between humans and animals .\nIndeed , if the plaintiffs prevail , an elephant named Happy will be declared to be a \u201c who \u201d \u2014 instead of a \u201c what \u201d \u2014 and found to be entitled to the same \u201c rights \u201d as any human being .\nThe litigation involves an Asian elephant that has resided at the Bronx Zoo for more than 40 years .\nAn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Project , sued for a writ of habeas corpus \u2014 listing Happy as a litigant \u2014 on the basis that she is an autonomous and cognitively complex \u201c person \u201d entitled to bodily liberty and that her confinement is legally wrong .\nIn a saner time , the claim would have been laughed out of court .\nAfter all , even if the NonHuman Rights Project prevails , Happy will not be free .\nRather , she will be relocated to an elephant sanctuary chosen by the plaintiffs .\nIn other words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will remain entirely under human control .\nBut Happy is not the actual subject of this lawsuit .\nAs in other , similar , but unsuccessful cases brought by animal-rights ideologues involving chimps and captive orcas , her well-being is merely the pretext .\nThe real purpose of the lawsuit is to harness the intense emotions people feel for elephants \u2014 which are indeed magnificent creatures \u2014 to catapult a major animal-rights agenda known as \u201c animal standing \u201d into law .\nHow \u201c Animal Standing \u201d Would Further Animal-Rights Ideology It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not seek to improve techniques of animal husbandry .\nThat approach \u2014 known as \u201c animal welfare \u201d \u2014 is opposed by animal-rights activists because it presumes humans can own animals .\nAnimal-rights ideology denies that people have the right to use animals for any purpose , no matter how beneficial to us .\nIn other words , the movement \u2019 s ultimate desire is to end all animal domestication .\nAnimal standing would further this goal by allowing animals to bring lawsuits against their owners .\nOnce again , as with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept is a sham .\nThe animal \u201c litigants \u201d would be oblivious to their cases , just as Happy is to the one involving her .\nBut the legal fiction of animals suing would empower animal-rights ideologues to use the courts as a cudgel to subvert animal-using industries and institutions .\nWhat would more readily further that long-term goal than allowing animals to sue their owners ?\nImagine the chaos that court rulings allowing animal standing could unleash : hundreds of animal lawyers , filing thousands of lawsuits , forcing industries to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyers and legal costs defending their husbandry .\nNo animal industry would be safe .\nIn other words , granting personhood to Happy would be the first step in a long march aimed at opening courtrooms to all owned animals .\nThese cases would start with what we once called \u201c higher mammals , \u201d such as chimps , apes , dolphins , dogs , pigs , and elephants .\nBut they would eventually spread to all domesticated animals .\nYou see , the movement \u2019 s ideology does not view the philosophical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cognitive capacities as the proper basis for granting \u201c rights.\n\u201d Rather , animal-rights ideology holds that rights flow from the ability to feel pain , a concept known as \u201c painience \u201d in the movement \u2019 s lexicon .\nIn this view , since humans and animals alike feel pain , we and they are moral equals \u2014 or as the head of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals , Ingrid Newkirk , told Vogue in 1989 , \u201c There is no rational basis for asserting that a human being has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pig is a dog is a boy.\n\u201d Moreover , animal rightists believe that what we do to animals should be viewed as if the same action were done to a human being .\nThus , since cattle can feel pain , animal rightists believe that ranching is the tantamount to slaveholding and eating steak the moral equivalent of Auschwitz \u2014 an odious comparison PETA once made explicitly in its infamous \u201c Holocaust on Your Plate \u201d campaign .\nFurthering this misanthropy , rather than ensuring Happy \u2019 s proper care , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have her declared a free and autonomous person .\nThat is why it is essential that Happy not be granted rights .\nFirst , such a ruling would indeed \u201c break the species barrier \u201d \u2014 as the NonHuman Rights Project intends \u2014 blurring the moral distinction between humans and animals .\nSecond , it would accomplish a major animal-rights goal of undermining the status of animals as property .\nOn an existential level , the perceived exceptional nature of human beings would suffer a body blow .\nIf we come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forest , that is precisely how we will act .\nAnd finally , it would dilute the meaning and importance of \u201c rights.\n\u201d If animals are coequal with humans , the concept of \u201c rights \u201d itself would be cheapened in the same way that inflation devalues currency .\nNot only that , but granting animals rights would add to the surreality of the times in which we live .\nUnder an animal-rights paradigm , humans could not assert any rights against an animal \u2014 nor , obviously , would animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , we would have rights only in relationship to other humans , but animals would have rights against us \u2014 except that the animals \u2019 claims would be enforced only by people acting on behalf of the animals , who would have no idea what was going on .\nIt is enough to make one dizzy .\nThus , when we get to the nub of the matter , animal welfare versus animal rights isn \u2019 t about \u201c rights \u201d at all .\nRather , it a debate about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our duties toward animals \u2014 obligations , it is important to add , that are predicated solely on our being human .\nIn this sense , the animal-rights controversy itself is ironic proof of human exceptionalism .\nAs moral beings , we should be held to account for how we treat animals , but as amoral beings , they are not responsible for any of their actions , no matter how brutal .\nSo let us hope the seven judges of the court resist the temptation to \u201c make history.\n\u201d Promoting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble cause , but that is not what the legal effort to have Happy declared a \u201c person \u201d is ultimately all about .", "author": "Wesley J.

we should be both generous and discerning .\nIf we only provide material help in a way that enables addiction and overlooks mental illness , our generosity may be selfishness that gives ourselves a warm glow but hurts others .\nWe can learn from the oldest charity still existing in the United States , the Scots \u2019 Charitable Society of Boston , founded in 1657 .\nThe Society from its start resolved to \u201c open the bowells of our compassion \u201d without catering to the \u201c openly scandalous.\n\u201d It viewed poor people as able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in God \u2019 s image and aimed to live accordingly , but likely to descend into despair if they started to see themselves as animals .\nBoston minister Cotton Mather in 1698 asked his church members to be charitable but also careful not to \u201c abuse your charity by misapplying it.\n\u201d He added , \u201c If there be any base house , which threaten debauch and poison and confound the neighborhood \u201d \u2014 today we might

\u201c who might earn and eat their own Bread , if they did not shamefully idle away their Time.\n\u201d We tend to think of generosity as the opposite of selfishness , but it \u2019 s more helpful to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle .\nThe selfishness of not giving is at one end .\nThe selfishness of giving that warms the giver \u2019 s heart but hurts the recipient is at the other .\nJesus \u2019 parable in Matthew 25 emphasizes that \u201c as much as you did to the least of these , you did to Me.\n\u201d That cuts both ways : A person who offers help is helping Jesus , but a person who gives money that goes for drugs is shooting heroin into Jesus \u2019 veins .\nTwo centuries ago Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some 23 Boston charity societies declared in 1835 that to give to the poor in \u201c a way to supersede the necessity of industry , of forethought , and of proper self-restraint and self-denial , is at once to do wrong , and to encourage the receivers of our alms to wrong doing.\n\u201d Similarly , the Boston Provident Association ( established in 1851 ) gave food , clothes , and coal to those willing to work but in temporary need .\nThe association refused requests from drunkards and asked supporters to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit to the Association \u2019 s offices , where volunteers would examine needs , make job referrals , and provide food and temporary shelter .\nIt also developed a list that in 1853 contained 201 names of \u201c impostors \u201d \u2014 able-bodied persons who refused to work .\nCharitable organizations did not pretend to know the character of

homeschooling to create a new vision for what education can and should be .\nFor anyone currently homeschooling , considering it , or even contesting it , this film is worth watching .\nAnd it \u2019 s not just for parents .\nStudents , grandparents , and anyone interested in the field of education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society thrive should make plans to see this film .\nAs portrayed in the film , many parents have doubt about their abilities : \u201c What if I get it wrong ?\n\u201d \u201c I \u2019 m not trained as an educator.\n\u201d For others , there are misconceptions and stereotypes about homeschooling : \u201c I can \u2019 t homeschool because I \u2019 d have to be home all of the time , and I couldn \u2019 t work , and there \u2019 d be no flexibility.\n\u201d \u201c I kind of thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you made your bread from scratch.\n\u201d For still others , there \u2019 s an honest reflection about alternative priorities : \u201c Homeschool was not on my radar .\nThere were a lot of things I enjoyed doing while my kids were at school.\n\u201d As the film gets underway , a dad asks : \u201c Isn \u2019 t homeschooling like public schools at home ?\n\u201d

than anyone else , and you love your children more than anyone else .\nYou will be an excellent teacher .\nOne of the greatest advantages of homeschooling is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourages parents to consider this alternative to traditional public education by offering insights from parents who have participated in homeschooling .\nThis includes practical advice \u2014 one homeschool mom

create a flexible schedule that works for their family .\nSecond , they need to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThird , they should a make a plan for developing a homeschool community .\nIn other words , structure , learning modes , and community are foundational before picking a curriculum .\nInstead of leading with content , homeschool parents should first seek to create an environment and learning

Wade was not only the primary motive for the failed Kavanaugh assassination attempt , but also in the wake of its publishing , pro-abortion radicals have vandalized and/or fire-bombed pro-life organization offices and crisis pregnancy centers , with the threatening message left at some locations , \u201c If abortion isn \u2019 t safe , neither are you !\n\u201d On the other side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abortion clinic was recently set ablaze ( and in previous years , abortionists have been murdered ) .\nIf Roe is indeed overturned , these actions could foreshadow worse yet to come .\nRace : Even though George Floyd \u2019 s murderer is in prison , race relations remain a fire keg with radicals ready to take to the streets at the slightest pretext of real or imagined oppression .\nIf , God forbid , an unarmed African American is killed again by police\u2014particularly if it \u2019 s streamed on the internet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could erupt .\nCrime : Lax law enforcement practices in progressive cities such as San Francisco , Seattle , and Los Angeles have led to a terrible surge in property crime and violence .\nIf people ever come to believe that the police can \u2019 t\u2014or won \u2019 t\u2014protect them , some may be tempted to take the law into their own hands .\nGuns : With the recent atrocities in Buffalo and Uvalde , the country is again angrily arguing over the meaning of the Second Amendment and how to prevent mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to violence\u2014particularly if a gun confiscation scheme is attempted .\nIn this regard , it \u2019 s also worth noting that Kavanaugh \u2019 s would-be assassin told police that a second reason he allegedly wanted to kill him was the potential for a Supreme Court ruling striking down gun control legislation .\nVoting : The Jan. 6 , 2021 , Capitol breach was ignited by the certainty among Trump partisans that the 2020 election was stolen .\nAt the same time , I believe that if the former president had won the election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country .\nTo say the least , charges and counter-charges by partisans about supposed election fraud and/or voter suppression have created a tinder box atmosphere that could combust .\nHow do we keep the peace while still participating vigorously in the public square ?\nBleeding Kansas came to an end in 1859 , when a newly elected territorial governor brokered a cease-fire .\nThe contestants simply stood down and agreed to focus on peaceable means of persuasion .\nSimilarly banking the passions of contemporary politics will require responsible actions from our leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , government officials should cease all incendiary rhetoric .\nFor example , Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) must apologize for threatening Justices Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch , by yelling at a rally , \u201c You have released the whirlwind , and you will pay the price !\nYou won \u2019 t know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.\n\u201d Similarly , former President Donald Trump should cease the deeply personal invective against his political opponents .\nSecondly , federalism offers a way forward without surrender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many of the most contentious issues that divide us are currently unamenable to national solutions because half the country won \u2019 t accept the outcome and dissenting public officials will refuse to properly administer the law\u2014a phenomenon we \u2019 re already seeing in some places .\nThis means the left and right both need to temper their desire to legislate one-size-fits-all solutions for the entire nation and strive to enact policies at the state and local levels .\nForcing Nebraska to be like California\u2014and vice-versa\u2014simply won \u2019 t work .\nFinally , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charity .\nRather than assuming our political opponents act with malign motives , let \u2019 s strive to relearn the adage that reasonable people may differ .\nWe should also agree that violence and threats thereof against political opponents are never justified , which notably President Joe Biden has failed to do personally in the wake of the Kavanaugh plot .\nPursuing less volatile approaches to resolving our abiding differences may be less satisfying than demonizing political opponents .\nConvincing the entire country of the righteousness of our causes through committed persuasion will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d But that way is also far more likely to promote comity , lead to the enactment of enduring public policies majorities will accept , and keep the peace .", "author": "Wesley J.

\u2019 s massive increase in the money supply to pay people put out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its policy-induced supply chain constraints and energy shortages have been a chief driver of record inflation .\nAnd while the Biden administration has decided not to fund the defense of our Southern border , it is willing to spend $ 40 billion to allegedly defend the border of Ukraine .\nAnd then there is Biden taunting Russia and inviting retaliation against the United States .\nShould this bring on a Russian nuclear response and world war , Biden \u2019 s failed presidency would also go down as the most reckless of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of this makes sense , and particularly because almost all these problems were avoidable .\nIt has become clear to most people who are paying attention that Joe

modern species pairs.\n\u201d He says this \u201c poses a severe problem for Darwinian theory \u201c because it implies that the macroevolutionary processes that allegedly were at work and common during all periods of Earth history and in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absent in the origins of all of the millions of living species.\n\u201d Or as he puts it in a follow-up article on the same topic , \u201c Among the 350,000 described fossil species , we can identify numerous abrupt origins of new body plans within a 5\u201310 million years window of time .\nAmong an estimated 8.7 million recent species we find no such body plan disparity in any pairs of species that diverged in a similar time frame according to molecular clock studies .\nThis contradicts expectations from a Darwinian perspective.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ include firs and cedars ( both of them conifers ) , species of houseflies , the tree sparrow and house sparrow , the marine iguana and land iguana , the Moor frog and the European common frog , and two varieties of damselfly .\nBechly says that far from being exceptions to the rule , these species pairs , which have diverged very little over millions of years , are the rule , so much so that he \u2019 s waiting to be shown a single counterexample .\nWhat about something like Hawaiian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beak shapes ?\nBechly says that in all the ways that they vary , it \u2019 s been shown that only one or two genetic switches need to be made to account for the divergences .\nThis is very different from cases where an entire new body plan or system appears , such as the countercurrent heat exchange found in whales .\nIt \u2019 s these dramatic innovations that modern evolutionary theory needs to explain , and it \u2019 s precisely the kind of change we don \u2019 t see in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn addition to providing a lively summary of his article , Bechly also spars with Luskin , who gamely plays the devil \u2019 s advocate and poses a series of objections

months now , I \u2019 ve been tracking and looking into multiple homeless encampments across Seattle and King County .\n\u201c We \u2019 re working hard in this area .\nProbably harder than you \u2019 ve seen in recent years , \u201d says Mayor Bruce Harrell as he unveiled his homelessness dashboard last month .\nCity and state agencies are finally taking aggressive action , clearing some of the largest and most visible encampments on public property .\nGovernor Jay Inslee recently said homeless people who refuse to leave state land along highways could be fined .\n\u201c You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to follow the law .\nYou can \u2019 t be continuing to create these safety hazards on our right-of-ways , \u201d he says .\nWhile officials say most campers are accepting services and shelter ,

from people , \u201d she says .\nThe movement from city streets to wooded areas is creating unintended consequences .\nHere in West Seattle , massive wooden structures , abandoned tents , mounds of trash , and needles litter this hillside off Detroit Avenue SW. At nearby South Seattle College , this opening near the Seattle Chinese Garden leads into the West Duwamish Greenbelt , which is now a complicated network of pathways covered in garbage and drug paraphernalia .\nAnalissa Lafayette , who lives nearby , says she \u2019 s not sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c It \u2019 s pretty apparent once a site gets established , you not only have folks coming back and forth , but new folks coming back and forth , \u201d she says .\nBut no one was around the site when we visited .\nLafayette notes , \u201c There are going to be people who choose to stay homeless , \u201d but she \u2019 s concerned for their safety but also the environmental impact .\nShe wants city and state agencies to take immediate action : \u201c Let \u2019 s track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s happening.\n\u201d At this pond in White Center , the signs say it \u2019 s a wetland and considered fragile habitat for all kinds of wildlife .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a King County natural area \u2014 a sensitive area , an environmentally sensitive area , \u201d says Vivian McPeak .\nHe says it \u2019 s being illegally used by homeless people to hang laundry , cook food , and pitch tents

wants to be called Muhammed , who \u2019 s building a hut with a thatched roof .\nMcPeak says he \u2019 s concerned fresh trees are being cut down : \u201c This person \u2019 s been sawing off trees , limbs , a lot of them.\n\u201d But Muhamed says he \u2019 s simply using lifeless branches and plans on staying in this encampment for the long run , even if the county comes by and tries @ @ @ @ @ @

truly knows the magnitude of this problem .\nSeattle unveiled it \u2019 s new homelessness dashboard last month .\nBut it does not show exact locations of encampments , especially in the woods .\nAnd there \u2019 s nothing like what you see here in other counties or at the state level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast forest , I discovered even more campsites with clear signs of life .\nHowever , no one else responded .\nAfter more than an hour of exploring , I met this man who lives nearby .\nFearing retaliation from the people living in the woods , he wants to remain anonymous .\nHe speaks about the problems created by the unhealthy environment .\nHe says just in the past few months , firefighters have trekked through the constellation of trails to put out flames started by the homeless .\n\u201c And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OD \u2019 d victims , \u201d says this neighbor .\n\u201c And when they come back down , their hoses are literally been drug through feces , urine , and everything else .\nSo they have to spend three hours down at the street , washing their hoses .\nSo far this year , Puget Sound Fire has responded to dozens of medical emergencies in the woods , including seven fires

Authority is primarily responsible for providing services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean up .\nFor Silvera , however , the problem is she doesn \u2019 t know when the agency is going to provide help where she \u2019 s staying .\nWhen I asked her how many county outreach workers have come to offer services in the past year , she said maybe once .\nSimilar scenarios are playing out in other hidden parts of the region .\nIn White Center , several people are living on this environmentally sensitive area .\nBut the King County Department of Natural Resources and Parks says nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ updated by county leaders .\nAnd currently , no one is measuring the potential environmental damage .\nKing County Council member Reagan Dunn says the county is coming up with all kinds of excuses to avoid moving these encampments .\n\u201c The directive on Covid is for law enforcement not to disturb or mess with these camps because of the threat of covid , \u201d he says .\nBut the pandemic is no longer a factor for efforts by Seattle and the Washington Department of Transportation to clear public right of ways .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it pushes that homeless population into the woods , \u201d says Dunn .\nHe notes that many prefer \u201c to live free in acres of land maybe down by the river and do all the drugs they want.\n\u201d Last year , Dunn proposed legislation that would give the sheriff \u2019 s office authority to move into these wooded areas and clear encampments if shelter beds were available .\nBut the bill didn \u2019 t pass in the full council \u2014 Joe McDermott and Girmay Zahilay opposed the plan .\nI asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got back to me .\nExecutive Dow Constantine declined our interview requests as well .\n\u201c And that is because the leadership at King County government doesn \u2019 t want to upset their political base\u2014their political constituencies say leave those people alone \u2014 don \u2019 t enforce our laws , let them do drugs , let them be happy out in the woods , \u201d argues Dunn .\nSo Dunn introduced a new bill today , hoping for a different outcome .\nDunn \u2019 s new pilot program would form an interagency task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future encampments .\nThat also includes connecting the homeless residents with shelter and services .\nThe task force would include the Department of Community and Health Services , the Local Services \u2019 Road Division , and the Sheriff \u2019 s Office , working in collaboration with the King County Regional Homelessness Authority .\nThe focus initially would be on Green River Road , between Kent and Auburn in unincorporated King County .\n\u201c Unless you are willing to show some types of tough love in the homeless battle , you \u2019 re never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dunn .\nBut it \u2019 s not a done deal .\nDunn \u2019 s proposal still needs to be voted on by the entire council .\nThis time around he \u2019 s also trying to create an on-line dashboard to track all the encampments in King County .\nBut unlike Seattle \u2019 s dashboard , he wants it to show exact addresses , not just neighborhoods .\nKing County \u2019 s 2020 Point-in-Time count found that 64 % of the chronically homeless report battling a substance use disorder and 73 % report battling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Division Chief of Puget Sound Regional Fire Authority , highlights another problem in the woods .\n\u201c So I do know that we \u2019 ve had some fires up there , \u201d he says .\nHe isn \u2019 t blaming all the problems on the homeless staying in the woods .\nBut he \u2019 s hoping the policy makers consider the challenges first responders face trying to help in these tough conditions .\n\u201c There are the dangers of the needles and things like that , which you \u2019 ve seen firsthand \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , and you also want to consider fire fighter safety , \u201d says Pawlak .\nRight behind South Seattle College , the West Duwamish Greenbelt is a mess after a homeless take over .\nBut a school spokesperson says he \u2019 s not sure if this is even part of their property or responsibility .\nInstead of waiting around to find out , concerned neighbors called in Andrea Suarez with We

somber day when those 56 members of the Continental Congress committed to signing the Declaration of Independence .\nEach knew that becoming a signatory put a death warrant on their heads for being a traitor to Great Britain .\nThus , the first Declaration of Independence that was signed on July 4 did not have signatures identifying the committed delegates .\nRather , there were two signatures on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Continental Congress , and Charles Thomson , secretary of the Continental Congress .\nIt took more than two weeks for the Declaration to be \u201c engrossed \u201d \u2014that is , written on parchment in a clear hand .\nMany of the 56 delegates to the Continental Congress who had agreed to sign the document did so on August 2 , but new delegates replaced some six of the original delegates and an additional seven delegates could not sign until many weeks later .\nRecognizing the long odds against the small and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army and navy\u2014the most formidable military force in the world\u2014the Continental Congress decided to hold the 56-signatory Declaration for release at a later time .\nWashington was in New York preparing its defense when on July 6 , 1776 , a courier arrived to deliver a copy of the two-signature Declaration of Independence that had been released in Philadelphia several days before .\nDeeply moved by the power of the Declaration \u2019 s words , Washington ordered copies sent to all generals in the Continental Army and that chaplains be hired for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer and man , will endeavor so to live and act , as becomes a Christian Soldier , defending the dearest Rights and Liberties of his country.\n\u201d Like the Mayflower Compact , the Declaration was a true covenant with God of absolute commitment , with its last sentence invoking : \u201c with a firm reliance on the Protection of Divine Providence , we mutually pledge to each other our Lives , our Fortunes , and our sacred Honor.\n\u201d Washington read the Declaration repeatedly and became so moved that , on July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his troops \u2019 battle preparations and announced a respite and gathering to read the Declaration to his soldiers and the townspeople .\nThe crowd hustled down to lower Manhattan , where they gazed out at a forest of masts of the British ships at anchor in New York harbor .\nAfter the reading , when a few of the rowdies in the group spotted a statue of King George III , they pulled it down , to others \u2019 tumultuous cheers .\nBy August , about 35,000 professionally trained and well-equipped British and @ @

enlistees\u2014primarily farmers , fishermen , and artisans\u2014having no training .\nWhen engagement with the British finally commenced on Long Island on August 27 , the colonial army was quickly overwhelmed , with more than 1,000 taken prisoners .\nWashington decided to retreat from Long Island back to Manhattan to regroup in hope of fighting more successfully another day .\nIt was not to @ @

greatest challenge then was maintaining the morale , confidence , and loyalty of his diminished and discouraged troops .\nCrossing over into Pennsylvania in early December , Washington \u2019 s army

Princeton .\nLeading from the front , Washington displayed such courage , \u201c with a thousand deaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men fought with greater vigor than ever and inspired the local townspeople to grab their arms and join in the fight .\nIn short order there were many more British than American casualties , resulting in defeat with the surrender of some 300 Redcoats .\nPerceiving this dual miracle as a harbinger of more victories to come , and perhaps with many recognizing the power of providence and the vital importance in the ideas manifest in the Declaration , the Continental Congress ordered the reprinting and dissemination to all the colonies of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 , 1777\u2014more than six months after the original document had been drafted and approved .\nThe Revolutionary War

persistence inspired and sustained everyone around him .\nOf the 56 signers of the Declaration , nine fought and died from wounds or hardships of the Revolutionary War .\nTwo had sons serving in the Continental Army who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captured and tortured as traitors , and later died .\nTwelve of the 56 Declaration signers had their homes looted and destroyed .\nThe Americans \u2019 willingness to sacrifice was on display during the battle of Yorktown from September 28 to October 19 , 1781\u2014the decisive and final battle in the war for independence .\nThomas Nelson , Jr. a signer of the

libertarians\u2014which is a polite word for social Darwinism .\nBut conservatives generally oppose legalization , understanding the devastating social costs and personal dissipation that hard drug abuse causes to families , communities , and individuals who would be tempted to imbibe by the lack of potential legal consequence .\nUntil now , that is .\nAn increasing number of supposedly conservative organizations have fallen for the notion that criminalizing drug possession causes more harm than good .\nThese conservatives are now pitching other conservatives to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of \u201c harm reduction.\n\u201d One such organization is \u201c End It for Good , \u201d which self-describes as founded by a \u201c conservative Christian wishing to replace criminalization \u201d with as the site puts it , a program to \u201c reduce harm from drugs and help more people thrive.\n\u201d How ?\nOne article on the group \u2019 s website sighs , \u201c Imagine churches and community organizations throughout the state offering their facilities and a few volunteers to host a weekly telehealth counseling session for those in their local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but how na\u00efve can you be ?\nWe are talking about hard drug addiction !\nSuch pie-in-the-sky feel-goodism of a world in which well-meaning counselors oozing empathy and praying with substance abusers in church basements or over Zoom streams is no match for the cruel physical and psychological realities of the drug-abusing life .\nIndeed , we already tried that kind of soft approach with mental illness .\nYears ago , many of our mental hospitals were closed because they were seen as unduly restrictive of personal freedom .\nThe ability to institutionalize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The supposedly punitive prior approach was supposed to be replaced with friendly local mental health centers that would help people in need of care in their own communities without the stigma of hospitalization .\nNice idea .\nBut the community resource centers were often not built .\nLocal support services never sufficiently materialized .\nAll these years later , there simply are not enough programs to treat the number of mentally ill people who need help .\nConsequently , un- or under-treated mental illness\u2014along with addiction\u2014have become prime causes of our homeless crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the harm reduction approach to hard drugs .\nLegalizing scourges like heroin , fentanyl , meth , cocaine , crack , and oxycodone will axiomatically lead to more people taking these life-destroying substances .\nAnd it will communicate to addicts and those tempted to inject , snort , or swallow these cruel life destroyers that using is respectable and acceptable .\nLegalization will also increase availability and reduce prices , exacerbating our conjoined crises of mental illness , homelessness , and overdose deaths .\nOn a macro level , it will lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4-Ds \u201d : dissipation , dysfunction , decadence , and decline .\nThat isn \u2019 t just supposition .\nWe already have real-life models of what hard drug legalization would look like in the United States .\nWitness San Francisco , Seattle , and Los Angeles , where district attorneys have refused to prosecute drug violations .\nThe outcome ?\nA precipitous decline in quality of life , a steep increase in street squalor\u2014with human feces on the streets in some places\u2014and a spike in property and violent crime .\nBecause the laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swaths of these once world-class cities have become fetid cesspools\u2014even as the cost of living in these cities has sky-rocketed .\nWhat a mess .\nSocietal deterioration is infectious .\nFollow the same policies across the country , and we will derive the same results .\nWe are already seeing hints of that with the great marijuana legalization experiment .\nI \u2019 m not talking about medical marijuana\u2014which has legitimate purposes just as opioids do to control pain when properly prescribed .\nBut because weed has become more potent , legalized recreational marijuana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality of lives in the communities where it \u2019 s permitted .\nFor example , studies have shown that marijuana users have a greater likelihood of suicidal ideation .\nIt can cause hallucinations and a gastrointestinal malady known as cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome , the symptoms of which include heavy and repeated uncontrollable vomiting .\nA study published last year in JAMA Psychiatry reported evidence that a \u201c component cause of schizophrenia \u201d may involve heavy use of marijuana .\nIndeed , according to the report 8 percent of schizophrenia diagnoses in Denmark \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Colorado \u2019 s marijuana legalization experiment has had measurable deleterious consequences .\nFor example , a 2019 medical study found that traffic deaths involving drivers who tested positive for marijuana \u201c more than doubled from 55 in 2013 to 115 people killed in 2018 .\nThis equates to one person killed every 3 days in 2018 compared to one person killed every 6\u00bd days in 2013.\n\u201d That \u2019 s not all .\n\u201c College age marijuana use increased 18 percent and is 48 percent higher than the national average , currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get this : \u201c The yearly number of emergency department visits related to marijuana increased 54 percent after the legalization of recreational marijuana ( 2013 compared to 2017 ) , \u201d with the yearly number of marijuana-related hospitalizations increasing 101 percent over the same time period .\nIf it \u2019 s that bad with marijuana , imagine how much worse it would be if we swept away legal penalties for the abuse of harder , more dangerous drugs .\nThe inevitable outcome would be more addiction , increased deaths , and destroyed families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that jail should be the primary societal response to drug abuse .\nIt shouldn \u2019 t even be the first approach when the crime is simple use or possession .\nBut helping people avoid hard drugs\u2014and inducing them to get clean\u2014requires continued illegality , if only as a means of inducing abusers to seek help .\nIn other words , reducing and preventing addiction often requires a stick as well as a carrot .\nSo , by all means , let \u2019 s increase the availability of rehabilitation services .\nLet \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and families struggling with substance abuse .\nAnd allow those arrested for drug possession the first , second , or even third times to opt into a structured rehab program instead of incarceration or other punishment that can culminate with all charges dropped once the accused successfully completes the program .\nBut don \u2019 t drop the potential for criminal penalties .\nDon \u2019 t eradicate that option for providing needed social structure and coercive inducement to quit abusing .\nBecause if we follow the End It For Good-recommended approach , we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of more addicts , increased crime , worse homelessness , and exacerbated mental illness , all without the concomitant commitment of society to devote the necessary resources required to help people stay clean .", "author": "Wesley J.

Backing Atheists and Started Pointing Back to God", "content": "Headlines lately have not been encouraging for the faithful .\nA Gallup poll shows that the percentage of Americans who believe in God has fallen to 81 percent\u2014a drop of 10 percent over the last decade and an all-time low .\nThis accelerating trend is especially pronounced among young adults .\nAccording to a Pew Research Center poll , 18-29 year-olds are disproportionately represented among so-called \u201c nones \u201d \u2014atheists , agnostics and the religiously unaffiliated .\nPastors and other religious leaders have attributed this trend to many factors : young people being raised outside the church , an unfamiliarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 .\nWe found another answer in our national survey to probe the underlying reasons for this growing unbelief : a misunderstanding of science .\nPerhaps surprisingly , our survey discovered that the perceived message of science has played a leading role in the loss of faith .\nWe found that scientific theories about the unguided evolution of life have , in particular , led more people to reject belief in God than worries about suffering , disease , or death .\nIt also showed that 65 percent of self-described atheists and 43 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of science [ generally ] make the existence of God less probable.\n\u201d It \u2019 s easy to see why this perception has proliferated .\nIn recent years , many scientists have emerged as celebrity spokesmen for atheism .\nRichard Dawkins , Lawrence Krauss , Bill Nye , Michael Shermer , the late Stephen Hawking , and others have published popular books arguing that science renders belief in God unnecessary or implausible .\n\u201c The universe we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if , at bottom , there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pitiless indifference , \u201d Dawkins famously wrote .\nYet , between message and reality , there is a major disconnect .\nOver the last century , important scientific discoveries have dramatically challenged science-based atheism , and three in particular now tell a decidedly more God-friendly story .\nFirst , scientists have discovered that the physical universe had a beginning .\nThis finding , supported by observational astronomy and theoretical physics , contradicts the expectations of scientific atheists , who long portrayed the universe as eternal and self-existent\u2014and , therefore , in no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for what scientists call the Big Bang has instead confirmed the expectations of traditional theists .\nNobel laureate Arno Penzias , who helped make a key discovery supporting the Big Bang theory , has noted the obvious connection between its affirmation of a cosmic beginning and the concept of divine creation .\n\u201c The best data we have are exactly what I would have predicted , had I nothing to go on but the five books of Moses\u2026 [ and ] the Bible as a whole , \u201d writes Penzias .\nSecond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the universe reinforce this theistic conclusion .\nSince the 1960s , physicists have determined that the fundamental physical laws and parameters of our universe are finely tuned , against all odds , to make our universe capable of hosting life .\nEven slight alterations of many independent factors\u2014such as the strength of gravitational or electromagnetic attraction , or the initial arrangement of matter and energy in the universe\u2014would have rendered life impossible .\nScientists have discovered that we live in a kind of \u201c Goldilocks Universe , \u201d or what Australian physicist Luke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Not surprisingly , many physicists have concluded that this improbable fine-tuning points to a cosmic \u201c fine-tuner.\n\u201d As former Cambridge astrophysicist Sir Fred Hoyle argued , \u201c A common-sense interpretation of the data suggests that a super-intellect has monkeyed with physics \u201d to make life possible .\nThird , molecular biology has revealed the presence in living cells of an exquisite world of informational nanotechnology .\nThese include digital code in DNA and RNA\u2014tiny , intricately constructed molecular machines which vastly exceed our own digital high technology in their storage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has acknowledged that \u201c the machine code of the genes is uncannily computer-like \u201d \u2014 implying , it would seem , the activity of a master programmer at work the origin of life .\nAt the very least , the discoveries of modern biology are not what anyone would have expected from blind materialistic processes .\nAll this underscores a growing disparity between public perceptions of the message of science and what scientific evidence actually shows .\nFar from pointing to \u201c blind , pitiless indifference , \u201d the great

undetected , and began a steep dive , plummeting from 35,000 feet to 5,000 before the pilot regained control and righted the aircraft moments from splashdown .\nTo fully appreciate the difference jets made , one had to have taken a transcontinental flight on a propeller airplane .\nThat I experienced firsthand , months shy of turning 10 , in March 1957 , flying New York to Los Angeles on the Douglas DC-7 .\nThe flight took 9 hours , 30 minutes into ferocious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the return , aided by tailwinds .\nWhen I made my first 707 transcontinental round-trip , between the same cities , during my school \u2019 s 1959-1960 Christmas vacation , the flight duration was 53/4 hours outbound , 41/2 hours back .\nThen came July 1969 , when I had the memorable pleasure of flying Pan Am Clipper class on a day flight to Paris ; the food was excellent , served with china , silver , and glassware .\nI knew not that a calamitous end to 1960s flight nirvana was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Age of Air Travel began to unravel on Oct. 31 , 1969 , when a deranged Vietnam veteran \u2014 sorry for the generally inaccurate stereotype ; most vets are well-adjusted , but that is what this hijacker was \u2014 hijacked a flight from Los Angeles to Rome .\nThe plane , originally a domestic flight , was forced to fly multiple stops to reach Rome .\nAll passengers and two of three stewardesses were allowed to exit in Denver ; one remained , along with the flight crew , for the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jailed , but then granted clemency by the Italians , reportedly due to public opposition to America \u2019 s Vietnam entanglement .\nHijacking ended air travel \u2019 s Golden Age by ruining the airport experience , an integral part of travel ; on many flights , passengers spent more time in the airport than they did in flight .\nAll bags \u2014 though not persons \u2014 were subjected to search ; my first such experience was before boarding a 1970 New York to LA flight .\nOverseas it was a commonplace for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tarmac before it was loaded into the cargo hold .\nHijackings of U.S. airplanes actually began with destination Cuba , in 1958 ( just before Fidel Castro \u2019 s 1959 takeover ) ; they continued for 45 years .\nDuring the 1960s such episodes were a source of material for comedy routines on variety shows ; but with the upsurge in global terrorism in 1968 , including hijackings , they ceased to be amusing news .\nThe monster event transpired when a prominent Palestinian terror group commandeered four jumbo jets in 1970 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where three of them were blown up \u2014 fortunately , after all passengers had been freed .\n( A fifth jetliner was hijacked in London , but the pilot forced the plane into a dive ; the hijackers were overpowered \u2014 one was fatally shot , and one injured . )\nThere was little to cheer about until 1976 , which offered one welcome respite from the depressing news of serial skyjacks \u2014 some of those resulting in passengers being murdered before the events ended .\nCelebrated throughout the Western world was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a passenger plane hijacked by West German and Palestinian terrorists , and taken to Entebbe , Uganda .\nTheir astonishing raid took place July 4 , a capstone to America \u2019 s Bicentennial birthday .\nAlfred Kahn , one of the leading regulatory economists of the 20th century , was the prime architect of the Carter Administration \u2019 s 1978 airline deregulation .\nAs chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board , which \u2014 in what was a first ever since the 1887 birth of administrative agencies \u2014 voted itself out of existence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple : \u201d Whenever competition is feasible , it is , for all its imperfections , superior to regulation.\n\u201d With characteristic candor he added , as to regulating air travel : \u201c I really don \u2019 t know one airplane from the other .\nTo me they are just marginal costs with wings.\n\u201d The outcome metrics for airline deregulation are impressive .\nLess than 20 percent of Americans had flown by 1965 ; by 2000 , more than half had flown at least one round trip per year .\nBetween 1970 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flyers had tripled .\nTen major carriers controlled 90 percent of the market , with the remainder split among eight smaller carriers .\nBut in 2020 , four major carriers controlled 80 percent of the market .\nA 2018 poll showed that 13 percent of Americans still had never flown .\nBut that sea change came at a stiff price for passengers : What had been during the first four decades of flight a classy , comfortable flight experience was transformed into a price-driven , no-frills ordeal .\nSeats grew smaller ; space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmade beds ; food became barely digestible ; flight attendants \u2014 in the Golden Age called ( not pejoratively ) stewards and stewardesses \u2014 became unisex , and many ( thankfully not all ) exuded the charm of prison guards .\nIn his monograph , Lessons From Deregulation : Telecommunications and Airlines After the Crunch ( AEI/Brookings , 2003 ) , Kahn noted that the \u201c hub-and-spoke \u201d airport model enabled carriers to offer direct service to many new markets .\nATC \u2014 Air Traffic Control \u2014 became a national issue in 1981 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that August .\nPresident Reagan decertified the union and hired replacement controllers .\nWithout a major air accident , Reagan \u2019 s gamble paid off .\nBut ATC remained a government function , run by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) .\nSeveral countries have privatized their ATC function .\nThe result was a vastly superior ATC operation , enabling closer flight spacing , more flexible reassignment , and hence , far superior service .\nThe FAA offers numbers for flights and passengers , as of 2021 .\nAs 2.9 million commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion were carried in 2021 .\nThere are 70,000 daily flights of all kinds \u2014 more than 16 million per year , handled by 520 ATC centers using 14,000 air controllers .\nAt any time , 5,400 planes are typically in the air , covering 5.3 million square miles of domestic airspace , utilizing some 5,000 public and over 14,000 private airports .\nThe Bureau of Transportation Statistics has additional data .\nIn 2019 \u2014 the last pre-pandemic year \u2014 U.S. airlines carried 8.6 million passengers , an average of 23,600 flights per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 85 percent .\n( Kahn notes that load factors in the decade before deregulation were under 53 percent , and that by 1997-2001 they were 70 percent . )\nFrom Calmer Travel we learn that individual planes follow a rather hectic schedule , up to a maximum of four flights per day .\nFactor in crew availability , flight-hour limits and delays \u2014 which affect 10 to 22 percent of scheduled flights , with one to three percent canceled outright , and in normal times \u2014 i.e.\n, no pandemic \u2014 there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A major bottleneck is our government-run ATC system .\nWhen compared to Canada \u2019 s privatized system , we learn this : Since 1987 , Australia , Canada , New Zealand , and Germany have switched over to private ATC operation .\nOpponents assert that safety will suffer , and that the U.S. skies are filled with vastly more planes , and that Canada \u2019 s system does not predict what will happen here .\nThe FAA plans to switch to electronic/GPS ATC this decade , but it remains aspirational .\nLegislation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ATC was given a stern test when that union representing air traffic controllers , PATCO , staged an illegal walkout in August 1981 , despite a law passed by Congress making such strikes illegal , and in defiance of a warning from President Reagan that those who did not return to work within 48 hours would be fired .\nHe quoted Calvin Coolidge : \u201c There is no right to strike against the public safety , anywhere , anytime , by anybody.\n\u201d Reagan , himself a former president of the Screen Actors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a legal strike , fired everyone who defied his order to return .\nIn his memoir , An American Life ( 1990 ) , Reagan wrote of what he called his first major domestic crisis , that PATCO \u2019 s leaders thought he was bluffing .\nHe fired most of the 13,000 members , hired new ones , and , discovered that the ATC system could be run safely with 6,000 fewer controllers .\nIn his account of Reagan \u2019 s White House years , President Reagan : The Role of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cannon wrote that \u201c Reagan \u2019 s action sent a resonant signal of leadership that would be long remembered.\n\u201d Cannon quotes a former chief of staff to President Ford , Donald Rumsfeld \u2014 who had not supported Reagan prior to the 1980 campaign \u2014 saying : \u201c It struck me as singular .\nYou had a president who was new to the office and not taken seriously by a lot of people .\nIt showed a decisiveness and an ease with his instincts.\n\u201d Entering the 21st century , commercial flight was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who flew during the Golden Age .\nIt was to get worse \u2014 much worse .\nOn Sept. 11 , 2001 the infamous 9/11 terror attacks killed nearly 3,000 people , and demolished the landmark NYC Twin Towers .\nThis led in short order to the creation of the Transportation Security Administration \u2014 TSA .\nGetting from the curb to the gate became a succession of screenings , including at times intrusive searches of one \u2019 s body .\nThen , come 2020 , came the pandemic , bringing \u201c mask totalitarianism \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when in April 2022 a federal judge struck down the CDC \u2019 s mandate for failure to follow the procedural rules governing administrative agencies .\nAs if this isn \u2019 t enough , the pandemic forced layoff and early retirements , creating a shortage of pilots .\nPilots at Southwest and Delta warn that pilot fatigue is on the rise , putting safety at increased risk .\nFAA rules limit pilots to 30 hours per week flying time , with at least 9 hours rest in between shifts .\nBut increased pilot fatigue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach allowable flight limits .\nAirline deregulation may be said to have at least conferred positive benefits , by making flying affordable to most of the American public .\nSecurity hurdles of some level were clearly necessary , albeit they inevitably greatly diminished the ground experience .\nNo matter what improvements might be made to available flight options , the ground portion is not likely to get better .\nThe devaluation of transit through airports is the most salient factor in the decline of the end-to-end travel experience .\nThus , end-to-end quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2014 security imperatives and ATC stagnation .\nOn top of that , the hyper-democratization of air travel ushered in a lowest-cost air transport model that sacrifices quality for quantity .\nThe Golden Age of Air Travel is over \u2014 grounded \u2014 for the foreseeable future .\nThere was , however , one bright , shining period when a new mode of air travel made for the fortunate few a travel experience that made one forget about ground travails .\nThat story will

Destroying Our Trust in Science", "content": "A just-published expos\u00e9 in the journal Science claims that a seminal study on the causes of Alzheimer \u2019 s disease may contain falsified data .\nThe 2006 report concluded that Alzheimer \u2019 s is caused by a buildup of a certain type of plaque in the brain\u2014a finding that has guided research into cures for Alzheimer \u2019 s ever since .\nBut now , critics claim that the original authors \u201c appeared to have composed figures by piecing together parts of photos from different experiments \u201d calling their conclusions into significant question .\nIf true , this is a scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Science article notes , the questionable study strongly influenced the funding of research into treatments , with the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) spending $ 1.6 billion pursuing the plaque hypothesis this fiscal year .\nEven worse , if scientific mistakes in the study were not caught during peer review because of data manipulation , it deprived Alzheimer \u2019 s researchers investigating other hypotheses of badly needed funding , perhaps delaying the development of effective treatments .\nFalsification of scientific research has been a chronic problem for the sector in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Korean researcher committed outright research fraud when in 2004 and again in 2005 , he convinced Science\u2014the same publication now exposing the problems with Alzheimer \u2019 s plaque research\u2014that he had perfected a method of cloning human embryos and created 11 patient-specific embryonic stem cell lines .\nDespite peer review , it was all a lie , and eventually the papers were withdrawn .\nBut those reports had a major political impact , influencing the government \u2019 s funding of embryonic versus adult stem cell research and affecting political debates around this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create cloned human embryos eventually succeeded in 2013 . )\nPerhaps the most famous\u2014and deleteriously impactful\u2014research fraud of recent times was published in The Lancet claiming that the MMR ( measles , mumps , rubella ) childhood vaccines can cause autism .\nDespite the paper subsequently being retracted by The Lancet , repeated follow-up investigations showing that the author allegedly committed blatant research fraud , and even the eventual revoking of his medical license , millions of people still believe the claim .\nOf course , not all false studies are fraudulent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all human endeavors , scientists sometimes make mistakes .\nThat appears to be the case with long-accepted research showing that clinical depression is caused by a chemical imbalance of serotonin in the brain .\nBut a new , in-depth review of the data reached the startling conclusion that \u201c the huge research effort based on the serotonin hypothesis has not produced convincing evidence of a biochemical basis to depression , \u201d which serves as the starting point behind many antidepressant medications .\nDoes that mean that anti-depressants don \u2019 t work ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut that crucial question will now require\u2014you guessed it\u2014more research .\nLet \u2019 s hope the correct answer comes quickly as these medications can cause suicidal ideation and other potentially serious side effects .\nAt this point many scientists will be screaming that catching fraud and research mistakes is part of the scientific method , which allows questioning of\u2014and challenges to\u2014even the most seemingly settled scientific findings .\nThat \u2019 s true , at least in theory .\nBut lately , that fail-safe process has been increasingly short-circuited by non-scientific ideological or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public health and science sectors .\nWhy , just the other day , former presidential COVID adviser Dr. Deborah Birx admitted that she has known all along that the vaccines would not prevent transmission of the disease .\nBut that isn \u2019 t what she and the administration said at the time , as she acknowledged in an interview on Fox News .\n\u201c I knew these vaccines were not going to protect against infection , \u201d she told Neal Cavuto .\n\u201c And I think we overplayed the vaccines , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s not going to protect against severe disease and hospitalization.\n\u201d But Birx \u2019 s mendacity by omission led to far worse consequences than that .\nThe falsehood that the jab would prevent the disease became the supposed scientific basis for vaccine mandates both in the public and private sectors .\nIndeed , remember President Joe Biden demagoguing by claiming that COVID had become \u201c a pandemic of the unvaccinated \u201d ?\nI sure do , and because of that , family members turned against each other and friends against friends .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pending of soldiers , cops , firefighters , medical personnel , and other essential workers who refused the jab .\nPerhaps if Birx and her colleagues in the national public health sector had been forthcoming about that issue from the beginning , all that societal discord and personal pain would have been avoided .\nDr. Anthony Fauci engaged in the same kind of gaslighting when he said early in the pandemic that masks weren \u2019 t protective .\nHe now admits that he lied because he wanted to make sure there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what justifies Fauci \u2019 s and then NIH head Francis Collins \u2019 s dastardly campaign to discredit the authors of the Great Barrington Declaration for daring to question the public health advisability of society-wide lockdowns ?\nNothing .\nThen , there was Fauci \u2019 s hubristic claim that criticizing him is anti-science because , \u201c I represent science.\n\u201d Good grief , what a failure of leadership .\nAnd let us not forget how blatantly ideologically woke the scientific and medical establishments have become .\nToday , critical race theory , radical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are pitched as if they are scientifically settled issues\u2014which they are not .\nIndeed , remember the advocacy article in The Lancet calling women \u201c bodies with vaginas ?\n\u201d How can we trust the conclusions of scientific studies published about these controversial cultural issues when the journals in which they appear are so clearly biased ?\nMoreover , who among us believes that these journals would publish solid research if the findings cut against the editors \u2019 ideological grain ?\nI sure don \u2019 t .\nThe harm done to science by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review , ideological bias , and outright lying by public scientific spokespersons can not be overstated .\nThere \u2019 s only one cure to the current malaise : unremitting and apolitical scientific excellence .\nOr to state it

\u2018Woke\u2019 Indoctrination Agenda", "content": "On July 12 , the U.S. Department of Education announced $ 68 million in grants for Full-Service Community Schools .\nPresident Biden has already requested $ 468 million for the 2023 fiscal year for community schools and has made it clear that an expansion of community schools falls within his policy agenda .\nWhat is behind this aggressive push for community schools by the White House , state governments , and the education establishment ?\nWhile the focus on the broader needs of the students and their families rather than just education seems benign , in reality , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a means to advance a radical , left-wing agenda on children , often without their parents \u2019 knowledge .\nThe unique feature of a community school is integrated student services , commonly referred to as wraparound services .\nThe school coordinates with outside organizations to provide services ranging from tutoring , housing assistance , food banks , clothing , language classes , medical care , dental care , and mental health services .\nThe philosophy behind these K-12 public schools is the belief that schools should help resolve challenges that make it difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poverty , housing instability , trauma , and a lack of quality health care .\nCurrently , the 10,000 community schools nationwide equate to roughly six to eight percent of U.S. public schools .\nBut if the federal government has its way , that number will increase dramatically .\nAt first glance , community schools sound like a great idea .\nWhat \u2019 s not to like about providing kids a host of needed services ?\nUnfortunately , however , as is usually the case when a powerful national education union gets involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this case , destructive results will ensue .\nOne of the most passionate champions of community schools is Becky Pringle , President of the National Education Association ( NEA ) .\nAs the largest labor union in the country , the NEA provides millions of dollars to Democratic candidates and causes .\nBefore the Biden Administration took office , Pringle met with the Biden-Harris team to push community schools as a model .\nPringle advocates that \u201c Every school should be a community school.\n\u201d To fuel that effort , Pringle allocates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools to community schools , with hopes that the work will be her legacy .\nHer starting point is the country \u2019 s 100 largest school districts .\nFormer New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and California Governor Gavin Newsom have also pumped billions into community schools , with aggressive goals for turning traditional public schools into community schools .\nSchool partnerships with youth associations , healthcare providers , social services , and community organizations can be positive .\nHowever , in the case of community schools , the partnerships sought include Planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other left-wing community organizations .\nThe goal is clear : leverage public funding to advance a radical worldview and political agenda .\nPresident Biden recently came under fire for his telling statement to teachers that school children are \u201c not somebody else \u2019 s children ; they \u2019 re like yours when they \u2019 re in the classroom.\n\u201d The community school effort seeks to further transfer authority over children from their parents to the education establishment .\nTake , for example , the health care services provided by community schools .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parent , coordinating dental or medical appointments \u2014 parents need not schedule nor attend the appointments , including physical exams .\nFurthermore , in many cases , communication with the parents is not required , so parents aren \u2019 t even aware of the medical counseling or treatment their child has received .\nThe most alarming area of this ideological battle involving our children is that of sex/gender .\nAcross the nation , confused children , swayed by school personnel with an ideological agenda , are funneled toward sexually related treatments such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross-sex hormones , and even surgeries aimed at making the child appear as the opposite sex .\nMany of these \u201c treatments \u201d can result in sterilization and other lasting damage .\nMeanwhile , parents can easily be unaware that these major , irreversible decisions are taking place .\nIn this brave new world , parents can not only be locked out of the decisions but lose custody of their child if they are anything less than affirming of the radical gender ideology .\nAbby Martinez is one parent who lost custody of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c transition.\n\u201d In the end , Martinez \u2019 s daughter tragically took her own life three years after she began taking cross-sex hormones as her depression deepened .\nThe true agenda of the community school effort can be seen as its proponents \u2019 emphasis on gender inclusivity and LGBTQ rights .\nObviously , schools have a responsibility to promote respect for the dignity of each person as well as to implement strong anti-bullying policies .\nBut that is quite different than the promotion of radical ideology and services provided toward life-changing decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their parents .\nThe NEA \u2019 s central role in the push for community schools should be a red flag , as their motives have been made obvious by their endorsement of a host of radical policy agendas .\nFor example , following the overturning of Roe v.

homes at CFV that draw admiring eyes , and not the dramas occurring within them .\nThat \u2019 s not surprising .\nI Googled \u201c tiny house \u201d and came up with up with 418 million results in

example , pot-smoking is not a cause for arrest in Austin nor a cause for exclusion at CFV .\nThose who want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counseling , and support groups , but no such involvement is required .\nAll CFV residents need to pay $ 300-500 each month for rent , but how they get the money is up to them , as long as they don \u2019 t break laws to get it .\nMost are on some kind of governmental

@ @ @ @ can progress from dorm to shared room to private room , all in preparation for an apartment in the world outside .\nAmbition of that sort motivates some who are younger , but given the wear-and-tear of living on the streets , the average CFV resident at 59 is more like 70 physically and yearning to stay put in the same tiny house , unless new disabilities or marriages occur .\nAt

Trojan Horse in Grand Forks, North Dakota?", "content": "When Chris Wray , the current director of the FBI who has served under Republican and Democrat administrations , emphatically speaks out about the greatest threat to America , people should listen .\nDirector Wray has said repeatedly to different audiences around the country : \u201c There is just no country that presents a broader threat to our ideas , innovation , and our economic security than China\u2026 Chinese government hackers have stolen more of our personal and corporate data than all other countries combined.\n\u201d To obtain the most coveted data and information , which is defense and military-related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they call United Front operations and infiltration in diverse sectors from political associations to individual politicians , from industry associations to specific businesses , and from academic institutions to the media .\nThe circumstances leading up to the entry of a Chinese company , Fufeng Group , into the U.S. market is particularly instructive in showing how the CCP United Front operates through infiltration .\nCreating a false front , as the ancient Greeks did in 1184 B.C .\nin building a Trojan horse to clandestinely enter the city of Troy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what is likely going on in Grand Forks North Dakota , with the Chinese Company Fufeng getting a foothold with property acquisition and obtaining a permit for the construction of their first wet corn mill processing plant about 13 miles from the Grand Forks Air Force Base ( GFAFB ) .\nThat base plays a central role in America \u2019 s defense , providing home to the 319th Air Base Wing , the only Air Mobility Command to have remotely piloted aircraft systems , such as RQ-4 Global Hawk Unmanned Aerial Vehicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most sophisticated military drone technology .\nHaving a location some 13 miles from GFAFB can enable the Chinese to intercept digital uplinks and downlinks inherent with unmanned drones and air systems and their interactions with space-based assets .\nSince the Chinese PLA drone and space-based technology is well behind that of the U.S. this of course is one of the highest value targets for Chinese espionage .\nSo how did this come about ?\nThe Chinese penetration of North Dakota and other states follows classic United Front strategy that gained enormous momentum during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchanges and Sister City Friendship programs to some 200 American cities .\nIn 2010 , then North Dakota Governor Hoeven struck a deal to establish a Confucius Institute at Dickinson State University that greatly expanded the enrollment of Chinese students .\nThat program ended up in egregious enrollment irregularities , faked grades and diplomas being awarded to hundreds of Chinese students who failed to meet the basic qualifications for graduation .\nIn addition , there was a massive coverup of missing money and hundreds of students who obtained F1 Education visas , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have disappeared into America .\nWhile this huge scandal brought about the firing of DSU President Richard McCallum and the suicide of DSU Dean Doug LaPlante , no one ultimately faced any charges , prosecutions or fines .\nThose involved at DSU carried on as though the fraud never happened , and the state \u2019 s elected officials harbored the same inclinations .\nIt \u2019 s likely that none of this missed the attention of the Chinese .\nAt a minimum , the Chinese were emboldened by what they could see as free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforcement by people in authority positions at Dickinson and in the North Dakota government .\nDuring this time the CCP United Front group known as the Chinese Peoples Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries continued its annual meetings with the U.S. association known as the State Legislative Leaders Foundation .\nIn addition , the U.S. Governors Association was meeting with its Chinese counterparts ( most of whom are likely members of the CCP ) .\nRelations between the Chinese and state government officials grew through these meetings , laying the foundation for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsidiary , Fufeng USA in Chicago in 2020 and then make entry into Grand Forks in 2022 .\nFufeng Group \u2019 s primary products include monosodium glutamate and xanthan gum .\nNeither of those products will be manufactured at the proposed Grand Forks plant .\nFufeng USA \u2019 s quiet entry into Grand Forks enabled the 330-acre land purchase made up from adjacent parcels from three sellers to get executed early in early 2022 without much fanfare .\nBut that all began to change in June 2022 , with numerous dissidents and opponents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meetings .\nEric Chutorash , the Chief Operating Officer of Fufeng USA in charge of the Grand Forks plant project , was asked about why Grand Forks was chosen as their first foray into the U.S. market .\nHe acknowledged that of the 25-odd sites under review , Grand Forks was not an ideal location , but by their calculations they could make it work .\nIt \u2019 s no secret that China has been aggressively buying up farmland in America .\nBut Fufeng USA \u2019 s purchase in Grand Forks is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relatively small parcel of less than ideal cropland .\nIt is , however , a suitable site for commercial building with relatively close proximity to a US Air Force Base that now hosts a vital unit of the US Space Force , which together are responsible for America \u2019 s most sophisticated drone and space-related technology .\nAnother person testifying before the City Council meeting expressed concern that Chinese people might be brought in to work in the plant in various capacities including engaging in espionage on the Grand Forks Air Force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were no Chinese people working for Fufeng USA now , nor would there be in the future .\nIn his testimony , Chutorash also expressed a lack of understanding about how the CCP controls Chinese companies like Fufeng , and its American subsidiary .\nIt was observed off the record that Chutorash was seen in Grand Forks being accompanied by two native Chinese .\nOn the

imaginary comic-book character , so where did Marvel \u2019 s writers James Starlin and Mike Friedrich get their inspiration about his ideology of scarcity when they introduced the character in February of 1973 ?\nAs anyone who uses Excel knows , modeling is exhilarating and can produce surprising results , especially when using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t have Excel , Thomas Malthus birthed the modern practice of employing exponents to create models .\nIn his Essay on the Principle of Population he theorized \u201c Population , when unchecked , increases at a geometrical ratio .\nSubsistence

condescending implication that mathematics \u201c proved \u201d his theory .\nStarlin and Friedrich were creating Thanos in the midst of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vietnam War , the Middle-East oil embargo , and fears of a silent spring combined to produce a dystopian vision of the future .\nPaul Ehrlich had published The Population Bomb in 1968 and the Club of Rome published Limits to Growth in 1972 .\nBoth books obsessed on exponential population growth .\nFrom 1950 to 1970 population had been growing at around 1.8 percent a year .\nWhile this is technically exponential growth , it is nothing like the \u201c hockey-stick-shaped \u201d growth their cleverly scaled charts depict .\nEhrlich wrote that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ve got to reduce the size of the entire human enterprise.\n\u201d Limits to Growth spends 20 pages exploring the miracle of compound growth .\nTheir primary concern was the \u201c super-exponential rise in world population.\n\u201d World population in 1972 was around 3.8 billion .\nIt is closer to 7.8 billion today .\nThis indicates a 1.5 percent annual rate of increase , but hardly \u201c super-exponential.\n\u201d The highest annual growth rate on record was 2.1 percent in 1962 .\nBy 2020 it had fallen to 1.04 percent.1 Limits to Growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or collapse was to have zero population growth by 1975 .\nThere was an obscure economics professor at the time who read Ehrlich \u2019 s book and at first agreed with the scenario but decided he should check the historical facts on resources before accepting the theory .\nWhat he discovered was that as population increased , the prices of resources actually decreased .\nHis data suggested that more people made things more abundant .\nThis professor was Julian Simon .\nHe wrote up his findings in Science magazine in the spring of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public debate about the relationship between resources and population .\nEhrlich argued that as population increased prices would increase and abundance would decrease .\nSimon argued the opposite , as population increased prices would decrease and abundance would increase .\nFinally in frustration Simon offered to make a bet .\nSimon let Ehrlich pick any resources and the bet had to be for at least one year .\nEhrlich and two of his friends jumped at the offer and selected five metals : copper , chromium , nickel , tin , and tungsten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a basis of one thousand dollars .\nIf inflation-adjusted pries increased , Simon owed Ehrlich the difference .\nIf these prices decreased , Ehrlich owed Simon the difference .\nIn October of 1990 Paul Ehrlich sent a check to Julian Simon for $ 576.06 .\nThe nominal prices had fallen by 57.6 percent while the inflation-adjusted prices had fallen by 36 percent .\nAs a followup to this bet , I and Dr. Marian Tupy , senior fellow at the Center for Global Liberty and Prosperity at the Cato Institute , analyzed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy , food , materials , minerals , and metals from 1980 to 2020.3 We used World Bank , IMF , and Conference Board data and found that the average time price ( the time required to earn the money to buy one unit of the commodity ) had fallen by 75.2 percent .\nWhat this means is that the time required to earn the money to buy one unit in 1980 would get you 4.03 units in 2020 .\nThe world experienced a 303 percent increase in personal resource abundance .\nDuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased 75.8 percent from 4.434 billion to 7.795 billion .\nEvery one percent decrease in time prices corresponded to a one percent decrease in time prices .\nPersonal resource abundance increased by 303 percent while global population increased by 75.8 percent .\nEvery one percent increase in population corresponded with a four percent increase in personal resource abundance .\nGlobal resources can be measures as the personal resource abundance multiplied by the size of the population .\nSince population increased by 75.8 percent , global resources increased by 609 percent .\nEvery one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8.03 percent increase in global resource abundance .\nMore people are making resources much more abundant .\nIn a sense Thanos was correct , the number of atoms on

Federation of Teachers ( AFT ) President Randi Weingarten was instrumental in keeping kids locked out of in-person schooling as she mercilessly pushed the union \u2019 s self-serving political agenda .\nNow she uses the dire situation she helped create as the excuse for the teacher-shortage crisis .\nIn May 2021 , released emails showed Weingarten \u2019 s direct influence on the CDC \u2019 s February 2021 guidelines for reopening schools , which shied away from recommending schools fully reopen even as mounting scientific evidence demonstrated it was safe to do .\nClearly the AFT \u2019 s nearly $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Biden and other Democratic candidates in the 2020 election cycle was paying dividends .\nTrying to deflect the scandal concerning how AFT \u2019 s recommendations made it almost verbatim into the final CDC guidance , Weingarten claimed that the \u201c AFT represents 1.7 million educators , health-care professionals and public employees who spent the last 14 months serving on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic .\nSo naturally , we have been in regular touch with the agencies setting policy that affect their work and lives , including the CDC.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employees not returning to school , and offering a few hours a day of Zoom sessions , equates to \u201c serving on the front lines \u201d during the pandemic .\nWeingarten recently rose to a new level of audacity by shifting the blame for the school staffing crisis on Republicans , who she claims politicized public education by creating an environment that drove the teacher shortage .\nIronic , to say the least , given AFT \u2019 s allocation of 30 percent of its 2020-2021 expenditures to politics , totaling $ 48.4 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million in contributions .\nAnd they \u2019 re only second to the National Education Association ( NEA ) , which devotes nearly 50 percent of its expenses to political endeavors , according to Americans for Fair Treatment research .\nGiven the NEA spends twice as much on politics ( almost all of which is devoted to Democrats ) than on representing its members , the union resembles a political , rather than membership , organization .\nNo wonder teacher union members are moving on .\nMost teachers presumably entered the profession to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSo , it \u2019 s not surprising their inability to interact in-person with students has driven many to take flight \u2014 whether through early retirement , moving to private education , or entering a new profession .\nAlso contributing to teacher flight has been COVID-19 fearmongering pushed by the union as well as the vaccine and mask mandates forced upon educators .\nAnd as the teacher shortage grew , so did class sizes , making the challenge of catching students up after school closures spanning three school-years even more daunting .\nFinally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on students by the lack of structure experienced when they were forced out of school , it \u2019 s no wonder teachers feel overwhelmed to the point of quitting .\nThe magnitude of the crisis : According to the NEA , as of May , there were 380,000 unfilled positions in public education \u2014 a 70 percent increase over pre-pandemic staffing shortages in 2019 .\nAgain , abandoning responsibility , Weingarten and the Left cite low teacher pay as the culprit .\nThe solution proposed is , of course , higher teacher pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this point , give them credit for doing what unions do \u2014 protecting their members \u2019 jobs and negotiating for more pay regardless of performance .\nUntil we break the K-12 monopoly by empowering parents with education choices outside of the union-driven public system , as Betsy DeVos argues in her new book Hostages No More , the cycle will continue :

"content": "Historian David McCullough , who passed away on Aug. 7 , spent his life telling stories that his fellow citizens should know .\nHe wrote well-known biographies of John Adams , Theodore Roosevelt , Harry Truman , and the Wright Brothers .\nHe got his start chronicling the Johnstown Flood before turning to the creation of the Brooklyn Bridge and the Panama Canal and the early years of the American Revolution .\nBut McCullough was not just a teller of great American stories .\nHe was above all a patriot who possessed an undying wonder about and gratitude for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simon and Schuster published \u201c The American Spirit : Who We Are and What We Stand For , \u201d which features public addresses McCullough delivered that capture his love of the historian \u2019 s craft and the country he called home .\nIts passages are worth reflecting on as we remember his life and legacy .\nOne of the speeches McCullough delivered was at Hillsdale College in the spring of 2006 .\nHe spent the week there as a visiting professor , and I know he made a lasting impression on the students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was among them .\nMcCullough made more of difference in a week than many teachers make in a semester .\nHe made a difference by telling masterful stories and by how he carried himself \u2014 in class , during office hours , and in a public lecture he delivered on campus .\nHe was kind , witty , ever the gentleman .\nWhat McCullough brought to the telling of history was not hero-worship but humanity .\n\u201c If I say to you that the king died and then the queen died , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIf I say the king died and the queen died of grief , that \u2019 s a story .\nThat \u2019 s human .\nThat calls for empathy on the part of the teller of the story and of the reader or listener to the story , \u201d he said at Hillsdale .\nIn a speech at Dickinson College , McCullough commended key virtues that constituted the animating spirit of American founder Dr. Benjamin Rush : \u201c goodwill ( or good nature , as he said ) ; inexhaustible curiosity ( it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in everything and everyone ) ; and commitment \u2013 commitment to principle , commitment to service , to his country , and to the fundamental faith that education ought never to stand still , in the country and in one \u2019 s own life.\n\u201d If one had to define the animating spirit of David McCullough , these three virtues he found in Rush would be a good start .\nMcCullough wanted us to think of people as they experienced life \u2014 not in the past but in \u201c the present , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conference of the National Trust for Historic Preservation in 2001 .\nAnd he wanted us to know about them so we could conserve the good things they passed down to us .\n\u201c But let us not look down on anyone from the past for not having the benefit of what we know , or allow ourselves to feel superior , \u201d he told a Dickinson College commencement audience in 1998 .\n\u201c In my experience , the more one learns of that founding generation of Americans \u2013 and I mean the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myths \u2013 the larger they become , the more one wonders what we \u2019 ve lost , or are in grave danger of losing.\n\u201d Textbooks \u2018 created in order to kill \u2019 interest in history Those real flesh-and-blood human beings who founded the country were flawed , for sure , but they possessed important character traits that are worthy of recognition .\nIn a 1999 speech about the presidency at Dartmouth , he talked about the \u201c aspects of individual personality for which there are no ready measurements \u2013 the integrity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul , the courage of Harry Truman .\nOr think of the charm of Kennedy at a press conference , or Ronald Reagan in front of a television camera in almost any circumstance.\n\u201d McCullough lamented the state of academic textbooks , most of which were \u201c created in order to kill any interest one might have in history , \u201d he said at Hillsdale .\nIf a teacher is to attract students to the study of history , she or he must have the quality of enthusiasm , McCullough stated .\nIf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades are an indicator , enthusiasm is infectious .\nMcCullough not only wrote and taught history , but he reminded people of the importance of historical perspective in all kinds of endeavors .\nTo a University of Pittsburgh audience in his hometown in 1994 , he called for an urban studies program that would focus on the history of the Steel City .\n\u201c The core of such a program , I suggest , should be history , for the specific and realistic reason that all problems have history and the wisest route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem begins with understanding its history , \u201d McCullough said .\nThe failure of policy leaders to understand the history of places can have terrible consequences , he added .\nDavid McCullough was a citizen-historian whose words will live on .\nHis words \u2013 written and

U.S.", "content": "While technology and innovation have disrupted many sectors of the economy over the past several decades , the K-12 education industry has remained largely untouched .\nPublic education today operates nearly the same as it did decades ago , and not entirely different from its inception more than 175 years ago based on Horace Mann \u2019 s framework .\nKnown as the father of public education , Mann developed the American education model based on the Prussian system during the industrial age .\nThe approach is a one-size-fits-all model based on the faulty notion that all students of the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same length of time , and in the same way .\nTherefore , students are grouped by age , not understanding level .\nSubjects are taught one hour a day in isolation from each other , and the focus is on teaching toward the test .\nThe curriculum is fixed and not responsive to what students need or want to learn .\nConsidering that Mann died decades before the telephone was invented by Alexander Graham Bell , the lack of innovation in K-12 education is astonishing .\nIt \u2019 s long past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital industries of our country \u2014 the education system which shapes our future leaders , workforce , military , and electorate .\nDespite more money being pumped into the $ 800 billion K-12 public education industry each year , learning results continue to slip .\nU.S. students place 26th among other developed nations , and 77 % of students exit 13 years of K-12 public schooling failing to reach proficiency levels in foundational subjects .\nOne might object to the characterization that public schools are devoid of innovation by pointing to the remote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this serves only as a negative example of how the public education monopoly , dominated by self-serving teacher unions , tends to make terrible decisions regarding children \u2019 s education .\nIn this case , the long-term shuttering of schools caused a major disruption to the education of millions of students .\nAnd , despite all the talk of never going back to education as we knew it before the pandemic , when children returned to physical classrooms , little was unchanged in the education industry besides less instruction time and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disruption and innovation in other industries .\nUber , and later Lyft , reinvented what was before a monopoly held by taxicab companies .\nPreviously , the government tightly controlled the industry by requiring drivers to purchase taxi medallions ( which could cost several hundred thousand dollars ) in order to operate their cabs .\nAs a result of the government control , consumers had very little choice when hailing a ride .\nUber came along and disrupted the industry by creating a smartphone app in which the supply and demand of transportation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform .\nThe app also provided the ability to rate drivers and passengers \u2014 screening out bad actors who could spoil the experience .\nThe result was superior service at a lower cost .\nThe increased competition also forced taxicab companies to lower their rates and improve their service .\nSimilarly , Netflix and a host of other television and movie subscription providers disrupted the cable industry and put Blockbuster , the movie rental company that had dominated for 25 years , out of business .\nThe increased flexibility and convenience enjoyed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services and avoid a drive to a physical store to select a movie , transformed the television and at-home movie industry .\nAgain , the end result of the disruption was a superior user experience and more options at lower costs for consumers .\nOf course , there are outliers of innovation within K-12 education , such as online schools , hybrid models , microschools , learning pods , and beyond .\nHowever , these outliers are limited in the number of students they reach as most of those options require families to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fund K-12 public education .\nTo break the K-12 monopoly , families must be empowered with educational options beyond traditional public schools .\nArizona recently took the lead by becoming the first state in the nation to pass legislation providing all K-12 students with school choice .\nThrough the expansion of Arizona \u2019 s Empowerment Scholarship Account , each of the 1.1 million students in Arizona will soon have access to a $ 6,500 per year account , which can be used for private schools , online schools , homeschool , microschools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAt the scholarship program \u2019 s inception in 2011 , only about 100 students had this provision .\nThe program grew to serve 11,000 students by 2022 .\nWith 1.1 million students now having access to education freedom , alternative options to traditional and charter public schools will be in high demand .\nWho will answer that call ?\nThe opportunity is ripe for \u201c edupreneurs \u201d \u2014 entrepreneurs working in the education arena .\nNew schools , new school models , and innovative learning avenues are sure to result .\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with educational freedom , the market for edupreneurship will continue to grow .\nNow is the time for creative , innovative business minds with a passion and a vision for the future of education to step into this emerging arena .\nThe future of the nation depends upon our providing effective and meaningful learning for the upcoming generation .\nEdupreneurship coupled with universal school choice is the exciting and much-needed transformative future of American education .", "author":

And the latter wasted no time in preparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to smear , sabotage and annihilate Trump .\nThe FBI obtained what would turn out to be an illegitimate FISA warrant based on the phony Steele dossier paid for by Democrat rival Hillary Clinton to spy on Donald Trump \u2019 s campaign .\nAnd the spying on Donald Trump didn \u2019 t stop after he was elected but followed him all the way into the White House .\nThen Michael Flynn , who knew more about corruption in the Deep State through his experience as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was chosen by Donald Trump to serve as National Security Advisor .\nGiven Flynn \u2019 s patriotism and broad knowledge of Washington ways of corruption , the Deep State set its sights on taking him out .\nOnce again , the FBI was used to set things up in a good cop-bad cop dynamic to get Flynn to say something that could be used against him with regard to his communication with the Russian ambassador to the United States Sergey Kisliak .\nIt worked , Flynn was indicted in early 2017 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security advisor .\nHe then faced a multi-year legal battle that all but bankrupted him .\nThe next stage of the coup against Trump unfolded with Special Counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s investigation of the allegation that Trump had engaged in collusion with Russia , a process that lasted two years .\nThat turned out to be a hoax , but it succeeded in damaging Trump by opening the door to media fanfare around arrests of various associates and supporters who could be framed , such as : \u2013 Paul Manafort and Rick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chris Collins , who turned himself in to the FBI in August of 2018 .\n\u2013 Roger Stone , a longtime adviser to President Trump was arrested five months later on January 25 , 2019 .\nThat 29 FBI agents arrived locked and loaded at his house at pre-dawn , with lights flashing on 17 vehicles , with CNN being tipped off to capture it all on camera suggests of course that it was as much about show , intimidation , and demoralization of Trump \u2019 s base of supporters than it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was Rudy Giuliani , whose Manhattan apartment and offices were raided by the FBI on April 29 , 2019 .\nThe Mueller investigation exonerated Trump of Russian collusion , but that wasn \u2019 t about to stop the war to destroy Donald Trump .\nHouse Democrats then proceeded to impeach Trump on two charges : abuse of power and obstruction of Congress\u2014all hinging around a phone call Trump had with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky .\nTrump finessed it all by making the phone call transcript public\u2014collapsing the case and leading to vindication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSince there had been little pushback and no penalties from previous coup efforts , even those based on fraudulently obtained FISA warrants , the Deep State and Democrat Party operatives seized on the coronavirus fear environment to make yet one more coup attempt in Trump \u2019 s fourth year \u2014 this time putting in the fix on the November 2020 election to deny Trump any chance of a second term .\nThat effort in part focused on blanketing swing states with armies of lawyers filing suits to challenge voter ID laws , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for mail-in ballots .\nThen there was a push for wholesale distribution of ballots and mail-in balloting and the placement of ballot drop boxes in eight swing states\u2014all Democrat voting counties\u2014made possible by Facebook \u2019 s Mark Zuckerberg providing some $ 400 million .\nThe voting irregularities , the unprecedented early cessation of vote counting in key swing states where Trump had sizable leads , only to get flipped in Biden \u2019 s favor the next day when vote counting restarted , reeked of foul play to Trump \u2019 s supporters , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on January 6 , 2021 in hopes\u2014however vague or unlikely\u2014that some electors might refrain from certifying their state \u2019 s votes pending a forensic audit .\nThat was not to be and a small portion of the crowd , with incitement from well-placed agitators , entered the Capitol , creating a big media event with arrests and charges of insurrection .\nShortly thereafter , Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi filed yet another impeachment against Trump and later proceeded with a one-sided show trial , all clearly designed to paint Trump as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being able to run for a second term in 2024 .\nNow , as people have digested the recent FBI raid on President Trump \u2019 s personal residence at Mar-a-Lago , what do we the people do about this unparalleled abuse of Justice Department power ?\nMany who find this shocking are also confronted with a realization that we really are just a step or two away from becoming a full-fledged banana republic .\nAnd just in case your normalcy bias still prevents you from seeing this , we all got another jolt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act .\nAmong various provisions , this law provides $ 80 billion to the IRS to hire 87,000 new agents .\nThat will almost double its present size , making the IRS larger than the Pentagon , the State Department , the FBI , and the Border Control combined .\nSuch an enlarged IRS is inexplicable and makes little sense , until you do a little investigative research and connect the dots with such facts as the IRS having already stockpiled some 5 million rounds of ammunition and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and/or willing to be trained , in the handling of firearms .\nMove over FBI , there is a new federal agency being added to the government gestapo to harass and intimidate the American people .\nThe answer ?\nOvercome every false flag October surprise , show up in overwhelming numbers on Nov. 8 , and make sure ballots avert bullets .", "author": "Scott S.

"Labor Day Honors Exceptionalism That Won\u2019t Be Cancelled", "content": "For most , Labor Day can be a rather vague holiday without the clarity and meaning typically associated with other holidays .\nYet in its most complete context , Labor Day should be recognized as the holiday that celebrates not only labor , but also the ideas , job creators , and institutions central to the flourishing of the United States and its people .\nColonial America certainly benefited from the fact that early settlers were a self-selecting people willing to leave the familiarity of their European homes and cross a dangerous ocean .\nBecause they were tough , willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlers were predisposed to forgo immediate gratification and to work hard .\nAs a result , they not only prospered , but within a generation or two , many of their descendants achieved surprising wealth that in many cases was created from nothing .\nAdditionally \u2014 in contrast to today \u2014 what stands out about towns and cities in colonial America was the relative absence of poverty .\nIt was Alexis de Tocqueville , whose ever-relevant classic , \u201c Democracy in America , \u201d pointed out that in contrast to Europeans , Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In part , that was undoubtedly attributable to Christian influence in America .\nThe Holy Bible makes more than 450 references to the value and importance of work \u2014specifically referring to work as a virtue more times than it refers to other virtues , such as prayer , faith , hope , joy , forgiveness , mercy , grace , or peace .\nThus , it was and still should be widely recognized that work is good for the soul and necessary to a fulfilling life with dignity and meaning .\nThe idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was conceived in America in the 1880s by union labor leaders who sought recognition for the accomplishments of American workers .\nFinally , in 1894 , Congress voted to establish Labor Day as a national holiday to celebrate workers \u2019 contributions to the strength , prosperity , and well-being of the country .\nBut , as the U.S. laborers standard of living rose above those in the rest of the world , the tie between Labor Day and labor unions diminished .\nLabor Union membership peaked as a percentage of the entire American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nToday , the share of workers belonging to unions has dropped to a new low of 10.3 % .\nWhat is striking now is union membership ratio of government workers \u2014 at about 34 % \u2014 is more than five times higher than the union membership ratio of private-sector workers \u2014 at about 6.1 % .\nAnd just as the private sector economy has moved away from unionization , it \u2019 s entirely appropriate to recognize the need for a broader perspective and narrative about the meaning of the Labor Day holiday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it makes sense to also celebrate the entrepreneurs and the intermediaries who create jobs and new labor opportunities that come out of launching new business ventures .\nLike the early colonial settlers , these prophets and dreamers are often the ones most willing to take risks in developing new products , services , and market opportunities .\nWhat \u2019 s important to understand about Labor Day past and present is that these visionaries were the primary drivers of wealth creation that took the country from colonial poverty to world economic superpower in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have recognized that thread in history , find the Biblical reference of being \u201c the light of the world , a city set on a hill \u201d pertains not only to Christians \u2019 positive spiritual influence on society , but also find it applicable to America \u2019 s vibrant political and economic success being a constructive example for other nations .\nWe all know that 1776 was the year of \u201c Founding Fathers \u201d giving birth to America with the Declaration of Independence .\n1776 was also the year that the Scottish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as the \u201c Father of Capitalism , \u201d when he published \u201c The Wealth of Nations.\n\u201d Now a classic , it was at the time the first major work providing a comprehensive understanding of how the essential elements of the free market system \u2014 labor , private property , and capital \u2014 provide the foundation for entrepreneurs , scientists , inventors , financiers , laborers and consumers to freely interact for the economic benefit of society , producing results more proficiently than any other system , notably the socialist system .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ been between freedom and tyranny .\nEven before Marx wrote \u201c The Communist Manifesto \u201d and \u201c Das Kapital , \u201d de Tocqueville asserted : \u201c Democracy and socialism have nothing in common but one word , equality .\nBut notice the difference : while democracy seeks equality in liberty , socialism seeks equality in restraint and servitude.\n\u201d He added , \u201c You can \u2019 t have it both ways .\nSocialism is a new form of slavery.\n\u201d Anyone can see across nations and cultures that socialism has been associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those in control who waste and steal , while free enterprise has been associated with flourishing and opportunity to pursue happiness .\nSocialism not only fails because it misallocates resources and thwarts creativity , but also because it discourages and destroys the human spirit .\nEven if the idea of American exceptionalism seems unfitting for some in contemporary times , no one can deny certain facts about the ways in which America is unique among nations globally .\nThe United States represents only 4 % of the world \u2019 s population but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s creativity and 25 % of the world \u2019 s wealth , providing more upward mobility than any other nation .\nLittle wonder that America is the number one destination for immigration , which is the most reliable substantiation of the idea of America as an exceptional nation .\nWhat is also exceptional is the fact that the United States has had one constitution for 234 years , while the average length of other nations \u2019 constitutions in the world has been less than 20 years .\nWhat accounts for our nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique and exceptional , is found in its Declaration of Independence that established that citizens have unalienable God-given rights that can not be taken away by the state .\nThe Founding of the United States was an exceptional moment in human history , and because those ideas can not be cancelled or rescinded our country remains exceptional .\nLabor Day celebrates American exceptionalism through the work and the accomplishments of its diverse people .", "author": "Scott S.

alive.\n\u201d The problem is no one has permission to be here since the camp is on land owned by the Washington State Department of Transportation ( WSDOT ) .\nCritics say the camp is spiraling out of control .\nNeighbors and business owners are complaining about a surge in property crimes and retail theft in the area connected to the camp .\n\u201c We have number of pictures and videos of them

.\nAfter the city warned of an impending clearing , everyone moved their tents to the WSDOT property .\n\u201c This camp has more services provided to it than every shelter in this town .\nAnd I care for more people than any shelter in this town , \u201d says Garcia .\nBut Spokane Mayor Nadine Woodward says this is illegal .\n\u201c They have held the city hostage , \u201d she says .\nWoodward who

accountability.\n\u201d While elected officials and state leaders continue to play the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners say they \u2019 re caught in the middle of this jurisdictional stalemate .\nAcross the street at the Tapio Business Park , many businesses renting space at this office complex are now adding extra security .\n\u201c I have a building engineer who is cleaning up needles and fecal matter every morning , \u201d says Katie Bohr , Tapio \u2019 s property manager .\nLaura Salas manages Salas Real Estate and says people from the camp are also behaving in an obscene manner .\n\u201c There

.\nAccording to Spokane County \u2019 s Point-in-Time Count released in May , there are 1,757 homeless people in Spokane County \u2014 up 13 % in the past two years .\nIt \u2019 s likely even higher since the tally only included people in emergency shelters and transitional housing , not on the streets .\nThe Mayor hopes her city gets state money this year to build out a new shelter not that far from Camp Hope .\nEven then , there would not be enough beds for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And convincing many of them to move in will be another challenge .\n\u201c I \u2019 d rather stay in my RV because at

"discoveryinstitute", "title": "Tackling Misconceptions About Charter Schools", "content": "Since their humble beginnings in 1992 , with City Academy in St. Paul , Minnesota , charter schools have expanded to forty-four other states as well as the District of Columbia , and they now enroll well over 3.4 million students \u2013 roughly eight percent of all students nationwide .\nBut while charter schools have been around for thirty years , many Americans remain unfamiliar with or confused about the basic concept .\nWhat many don \u2019 t understand is that charter schools are public schools \u2013 funded by federal and state funds \u2013 but privately run .\nCharters serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often fail students , as is the case in virtually every major urban area with predominantly minority children .\nIn many cases , charters deliver significantly better educational outcomes than public schools in terms of standardized test scores and graduation rates .\nThe advantage of charter schools is that they are exempt from state and local regulations to a substantial degree , giving them the flexibility and autonomy to innovate and meet the needs of students .\nIn exchange for this freedom , these schools are held publicly accountable to their charter \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or district .\nCharter schools are reviewed periodically by their granting entity ; if the conditions of the charter aren \u2019 t met , their authorization can be revoked .\nA common misconception about charter schools is that they siphon off the best students from public schools and leave the remaining students to suffer in underperforming schools .\nThis isn \u2019 t the case , however : charter school admission is based on an open lottery system , which provides equal access to all students until capacity limits are reached .\nIt \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in their children \u2019 s education will be more likely to pursue enrollment in a charter school , but their chances for success are the same as all other parents who apply .\nSome charters schools choose to serve more specifically the needs of their communities .\nCharter schools can prioritize admissions to students who live in the district they serve , for example .\nOther charters indicate specific missions .\nThe HOLLA School in the Rockwood Community of Portland , Oregon , for example , states that its mission is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth.\n\u201d Another common misconception about charter schools is that they drain money from traditional public schools .\nIn most states , adjustments are made to compensate districts for enrollment losses to charter schools .\nAnd besides , the mission of charter schools has always been to provide an alternative within the public school system itself \u2013 often a sorely needed alternative , considering the one-size-fits-all approach typical of traditional public school systems .\nCharter schools are no panacea .\nNot all are equally successful with respect to educational outcomes , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As with any schooling decision , parents must determine what is best for their children .\nRather than a competitor to traditional public schools , charters are more of a model for how public school systems could be more responsive to student needs , while also producing better outcomes .\nSince they can lose their authorization if they don \u2019 t effectively serve their students , charters are accountable in ways that traditional public schools , even failing ones , are not .\nMany parents would love to have a charter school alternative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in some states limit parental options .\nIn California , teacher unions make huge campaign contributions to legislators who cripple charter schools by imposing onerous regulations and giving them considerably less funding than traditional public schools .\nIn California \u2013 where teachers get tenure after two years , pay increases are automatic regardless of performance , and full pension benefits start at age 62 \u2013 little incentive exists to innovate .\nCharter schools , by contrast , attract teachers who favor merit-pay increases based on student success in the classroom , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private entities .\nThe truth is , charter schools do more with less , outperforming their traditional public school counterparts .\nIf traditional public schools want to retain students , instead of complaining they should learn from successful charter schools and seek to raise the quality of education they provide so that parents won \u2019 t need to seek alternatives .\nUntil that happens , concerned parents will continue to support charter schools .", "author": "Walter Myers III", "url":

"Over the past year , education circles have seen the rise of calls to \u201c Teach the Truth.\n\u201d They \u2019 ve held rallies , taken pledges , and launched social media campaigns .\nIn principle , \u201c teaching the truth \u201d is a swell idea .\nIn practice , the problem is that it \u2019 s been championed by teacher unions and progressive groups with a very particular notion of what \u201c the truth \u201d entails .\nIndeed , their \u201c truth \u201d frequently seems to boil down to claims that the U.S. is a white supremacist \u201c slavocracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working people can \u2019 t get ahead in America .\nLook , these truthers are entitled to their views .\nBut the \u201c truth \u201d turns out to be more complicated than they seem to think .\nAmericans do confront real challenges .\nAmerica has always fallen short of our aspirations in important ways .\nAnd it is also true that American life is better and more bountiful than the education truthers are inclined to acknowledge .\nOn that score , it \u2019 s worth pondering a new book which should inform how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Superabundance , economists Gayle Pooley and Marian Tupy show just how extraordinarily better off Americans are today than we were even a few decades ago\u2014and how remarkably our well-being has improved over time .\nNow , usually , even when economists show how wealth , say , has grown over time , it can be too easy to say , \u201c So what ?\n\u201d After all , those numbers don \u2019 t really tell you how much better ( or worse ) off someone really is .\nAnd things can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salaries and prices .\nTo avoid all of this , Pooley and Tupy use the neat trick of translating wages and the cost of various goods into \u201c time prices \u201d \u2014figuring out how long someone would have to work in order to make a purchase at a given time .\nTo take a simple example , Pooley and Tupy calculate that , a quarter century ago , an unskilled worker in the U.S. earned $ 7.49 an hour .\nAt that time , 1997 , a 42-inch LCD TV sold for $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have to work about 2,000 hours ( or 40 hours a week for 50 weeks ) to make that purchase .\nBy 2019 , the average unskilled worker earned $ 13.66 an hour and ( far better ) 42-inch TVs cost $ 148 .\nIn other words , 11 hours would now pay for the purchase that , 25 years ago , would \u2019 ve required a year of work .\nTVs are a pretty banal example , but Pooley and Tupy offer rafts of others , including breakfast , pickup trucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , air conditioning , and so on .\nAnd when you look at the differences over much longer spans of time , the results start to get truly eye-popping .\nIn other words , even as the population has exploded\u2014nationally and around the globe\u2014we \u2019 ve experienced a growing abundance of , well , pretty much every good and service you can imagine .\nRemarkably , that \u2019 s been true not only in the U.S. , but throughout much of the world .\nPooley and Tupy discuss the forces responsible , pointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d assumptions by engaging in free , cooperative trade and embracing ( even disruptive ) innovation .\nThey note the importance of adopting silver as a common currency , for instance , explaining , \u201c For the first time in history there was a universal means of exchange .\nThat removed the need to barter in long-distance trade , making trade much easier and more profitable.\n\u201d They note that trade liberalization \u201c allowed industrialization to spread globally .\nTrade volumes rose , costs fell , and , as reflected in the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d America \u2019 s current ailments and shortcomings are part of the truth .\nBut so , too , is grasping the extraordinary abundance that today \u2019 s youth have inherited\u2014and that even a family of modest means in 2022 has access to transportation , communications , health care , plumbing , food , and entertainment that would \u2019 ve exceeded the wildest dreams of a Renaissance monarch .\nOh , and understanding the forces that helped produce these gifts is , also , part of \u201c teaching the truth.\n\u201d In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot easier to take \u201c teach the truth \u201d at face value if the self-proclaimed truthers seemed more interested in exploring the whole truth , even the bits that don \u2019 t comport with their

"title": "Constitution Day: Liberty Once Lost May be Lost Forever", "content": "Constitution Day , which falls on September 17 , is the national observance holiday that most Americans have never heard of .\nYet this year , 2022 , it may well be our most important holiday to understand , for almost all our most pressing national problems today are a result of corruption and departure from governance and law enforcement consistent with the Constitution .\nAs a result , our country is threatened more now than at any time since seven southern states seceded from the Union and Civil War broke out on April 12 , 1861 .\nTo understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going back in time to appreciate how the Constitution was conceived as both the founding and governing instrument for the United States government .\nThe War of Independence lasted five long years from 1776 to 1781 , with the impoverished , underfunded , underequipped , and undertrained Continental army being mostly on the defensive .\nIt was a miracle that this relatively small American militia could defeat Great Britain \u2014 then the most formidable military power in the world .\nThe second miracle in forming the United States was the drafting of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and decisive military victory over the British at Yorktown in 1781 .\nBy contemporary standards , it is inconceivable how delegates from thirteen extraordinarily disparate states could muster the forbearance and magnanimity to agree on the terms of a new Constitution after only four months of deliberation .\nWith God \u2019 s help they accomplished the impossible .\nAs good as that Constitution was , it had to be ratified by the states to become the law of the land .\nAnd several states withheld support out of fear the Constitution did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overreach and corruption of federal government power .\nThe hold-out influential and large states \u2014 notably Virginia , New York , and Massachusetts \u2014 finally agreed to ratify the Constitution on the condition that ten amendments called the Bill of Rights would be incorporated into the final Constitution .\nThis Bill of Rights would define and protect both the people \u2019 s natural and unalienable rights and also the separate states \u2019 rights against the abuse of federal government power .\nThe Declaration of Independence and the Constitution were revolutionary political doctrines because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established that these rights came from God and not the state .\nThese rights being then sovereign and unalienable made the people in charge and government \u2019 s role subordinate \u2014 not the other way around .\nAnother aspect of the Constitution was that it limited government abuse by creating checks and balances of power between three separate branches of government \u2014 the executive , the legislative , and the judicial .\nAnother mechanism of check in the Constitution was also to delineate power to be exercised between the federal and state governing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution provided yet another important mechanism to limit the extent and duration of government incompetence and corruption .\nThis also meant that the most sacred responsibility of citizenship established by the Constitution was and is the right of the people to vote and decide who shall govern .\nThis combination of limiting governmental power and maximizing peoples \u2019 rights makes the U.S. Constitution unique \u2014 the longest-running constitutional democratic republic in human history .\nNevertheless , when determined and dishonest people manipulate elections to fix outcomes to install people who can be compromised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any constitution can be fundamentally undermined and circumvented , causing disaster for the people .\nWe can now see the results of political corruption that has undermined the Constitution all around us , the scope of which we have never seen before in America \u2019 s 239-year history : \u2022 a record number of undocumented and illegal immigrants , criminals and terrorists pouring over our southern border daily .\n\u2022 the defunding of police and wholesale increase in crime .\n\u2022 The inexplicable turnover of $ 80 billion in advanced U.S. military equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Afghanistan .\n\u2022 the censorship and deplatforming of independent voices in the legacy and social media .\n\u2022 the increase of government control of media narratives .\n\u2022 the political weaponization of law enforcement agencies against people protesting school boards , questioning election integrity , or researching the patterns of vote fraud and polling irregularities .\nHow can anyone not see that this outcome is anything other than an orchestrated effort to subvert and destroy the Constitutional Republic of America ?\nThe Constitution makes it clear that everyone \u2014 whether in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal before the law .\nAdditionally , every elected federal government officeholder , judicial appointee , and executive branch cabinet secretary is required to pledge an oath before assuming office , to \u201c support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies , foreign and domestic.\n\u201d Yet today everyone can see that application and compliance with the law is blatantly unequal and has become so bad that our country resembles a banana republic .\nAnd the betrayal of the oath of office appears to be widespread in our government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s personal residence at Mar-a-Lago was raided by the FBI for alleged possession of classified documents .\nBut President Barack Obama and quid-pro-quo Hillary Clinton never had their personal residences raided , although we learned directly from then-FBI director James Comey , that the unsecure inter net server located at Hillary \u2019 s residence with full knowledge of Barack Obama ( who communicated with Hillary with a decoy email address ) had classified information passing through it .\nNow let \u2019 s face our present predicament with the present White House resident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is blatantly and willfully violating the oath of office that he swore to uphold , violating the very First Amendment which is the most important because it protects all the others .\nThe First Amendment specifically gives the right to free speech and \u201c the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\n\u201d Biden has not only breached this right of the people but has done it in a manner that no prior president has done \u2014 announcing he would even amp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In his September 1st speech , staged for effect in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia , complete with a blood-red backdrop , the flanking of military guards , and a delivery reminiscent of Hitler \u2019 s militant gestures at the Third Reich podium , Biden repeatedly disparaged supporters of Donald Trump \u2019 s MAGA movement \u2014 that represents about half the voting population of the United States .\nHis condemnation of anyone who questioned the honesty and legitimacy of the 2020 elections \u2014 even suggesting that such people are \u201c threats to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panic about the 2020 election fraud discovery evidence , which \u2014 being collected for nearly two years \u2014 is now copious and undeniable .\nAbout a week later on September 9 , Biden delivered on his threat .\nBiden \u2019 s Justice Department served thirty-five people considered close to Trump and his MAGA movement , requesting documents and communication dating from a month before the 2020 election until a month or two months after the election .\nThe specific search is targeted at discovery regarding all people falling into such categories as alternate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the January 6 Capitol protest .\nThe unconstitutional intimidation tactics have continued .\nOn September 14 , Mike Lindell , aka the Pillow-man whose cause celebre is the restoration of honest elections , was tracked down and boxed in a restaurant parking lot by three FBI vehicles , served with a search warrant , and then had his cellphone seized .\nThe following day , a colleague of Lindell , Dr. Douglas G. Frank , a Ph.D. a scientist in electrochemistry who has developed expertise in algorithm modeling pertaining to voting machines \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to scientifically demonstrate how those said electronic machines can be repeatedly and remotely manipulated to flip votes \u2014 experienced the same fate as Lindell .\nOn September 15 , the day after Lindell \u2019 s apprehension by the FBI , he was also served with an FBI warrant and had his cell phone seized .\nNow , as people have digested the unprecedented FBI raid on President Trump \u2019 s personal residence at Mar-a-Lago and all the subsequent FBI harassment and raids , what do we the people do about this unparalleled abuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nMany who find this shocking are also confronted with a realization that we now have more in common with banana republics than constitutional democracies and that we are too close for comfort to completely losing this country to arbitrary rule and tyranny .\nThe patriots \u2019 answer must be to keep perspective , avoid any temptation or inclination to take up arms , overcome and wait out every false flag October surprise , volunteer to help get the vote out , demand that elections be held no matter what , serve to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and show up to vote in overwhelming numbers on November 8 .", "author": "Scott S.

students in the state the opportunity to receive $ 7,000 in an Empowerment Scholarship Account .\nStudents can apply the annual funds to cover expenses of the learning avenue of choice \u2014 private school , microschool , learning pod , homeschool , virtual school , hybrid , or a host of other expenses such as tutoring , curriculum , technology , or other learning supplies .\nNot only is this a win for parents , whose children can now be freed from government-run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u2019 s also a win for the state .\nBy employing free market principles to the K-12 education enterprise , customers are empowered to shop for schools and other innovative educational avenues for their children .\nThis will transform the public-school monopoly into a competitive marketplace .\nFor the first time on a statewide scale , K-12 schools will be forced to demonstrate that they provide high-quality student learning and a superior customer experience , all with a competitive price to attract and retain students .\nParents dissatisfied with their child \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2014 can simply exit and take their $ 7,000 per student Empowerment Scholarship Account funding elsewhere .\nAs Robert J .\nMarks explains in his book , Non-Computable You : What You Do that Artificial Intelligence Never Will , free market forces inspire people to innovate .\nWith education entrepreneurs \u2014 termed \u201c edupreneurs \u201d \u2014 creating innovative schooling avenues for students , parents will have the ability to select from an increasing array of options .\nThese new schools , new school models , and innovative learning avenues will come on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edupreneurs compete to meet the market demand .\nEdupreneurs will have a leg up on entrepreneurs in other industries by knowing potential consumers have $ 7,000 per student set aside to buy what they \u2019 re selling .\nTherefore , they can create business models working backward from that number to help meet the instant large-scale demand at a price consumers can pay .\nOfferings can range from full-service in-person private schools to more innovative and flexible models that provide instruction in less traditional ways .\nWith a wide variety of $ 7,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , providers will be motivated to attract customers with superior offerings in the most cost-effective way .\nThis will be a far cry from today \u2019 s K-12 public school monopoly that demands more money every year with little accountability for student learning nor providing a positive customer experience for families .\nVoters will be exposed to non-traditional public schools with the consistent ability to effectively educate students with fewer funds .\nAnd gone will be the days of perpetual annual increases in K-12 public school funding .\nAs of 2022 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , state , and local \u2014 averages $ 10,790 per student .\nWith the new competition , public schools will , for the first time in history , be held responsible for justifying why they need $ 3,790 more per student than their alternative K-12 education providers .\nAdditionally , the savings to the state will be enormous \u2014 each student exiting the public system will reduce the state \u2019 s required revenue from $ 10,790 to $ 7,000 .\nNo longer will the annual revenue in Arizona for K-12 education topple $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market share shrinks , so will the teacher unions \u2019 political stronghold , which places the interests of teachers and the promotion of far-left political agendas above the education needs of students .\nFewer students will equate to fewer teachers and , in turn , a significant drop in union member dues \u2014 resulting in lower donations to Democratic political candidates , weakening their political power .\nEnormous benefits will ensue for states implementing universal school choice as Arizona has done .\nA better prepared workforce will result in significant economic benefits for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Students entering adulthood will be better equipped to become employed contributors to their communities while providing for themselves and their families , rather than becoming a drain on government financial services for the balance of their adult lives , which will save the state significantly .\nAdditionally , universal school choice will attract workers from other states who want to experience similar educational freedom for their children , thereby alleviating any state worker shortages and boosting their economy .\nIncreased competition for jobs will also result in stronger productivity and profit for companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will also be consumers of housing , food , goods , and services in their new state .\nFurthermore , educated and gainfully employed adults are far less likely to commit crimes or suffer a myriad of other far-reaching negative effects for themselves , their families , and their communities .\nThe bottom line is that no other strategic plan can benefit a state more than implementing universal school choice .\nWith Arizona making the leap first , other states will look on with watchful eyes and take notes .\nWe may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with

decline in civility and growing mob behavior .\nFundamental and deep division prevents government from fixing itself .\nBut we the people can and must play a decisive role in turning things around .\nIn fact , a country with a Constitution that makes us a nation of the people , by the people and for the people , puts the real power in the hands of voters rather than the elites in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in giving the power to the people , the Founders had no illusions about everyday Americans .\nThey recognized that most citizens would not have the time or interest to understand the details of domestic economic policy or foreign policy .\nBut they were confident in the common sense of the people , and that people would vote for candidates and political parties with more likelihood of delivering solutions to improve their lives .\nThey also hoped that national elections scheduled every two years would provide an important check on irresponsibility and abuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corruption in a new presidential administration can be recognized early on , which is why midterm elections are the key mechanism for course correction when there are problems in any such new administration .\nVoters need only ask themselves am I better or worse off today than I was two years ago .\nIf the answer this year is a resounding , \u201c I am worse off than I was two years ago , \u201d they should vote against the party in power \u2014 the Democrat Party .\nMidterm elections are particularly important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and direct way to change course by electing new candidates from the opposing party in such numbers that they become the new majority , which can then stop executive branch malfeasance .\nTo get a sense of the gravity of our present situation , let us revisit 10 developments that have happened to America since the Biden administration took power less than two years ago , acknowledging that all these were preventable : \u2022 Biden \u2019 s open border policy has resulted in a record number of undocumented and illegal immigrants , criminals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gangs crossing the U.S. southern border .\nBreitbart News puts that number at 5 million , and more than 150,000 Americans have died from illegal trafficking of fentanyl during this time .\n\u2022 The wholesale increase in crime in America has largely resulted from Democrat polices that have defunded the police .\n\u2022 Joe Biden signed executive orders to stop oil pipelines and reduce drilling and hydrocarbon extraction \u2014 resulting in significantly higher energy prices , a need for importing oil from undesirable states , and the loss of energy independence achieved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u2022 The Biden administration \u2019 s failure to alleviate supply chain problems and its energy policies resulting in sharp fuel price increases became driving factors in our nation \u2019 s present runaway inflation .\n\u2022 A demoralized military under Biden has caused recruiting shortfalls across all the services , and a botched military withdrawal that precipitated an inexplicable turnover of $ 80 billion in advanced U.S. military equipment to our terrorist enemy , the Taliban , in Afghanistan brought dishonor and disrespect to the United States .\n\u2022 Biden has expressed no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 191,000 acres of U.S. farmland , including land in the vicinity of U.S. missile silos and military installations , and 300 acres near the Grand Forks , North Dakota , Space Force Base that operates our most advanced drone airframes and satellite communication technology .\n\u2022 The Biden administration has engaged in aiding and abetting censorship and deplatforming of independent voices in the legacy and social media .\n\u2022 The Biden administration \u2019 s extension of government influence and control of media narratives are in direct violation of the First Amendment .\n\u2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconsistent and often harmful policies censored preventive treatments for COVID-19 , while making recommendations and extending mandates that destroyed businesses , denied children access to socialization and learning , and caused unprecedented deaths and injuries .\n\u2022 The Biden administration has politically weaponized the Justice Department and law enforcement agencies in unprecedented ways manifest in raids against the homes of people exercising their First Amendment rights in protesting school boards , abortion , questioning election integrity and researching the patterns of vote fraud and electronic vote counting irregularities .\nJust a few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Trump \u2019 s personal residence at Mar-a-Lago , the IRS announced that it was hiring 87,000 new agents , a move that not only would double the agency \u2019 s present size , but make the IRS larger than the Pentagon , the State Department , the FBI and the Customs and Border Control combined .\nSuch an enlargement of the IRS makes little sense , until one connects the dots with the factual record .\nThe IRS has stockpiled some 5 million rounds of ammunition , continues to acquire more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new hires experienced and/or willing to be trained in the handling of firearms .\nIn September , there have been raids , seizures of phones , computers and records and the serving of subpoenas and/or search warrants on some 50 high-level Trump supporters .\nCollectively , these actions over that last several months suggest that United States is closer to a police state than a constitutional democracy .\nAmericans couldn \u2019 t have a clearer clarion to wake up and take action by voting , while also resisting inclination to retaliate or take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There will be various false flag events as we approach the November 8 election day , with the intention of creating civil disturbances that would justify martial law and provide justification for election postponement or promotion of another mail-in/ballot harvesting fiasco .\nNone of these can be allowed to happen .\nIt \u2019 s important for patriotic Americans to do three things in addition to voting .\nFirst , they must try to educate friends and family who may not understand what is going on and may not understand the stakes and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course correction .\nSecond , they should volunteer to serve at the polling places and vote counting and processing places to discourage vote fraud and irregularities .\nThird , and most important , it is important to pray for God \u2019 s will to be done in America .\nII Chronicles 7:14 , reminds us of hope for all times : \u201c If My people who are called by My name will humble themselves , and pray and seek My face , and turn from their wicked ways , then I will hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sin and heal their land .\n\u201d", "author": "Scott S.

or cremation are touted by their boosters as \u201c green , \u201d meaning fewer global warming emissions generated than cremating , none of the toxic chemicals used in embalming , and no taking up space in a graveyard that could be used by the living .\nThey may also be far less expensive than traditional mortuary services , which is certainly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u2019 s my age , but I can \u2019 t help feeling disquieted by these non-funeral trends .\nOn the one hand , I suppose one could say , what does it matter ?\nAshes to ashes , dust to dust , dirt to dirt , sewage to sewage : Bodies must be processed .\nBut on the other , there \u2019 s something ultimately diminishing about grandpa in a flowerpot .\nIndeed , it seems to me that these methods to unceremoniously eradicate the body convey a powerful symbolic message that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atoms gathered temporarily in a rational and animated form .\nSince life doesn \u2019 t ultimately matter in the material scheme of things , what difference does it make whether we bury , burn , liquify , or compost what are , after all , merely inanimate flesh and bones ?\nCorpses are that to be sure\u2014but that isn \u2019 t all they are .\nHuman dignity matters even after we die .\nThat \u2019 s why law and tradition require that corpses be handled with respect .\nFor example , it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bodies of enemy combatants .\nHaving sex with a cadaver is a serious crime .\nGrave and cemetery vandalization are illegal and viewed as violating something sacred .\nWe cover the remains of people who just died to preserve their privacy\u2014even though the dead are quite beyond awareness of being exposed .\nIn these and myriad other ways , we accord our deceased respect not accorded to the bodies of animals .\nIt \u2019 s a way to honor their lives and our shared humanity .\nAs an ultimate example , look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Queen Elizabeth II \u2019 s funeral was to millions of people around the world .\nImagine the different sense that would have been conveyed if her remains had merely been poured into London \u2019 s water treatment system .\nHow diminishing would that have been to the essence of what she represented ?\nIn this sense , these novel means of disposition shatter the continuity of human existence .\nThe author and moral thinker Joseph Bottum got me thinking about this issue several years ago in an essay about the increasing popularity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d writing , \u201c The modern failure of funerals serves as both a cause and a symptom of the shattering of culture , first into the nuclear family , then into atomized individuals , and at last into nothingness \u2026 where the dead are abandoned without ceremony in deliberately unmarked graves , or their corpses are cremated with the ashes spread across large and indifferent spaces.\n\u201d Bottum is saying that with the loss of graves and urn niches\u2014and surely , by pouring remains into the sewer\u2014we deprive ourselves of connecting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the past to us , but also for those who will live in the future , with us .\nThat \u2019 s why ancient graveyards exert a poignant force , and we may grow emotional at the endless rows of headstones in large Veterans Cemeteries .\nMore intimately , many find great meaning or comfort in visiting the graves of their loved ones or forebears .\nI have experienced this in a personal way .\nMy maternal grandfather died decades before I was born .\nBeing able to visit his grave made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my familial roots .\nHad he been disposed of anonymously he would always have been a mere abstraction .\nTreating the dead with great respect also reflects the belief that our importance continues even after we die .\nReligionists believe that there is more to come beyond the grave , and that how we live has a direct impact on that future existence .\nThis hope is reflected in funeral ceremonies and other death memorials .\nIn contrast , these new means of disposition may reflect a profoundly\u2014and in my view , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we view both the importance of life and the meaning of death .\nAt its most reductionist , materialists insist our lives have no ultimate meaning .\nTurning human bodies into so much sewage certainly would seem to reflect that view .\nIn this regard , why not go all-in for efficiency , as in the dystopian movie \u201c Soylent Green \u2019 s classic climactic utterance , \u201c Soylent Green is people !\n\u201d ?\nHyperbole aside , I \u2019 m not arguing that composting and liquefication be banned .\nPeople should normally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest in the way they want so long as it \u2019 s safe and hygienic\u2014which , ironically , respects the persons they once were .\nI want to be buried without embalming in a simple wooden coffin as my Eastern Orthodox Christian tradition directs .\nIf I want my preferences respected , I have to honor the wishes of those who think differently from me .\nBut I do worry : If our remains come to be perceived as merely so much waste to be disposed of as quickly and efficiently as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widespread belief that we

there is no accountability within the system and no repercussions if they fail to educate children effectively .\nToday , our K-12 public schools are failing 77 % of our children .\nThat \u2019 s the percentage of children who are not academically proficient averaged across core subjects after 13 years of schooling based upon NAEP data .\nFor most of the country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supply and compensation of teachers .\nMoreover , union contracts control virtually every aspect of operating a school , including the hours worked , the yearly calendar , and daily working conditions .\nThere is no career ladder \u2014 only a \u201c step and lane \u201d salary schedule based on seniority and educational level .\nThus , there is no incentive for strong professional performance .\nIn fact , some of our worst teachers can be some of our highest paid if they \u2019 ve been in the profession for enough years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language pertaining to student achievement .\nInstead , the contracts deal only with adults .\nAs a result , our government schools are adult-focused rather than student-focused .\nAnd being the largest employer in the country , our K-12 public education system is more an employment program than an education system .\nThe union monopoly is a major reason why .\nThe third monopoly in our education system is the colleges of education within universities , which were established to ensure that only \u201c qualified \u201d teachers could work in the classroom .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ensured higher quality teachers .\nBut the reality is that \u201c qualified \u201d means only that students spend four years in an education college ( or a non-traditional program offered in some states ) .\nAnd , as the certification laws have driven the proliferation of education colleges over time , their performance has declined , as has that of the state \u2019 s non-traditional programs .\nColleges of education have grown to where we now have nearly 2,000 teacher preparation providers within higher education institutions that grant teaching certificates \u2014 institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers .\nThe quality of these colleges varies , but the vast majority of these programs do not effectively screen poor teaching candidates .\nConsequently , graduates of these programs are officially certified regardless of their ability to teach .\nThe certification process is fundamentally flawed .\nIn essence , 18-year-olds are given four years of training concerning how to teach content rather than taking content experts and equipping them with skills needed to teach .\nIt \u2019 s all backwards .\nToday , we get excellent teaching by accident , not by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we want to improve the academic achievement of our students .\nThe same is true for leadership , as most states require principals and superintendents to be certified , which can usually only occur through a college of education .\nIn short , the monopoly of education colleges has diminished the supply of competent teachers and leaders in our schools .\nMonopolies rarely perform well , and our K-12 public schools are no exception .\nIf we are serious about the effective education of our children , we need to break down these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFirst , parents must be empowered to decide how , when , and where they want their children educated .\nIf we employ free-market principles to give parents the ability to choose the best school for their children , schools will be forced to dramatically improve or lose their market share .\nSecond , we need to break the teacher union stronghold by electing champions of education freedom with the political will to stand up to unions .\nThird , we should expand the pipeline for teachers , principals , and superintendents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleges .\nArizona and Tennessee are two states leading the way in this change .\nBy shifting the power from the state , the union , and the colleges of education to the parents , the winners will be America \u2019 s children .", "author": "Donald Nielsen", "url": "https://www.discovery.org/a/the-monopolies-of-education/", "published": "Mon, 26 Sep 2022 18:08:00

"content": "Today \u2019 s woke perspective condemns Columbus Day as an unworthy holiday .\nHowever , a circumspect understanding of history offers numerous reasons why Columbus should not only be celebrated , but also why his qualities of character make him an exemplary figure worthy of emulation for all time .\nFirst , it \u2019 s ironic that criticism of Columbus Day emanates from the left in America for Columbus never set foot on or even saw any territory that later became part of the continental United States .\nColumbus \u2019 four expeditions to the New World between 1492 and 1504 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territories which are now Latin America .\nA primary legacy of Columbus was that in discovering the New World , he opened the door to exploration and colonization of those new territories by Europeans who followed .\nChristopher Columbus was less controversial and more consequential than many other important historical figures .\nHe embodied a range of attributes that are necessary for solving many of our contemporary problems and actually saving our country from further decline and collapse resulting from abandoning God , group think , corruption and abuse of power .\nColumbus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his life was punctuated by hardship , failures , and near death that would have been the demise of most ordinary people .\nIf he had not been a man of character and determination with deep faith in God , self-confidence to ignore critics , and go against the crowd and remain steadfast in his vision and his calling , he never could have accomplished what he did , which was of course the discovery of the New World in the Western Hemisphere .\nColumbus left behind voluminous ship logs , diaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do what he did .\nBorn and raised in Genoa , Italy , he was the consummate self-made man who shipped out at an early age .\nExperiencing the militant face of Islam at the eastern end of the Mediterranean that created a blockade to Europe \u2019 s important trade with the Orient , he felt God \u2019 s conviction to find a western sea route , knowing it would have far-reaching benefits .\nColumbus faced death when the Flemish-flagged ship on which he was crew was attacked and sunk off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determination to survive he was able to find floating debris that enabled him to kick his way to shore .\nFor a seafarer with his ambition and vision , there was no better country on which to wash up than Portugal , a nation with the world \u2019 s most advanced tools of navigation and map-making .\nThere he learned about celestial navigation , which further confirmed his confidence to sail west \u201c around \u201d the world to India and the Spice Islands .\nBy his late thirties , his \u201c calling \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c It was the Lord who put into my mind , [ and ] I could feel his hand upon me\u2026that it would be possible to sail from here to the Indies.\n\u201d Recognizing that such an undertaking would need state sponsorship , Columbus spent the next six years traipsing across Europe seeking support from sovereignties of the leading maritime countries , only to find rejection and ridicule .\nQueen Isabella and King Ferdinand of Spain had turned down Columbus several times .\nBut because of his seafaring skills , conviction about finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and willingness to lead an armed flotilla to rescue the Church of the Holy Sepulchre from Muslim hands in the eastern Mediterranean , they had a change of heart toward Columbus .\nFew years in history have been punctuated by such pivotal events as what happened in 1492 .\nIt was in that year that Christendom\u2014still suffering from the loss of Constantinople to the Muslim Turks 40 years prior\u2014drove Islam out of Spain and Europe with Isabella and Ferdinand playing the pivotal role .\nThey then decided to support Christian expansion and finance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn his first voyage of three ships\u2014the Nina , Pinta and Santa Maria\u2014after being at sea for two months Columbus faced an anxious crew , who believed landfall should have been made by week five .\nThe situation became mutinous with threats to heave Columbus overboard if he did not agree to their demands to turn back .\nRecognizing that he alone could hardly restrain let alone punish his mutinous crew of some fifty , Columbus turned to God .\nIn a letter that has been preserved among his personal historical records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a deal with his Spanish crew and stake his life on it .\nHe asked for three more days , and if land was not sighted , the crew could do with him as they wished .\nAs providence would have it , in the early morning hours of the third day on October 12 , under the light of the moon and the stars , the lookout from the ship Pinta , shouted out the siting of land .\nAssuming it was an island to the east of India or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was about to discover a new part of the world\u2014the outskirts of a massive continent\u2014far from the Orient .\nToday \u2019 s woke culture , which has held Columbus accountable for the chain of disasters that followed in his wake in the Caribbean and South America is not only unfair , but it overlooks the essence of the man .\nNot of Spanish culture , Columbus was at heart a simple but ambitious individualist\u2014a seafaring explorer and evangelist .\nHe had neither interest in founding colonies nor was he an effective leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting up colonial outposts at the behest of Isabella .\nColumbus \u2019 s perseverance and courage in his transatlantic crossing inspired successors from northern Europe who had been transformed by the Protestant Reformation with the ideas of equality and freedom .\nThey would set out to pursue a new life in that New World , ultimately establishing thirteen different colonies in coastal North America .\nSuffering injustice from Great Britain many years later , those colonists reluctantly banded together to fight for independence .\nOver the six years of the Revolutionary War , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut like the course of Columbus , George Washington \u2019 s persistence , courage and faith in God empowered an underequipped and underfunded colonial army to get to final victory and achieve independence .\nThat in turn enabled the founding of a new nation , unlike any other\u2014one based on the revolutionary idea that people \u2019 s life , liberty , and pursuit of happiness were inviolable because those rights came from God and not man or the state .\nSeen from the big picture , Columbus Day is worth keeping and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founding a new nation unencumbered by past corruption and for the simple reason that it celebrates beliefs and qualities of character that would be foundational to America .\nIt could even be said that Columbus Day is the holiday that commemorates the character , attitudes and choice of human action that made the other American holidays possible .", "author": "Scott S.

.\nThe first is commonly known as \u201c brain death , \u201d which involves the irreversible cessation of the whole brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second method is sometimes called \u201c heart death , \u201d meaning irreversible cardiac arrest .\nNotice that the keyword in declaring death in either case is \u201c irreversible.\n\u201d If the heart stops but can be started again\u2014as happens routinely in open heart surgery\u2014the patient isn \u2019 t dead .\nIf the seemingly inert brain can still recover function , the patient remains alive .\nIn this way , the dead can be declared deceased , but the still-living won \u2019 t be pushed out of the lifeboat until all hope for survival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgeons have been blurring these crucial moral boundaries by restarting donors \u2019 hearts after a planned cardiac arrest ( when life-sustaining treatment is withdrawn ) and clamping off blood flow to the brain to cause brain death so that beating hearts can be harvested .\nKnown as \u201c normothermic regional perfusion with controlled donation after circulatory death \u201d ( NRP-cDCD ) , the procedure is quietly being tested or implemented across the country .\nThis is a terrible mistake .\nIf a patient is resuscitated after cardiac arrest , the person isn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the brain to cause brain death thereafter seems awfully close to reviving the patient and then killing him .\nThis isn \u2019 t only immoral\u2014and arguably illegal as a violation of the DDR\u2014but it also represents another in a long series of violations that have bred so much public distrust in institutions .\nYou know what I mean : A controversial policy is instituted with the assurance by \u201c the experts \u201d that \u201c strict guidelines \u201d will protect against abuse\u2014only for those boundaries to be violated or stretched beyond recognition once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such public policy promise-breaking has become so ubiquitous that one is tempted to believe that all such assurances are merely ruses to allow \u201c the experts \u201d to do whatever they want .\nAllowing doctors to restart hearts in order to induce brain death calls into question the sincerity of transplant medical ethics .\nThankfully , some in organized medicine\u2014such as the American College of Physicians\u2014are resisting this new approach to organ gathering .\nBut the process seems to be expanding , with new hospitals instituting NRP-cDCD protocols on an ongoing basis .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general public to weigh in and say , \u201c This must stop !\n\u201d Some lines should never be crossed .\nAllowing doctors to kill patients during organ harvesting wouldn \u2019 t only be an acute threat to the sanctity of life , but I can think of no better way to sow mistrust in our health care system generally\u2014and the lifesaving field of organ transplant medicine specifically .\nReducing living patients to so many organ farms ripe for the harvest isn \u2019 t only blatantly

of falling enrollment .\nIt is not only an economic debacle , but student learning is plummeting during the spending spree .\nIn the fall of 2020 , more than three million students around the country did not show up to school \u2014 a half million of those were kindergarten students whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their non-reading five-year-old children .\nThen by the spring of 2021 , public school enrollment decline grew to four million students \u2014 a staggering 9 % decrease .\nThe mass exodus is not slowing as the 2022-2023 school year is underway .\nThe consistent trend of students who have departed K-12 public schools over the past three school years is that they are not coming back .\nParents and students are witnessing firsthand the benefits of alternative educational avenues , such as private schools , homeschooling , microschools , learning pods , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience , the only aspect they miss from K-12 public schools is that they are \u201c free \u201d thanks to the heavy taxes extracted from all .\nEven with the sharp enrollment decline , staffing levels have remained level or even increased .\nIn no industry , other than government , are staffing levels maintained in the face of significant and ongoing customer decline .\nDownsizing is inevitable .\nBut in K-12 education , in large part by the powerful teacher unions who are teamed up with Democrat policymakers , claims of understaffing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAs a case in point , the Seattle Public Schools ( SPS ) employs more than 7,000 adults , which translates to one employee for every seven students .\nDespite SPS \u2019 s seven-and-a-half percent enrollment downturn , it has not paused plans to hire additional employees .\nWith only 47 % of the district \u2019 s employees operating as classroom teachers , the excessive staffing drives up the cost to taxpayers , equating to $ 22,200 per student without factoring in the capital budget funding .\nSPS is far from alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrinking student enrollment numbers and less than stellar results to show for it .\nIn 2021 , the Los Angeles Unified School District passed a $ 13.8 billion operating budget for the 2021-2022 school year , a 62 % increase over the prior year \u2019 s budget .\nThe increase skyrocketed the per student spending to $ 24,000 \u2014 a more than $ 7,000 increase within three years .\nThe same reality is true for New York City Public Schools .\nThe largest public school district in the country chalked up $ 30,772 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enrollment dropped 9.5 % .\nSPS recently agreed to a new three-year contract with the Seattle Education Association adding approximately 20 % to the budget for primarily more pay and increased staffing .\nYet their Superintendent , Brent Jones , admits the district doesn \u2019 t have the money for the $ 228 million agreed-upon increase .\nSo where does this money come from to close the funding gap \u2014 more accurately described as the planned overspending deficit ?\nTaxpayers , of course .\nSchools operate an overstaffing model , ignoring enrollment downturns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the education system is underfunded , which pulls on the heartstrings of lawmakers and voters .\nIt \u2019 s hard to argue against the emotional ruse claiming that \u201c If you care about kids and your community , you \u2019 ll vote in favor of fully funding public schools.\n\u201d In this narrative , no regard is given to the poor management of personnel nor the bloated school district bureaucracy and staff rosters .\nFurthermore , there is no accountability for more money consistently failing to improve student learning .\nNationally , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 135 adults for every 1,000 students , which is 7.4 adults per student \u2014 similar to the SPS number .\nIn the early 1950s , the ratio was more than 17 students per adult .\nSince personnel costs are the largest school operational budget line item , it \u2019 s no surprise that there are annual demands for increased funding , even as more money is poured into the system .\nPut another way , there are four times as many administrators in our K-12 public education system than in the 1950s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the funding before it even has the chance to reach the classroom .\nNewark , New Jersey , provides a typical example of this inefficiency \u2014 the school administration absorbs more than $ 10,000 of the $ 20,000 spent per student .\nAnd when the funds finally reach the classroom level , there is little positive impact for students because much of the money is gobbled up by teacher salaries , robust benefits packages , and lavish pensions \u2014 which teacher unions continue to champion as insufficient no matter how large .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools are underfunded and understaffed , don \u2019 t fall for it .\nWashington State public schools average about $ 119,000 per year in salary and benefits for a nine-month work year compared to the statewide average compensation of roughly $ 56,600 , which in most cases is a 12-month position .\nAnd as we continue to pour more money and additional staff into the K-12 public education system , student learning performance over the past several decades has not improved .\nOn the contrary , student outcomes have remained flat despite enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s time we stop the absurdity and redesign U.S. K-12 education to ensure that funding follows students , and parents are empowered to select the education avenue that will best serve their children .\nThe resulting free market education landscape based on choice and competition would force schools to educate students more effectively and cost-efficiently or lose students and ultimately go out of business .\nTaxpayers , parents , and community

patients thought to be unconscious were actually awake .\nAn earlier study pegged that number as up to 40 percent . )\nClaiming that unconscious patients couldn \u2019 t be harmed would also mean that they wouldn \u2019 t be wronged by , say , being raped , since they would have no continuing interest in their body \u2019 s integrity .\nAnd since , under Smith \u2019 s value system , we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organs , why not also experiment on their bodies ?\nAfter all , their moral value would be reduced to that of yeast .\nWhat \u2019 s that you say ?\nWho cares what bioethicists write in their arcane professional journals ?\nWe all should .\nBioethical discourse isn \u2019 t akin to barstool philosophizing .\nWhat starts in the Journal of Medical Ethics , The New England Journal of Medicine , the Hastings Center Report , the Journal of the American Medical Association , and other such publications often has a real-world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often an early step in the creation of public health law .\nFirst , \u201c the experts \u201d argue back and forth about policies they would like to see enacted .\nOnce a rough consensus is reached , many of these proposals are legislated into law or imposed bureaucratically via regulation .\nSometimes , they become official policy by way of litigation in which bioethicists testify about what \u201c the experts \u201d believe and a judge enacts their ideas in court rulings .\nAs a clear example , this is precisely the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transgendered children to have their puberties blocked or be subjected to \u201c gender-affirming \u201d surgeries .\nKilling for Organs May Already Be Happening Killing for organs may have already leaped from advocacy to implementation by blurring the line between what \u2019 s called \u201c brain death \u201d and \u201c heart death.\n\u201d Dead is dead , we might say , but there are two approaches to declaring that a life has ended .\nThe first is commonly known as \u201c brain death , \u201d which involves the irreversible cessation of the whole brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second method is sometimes called \u201c heart death , \u201d meaning irreversible cardiac arrest .\nNotice that the keyword in declaring death in either case is \u201c irreversible.\n\u201d If the heart stops but can be started again\u2014as happens routinely in open heart surgery\u2014the patient isn \u2019 t dead .\nIf the seemingly inert brain can still recover function , the patient remains alive .\nIn this way , the dead can be declared deceased , but the still-living won \u2019 t be pushed out of the lifeboat until all hope for survival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgeons have been blurring these crucial moral boundaries by restarting donors \u2019 hearts after a planned cardiac arrest ( when life-sustaining treatment is withdrawn ) and clamping off blood flow to the brain to cause brain death so that beating hearts can be harvested .\nKnown as \u201c normothermic regional perfusion with controlled donation after circulatory death \u201d ( NRP-cDCD ) , the procedure is quietly being tested or implemented across the country .\nThis is a terrible mistake .\nIf a patient is resuscitated after cardiac arrest , the person isn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the brain to cause brain death thereafter seems awfully close to reviving the patient and then killing him .\nThis isn \u2019 t only immoral\u2014and arguably illegal as a violation of the DDR\u2014but it also represents another in a long series of violations that have bred so much public distrust in institutions .\nYou know what I mean : A controversial policy is instituted with the assurance by \u201c the experts \u201d that \u201c strict guidelines \u201d will protect against abuse\u2014only for those boundaries to be violated or stretched beyond recognition once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such public policy promise-breaking has become so ubiquitous that one is tempted to believe that all such assurances are merely ruses to allow \u201c the experts \u201d to do whatever they want .\nAllowing doctors to restart hearts in order to induce brain death calls into question the sincerity of transplant medical ethics .\nThankfully , some in organized medicine\u2014such as the American College of Physicians\u2014are resisting this new approach to organ gathering .\nBut the process seems to be expanding , with new hospitals instituting NRP-cDCD protocols on an ongoing basis .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general public to weigh in and say , \u201c This must stop !\n\u201d Some lines should never be crossed .\nAllowing doctors to kill patients during organ harvesting wouldn \u2019 t only be an acute threat to the sanctity of life , but I can think of no better way to sow mistrust in our health care system

Incentive to Provide Quality Service or Produce Results", "content": "One of the biggest differences between public and private K-12 schools is the incentives .\nPrivate schools are motivated to satisfy their customers , parents , and families \u2014 be responsive or risk losing them .\nFor the private school , losing a student equates to a direct loss of revenue .\nThe loss of several students could jeopardize their financial stability since their business model is based on tuition revenue rather than government funding .\nCase in point : Private schools were creative and resourceful during the COVID-19 school closures , finding solutions to fully reopen schools for five-day-a-week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2020-2021 school year .\nPublic schools , by significant contrast , had no such financial incentive to reopen schools .\nFunding was provided in full \u2014 plus hefty federal government COVID-19 relief money \u2014 regardless of whether they offered full student instruction or supervision .\nIn fact , they had an incentive to remain closed \u2014 using the reopening holdout as leverage to meet absurd teacher union demands .\nFor example , the teacher union of the Los Angeles Unified School District ( the second largest district in the country ) demanded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on charter schools , and Medicare for all to reopen .\nIn essence , they were holding children and teens hostage to demands that had nothing to do with providing learning for students or even their union members \u2019 jobs .\nBesides the lack of incentives to please their customers , public schools also lack strong incentives to produce academic results among their students .\nAgain , unlike private schools , funding continues regardless of results .\nFamilies who lack the financial resources to pay private school tuition or move to a higher-performing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nData shows that private schools outperform public schools despite significantly lower spending per student .\nFor example , the National Assessment of Educational Progress Exam scores reveal that private school students score significantly higher in each individual subject than public school peers at all testing grade levels ( i.e.\n, fourth , eighth , and twelfth ) .\nYet , the national average private school tuition is $ 12,218 per student for the 2022-2023 school year , while public school spending averages $ 16,862 per student .\nWashington State joins in with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 16,800 per student as of 2020-2021 .\nSeattle Public Schools \u2019 spending came in at $ 22,292 per student for 2021-2022\u2014 nearly double that of the national private school tuition average .\nImagine the implications of a free market K-12 landscape in which parents are empowered to select the school they believe will best serve their students .\nThe competition would push schools to provide quality , customer-focused learning .\nThe result for our nation \u2019 s educational system , and our future , could be truly transformational .\nThe good news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nArizona recently implemented universal school choice for all 1.1 million of the state \u2019 s K-12 students .\nAccording to a news release from the Office of Governor Doug Ducey in July , \u201c Arizona families who participate in ESAs would receive more than $ 6,500 per year per child for private school , homeschooling ,

people will quickly get back on their feet .\nNever mind that the crisis is largely caused by anti-social and dysfunctional personal behaviors .\nWhat matters is giving people a free place to live .\nIn 2013 , a law was passed by Congress requiring that all federally funded assistance programs apply the Housing First formula to ameliorating homelessness .\nCelebrated as a panacea , the Obama administration promised that the program could end veteran homelessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and family homelessness by 2020 .\nAdditionally , advocates argued that the approach would end all types of homelessness by 2023\u2014in other words , by next year .\nWe all know how that turned out .\nBased on sheer numbers alone , Housing First is clearly an abject failure resulting in lost lives , increased addiction , and spikes in crime .\nThe proof is in the pudding .\nSince 2013 , homelessness has grown exponentially .\nAs a new report ( pdf ) by my colleagues at the Discovery Institute demonstrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 20 % even as subsidized housing vouchers went up more than 40 % .\n\u201d Not coincidentally , California\u2014the epicenter of the crisis\u2014also went all-in for Housing First .\n\u201c In 2016 , \u201d the report notes , \u201c California enacted a law that required that every state dollar spent on homelessness be spent on Housing First programs .\nFrom 2015 ( the year before the new state policy ) to 2019 , unsheltered street-level homelessness in California rose 47.1 % .\n\u2026 California now boasts almost half of America \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in four

.\n\u201c In Seattle/King County \u2026 gun crimes tied to homelessness encampments jumped 122 % during the first half of 2022 .\nIn Portland , Oregon , people experiencing homelessness comprised 50 %

up to 640 deaths , with the most frequent cause of death being drug overdose.\n\u201d Anyone with a modicum of common sense could explain why .\nHousing First is all carrot cake with sweet frosting\u2014and no stick .\nSpecifically , the federal government forbids taxpayer funding for any homeless housing assistance project that requires anything in return from participants .\nFor example , taxpayer-funded housing programs can not require recipients to stop taking drugs\u2014which is often the reason they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can a program require that the mentally ill take their medications .\nThose receiving free housing can not be compelled to search for work or receive job training , or even , obey the law .\nIn other words , it is all \u201c quid , \u201d with no \u201c pro quo.\n\u201d Housing First is not only misguided compassion but also incredibly expensive .\nThe Los Angeles Times recently revealed that each unit of homeless housing in the city funded by a passed bond issue that takes the Housing First approach costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not talking about 3,000 square foot houses but small single apartment units .\nTo say the least , this is not \u201c affordable housing \u201d for the taxpayers .\nThere \u2019 s a better , more practical approach forward if the homelessness ideologues and government bureaucrats will just get out of the way .\nThe Discovery Institute study offers the following reforms that Republicans should pursue if they gain control of the Congress in the coming election : \u2022 Pass legislation directing HUD to eliminate Housing First as the primary approach to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PLUS Act to prohibit HUD from restricting funds going to providers that require the provision of supportive services ( such as addiction treatment or job counseling ) or program participation requirements , or to faith-based organizations .\n\u2022 Prioritize economic \u201c self-sufficiency \u201d as the primary measurement of effectiveness of all federal homelessness assistance programs rather than the number of housing vouchers distributed .\n\u2022 Prioritize trauma-informed wraparound services in all federal homelessness assistance programs by requiring substantial funding for services such as mental illness clinical services and treatment , substance use disorder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and job retention .\n\u2022 Require participation in treatment and training activities when enrolled in federally funded homelessness assistance programs ( similar to that required of PELL Grant recipients ) .\n\u2022 Eliminate the legal impediments that prevent Medicaid from reimbursing inpatient mental illness and substance abuse disorder treatments .\n\u2022 Incentivize local governments to reduce or eliminate building fees and burdensome regulations to enable affordable housing construction.\u200b Yes , solving the homelessness catastrophe will continue to cost money .\nBut eliminating Housing First will unleash

more successful in subverting America than the prior efforts by the Soviet Communists , who did succeed in the FDR and Truman administrations in controlling dozens of agents in the U.S. government .\nOne such agent , Alger Hiss , was FDR \u2019 s right-hand man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stalin sitting across the table to gain control of 10 Eastern European countries in the post-World War II world .\nWhile the CCP uses front groups for propaganda , they have mastered all manner of techniques with an emphasis on infiltration to influence , compromise and co-opt elites so as to \u201c capture \u201d them .\nTypical targets include university professors and scientists , media executives and reporters , and political , and corporate leaders .\nElite capture , first developed in China , was a form of corruption whereby rural elites used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources and monopolize the planning and management of development projects for personal gain at the expense of the larger population .\nNow the CCP uses it as the primary means in expanding the Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI ) all over the developing world , and to subvert developed countries , with a primary focus on the United States .\nWith China running a multi-billion-dollar trade surplus with the United States for many years , it has a huge stockpile of U.S. dollars to facilitate elite capture through generous funding of bribery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favors within China .\nAnd when elites take the bait , over time many find it difficult to admit fault and extricate themselves , and they may even choose to see their interests and those of China interconnected or even identical .\nIt took more than a decade from the opening of China orchestrated by Nixon and Kissinger in February of 1972 for trade between the United States and China to commence .\nAnd the CCP was initially more open to American companies manufacturing in China than selling their products in China .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ position as the preeminent low-cost manufacturing platform for American companies was well established .\nFast forward to today and we find that industry leading American companies such as Apple , Hewlett-Packard , Cisco , 3M , Wal-Mart , Hasbro ,

violations , such as the persecutions and forced labor of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang and the Tibetans in Xizang .\nToday \u2019 s CCP takes heed from Mao \u2019 s 10-year Cultural Revolution in China that began in 1966 .\nThey see cultural influence as paramount because it is upstream of politics and is the single most important force in shaping politics .\nThus , they have executed on partial

"title": "Are Electric Vehicles The Solution to Curbing Automobile Emissions?", "content": "Battery Electric Vehicles ( BEVs ) have been proposed as at least a partial solution to climate change .\nHowever , those who advocate for BEVs often discuss the pros of these types of vehicles while rarely making mention of their cons .\nIn this article , I examine both the pros and cons of BEVs and also suggest what I think is a far better solution : Plug-in Hybrid ( PHEVs ) and Hybrid Electric Vehicles ( HEVs ) , which dramatically reduce CO emissions without suffering as many downsides as BEVs .\nTo begin , producing batteries for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormously dirty business , with high environmental degradation .\nA single BEV battery weighs about 1,000 pounds , and requires mining about 90,000 pounds of ore , such as lithium , cobalt , nickel , graphite , and copper .\nIn order to glean this ore , anywhere from 200,000 to 1,500,000 pounds of Earth must be dug up or moved \u2014 roughly 500,000 pounds per battery .\nAccording to Mark Mills , co-director of the Institute on Manufacturing Science and Innovation at Northwestern University , when averaged over the life of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five pounds of Earth , whereas a comparable gasoline engine only consumes 0.2 pounds of liquid per mile .\nSo it must be noted that material extraction for BEV batteries is responsible for significantly more environmental disturbance relative to petroleum extraction .\nLithium , for example , is a major component of BEV batteries , and is produced in a complex process of mining under salt flats .\nThe evaporation process , which can take up to 18 months , can use up to 500,000 pounds of water for a single ton of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s supply of lithium is mined in parts of Argentina , Bolivia , and Chile , called the \u201c Lithium Triangle , \u201d in one of the driest parts of the world.1 Mining consumes sixty-five percent of the water in this area , which has serious negative impact on local farmers .\nBolivia , one of the poorest countries in South America , has been hit especially hard.2 My sense is that as we rush towards becoming carbon neutral in an attempt to ward off the future effects of climate change , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we \u2019 re simply shifting the environmental problem elsewhere rather than actually solving it .\nTo be fair , there is the \u201c well-to-wheel \u201d emissions argument that must be considered , which posits that when you factor in total emissions over the manufacturing and use of a BEV , the BEV wins out since it doesn \u2019 t produce CO emissions over its lifetime.3 What is known generally is when we take well-to-wheel emissions into account , BEVs will emit one-half as much CO annually compared to a conventional gasoline engine .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but is it the whole story ?\nLast year , the Wall Street Journal provided an instructive interactive infographic comparing vehicle emissions between BEVs and HEVs over a period from 2019 to 2050 , where the goal of the U.S. , in concert with the Paris Agreement to prevent global temperatures from rising more than two degrees Celsius , would be to limit its CO emissions to 39 gigatons .\nThe result : If the U.S. went fully BEV by 2035 , roughly 35.4 gigatons would be emitted , compared to roughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. went fully hybrid .\nWhile the result of full BEV scenario would theoretically bring global temperatures below the threshold ( presuming the U.S. and other countries who are part of the accord all do their part ) , it would put tremendous strain on the electrical grid and mineral extraction production .\nThe question is if there is some middle ground to achieve the 39 gigaton target .\nAs with any new , complex technology that seeks to disrupt the status quo , it \u2019 s not just enough to be groundbreaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sufficient scale to make an effective difference .\nBased on the current technology , BEVs are unlikely to come close to accomplishing this goal .\nAt best , BEVs are a niche market well-served by companies such as Tesla , who have built out an effective private infrastructure to support a relatively limited fleet of BEVs .\nScaling this to the 300 million cars driven in America , let alone to the over one billion cars in other countries , is unrealistic .\nThe current infrastructure to charge BEVs is woefully behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road today .\nIf BEV owners can \u2019 t charge at home , they are at the mercy of an available charger .\nAnd then , presuming they can find an available charger , chargers are often either not in operation or don \u2019 t deliver a charge anywhere near the rated kilowatt hours .\nSo a thirty-minute charge becomes an hour or longer .\nI experience this often , and it always seems to be when I didn \u2019 t plan on a long drive a night or two before .\nAlso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( on the order of 200-300 miles on a full charge ) \u2014 but for the health of the battery , the range is reduced 40 % to keep the car within 20 % to 80 % state of charge .\nBEV manufactures warn that batteries should not be driven down to 0 % or charged up to 100 % on a regular basis because it \u2019 s highly degrading to the battery .\nLong drives are a serious problem for BEV owners \u2014 with the exception of Tesla , which provides an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to optimize stops .\nNo other network comes close to that of Tesla , so other BEV owners find themselves greatly inconvenienced .\nThere is always the distinct possibility of not being able to find a charger before the car runs out of charge , which is not only inconvenient , but can be highly detrimental to BEV batteries .\nThe problem with BEVs is not , as some argue , that it \u2019 s only a new technology whose kinks need to be worked out .\nRather , the problem is with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBEV ranges will certainly increase in the future , but that still won \u2019 t solve long charge times and the massive infrastructure changes required to support BEVs at scale .\nThe business model of virtually all gas stations requires a continual parade of customers who make short stops for low-profit-margin gasoline and purchase higher profit items while they wait .\nThis business model won \u2019 t work if only servicing BEVs due to long charging times resulting in lower volume .\nEven if there were a shift to larger shopping centers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is difficult to see how this business model would practically scale .\nSo what is the solution ?\nI believe the practical middle ground rests with Plug-in Hybrids ( PHEVs ) and Hybrid Electric Vehicles ( HEVs ) , whose CO emissions rival that of BEVs .\nWhile BEVs are here to stay , HEVs and PHEVs provide a scalable solution for the future that doesn \u2019 t incur the \u201c range anxiety \u201d many drivers experience with BEVs .\nWith an HEV , there is no concern with charging .\nAdditionally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower emissions ( since the electric motor can power the car when idling or at low speeds ) , the same range as gasoline vehicles , and a far lower price than BEVs .\nAs hybrid technology continues to improve , we should see even greater gains than the theoretical scenario discussed above regarding total CO emissions over the next 30 years .\nAs with an HEV , a PHEV car uses an electric motor and an internal combustion engine either in tandem or independently .\nPHEVs can travel moderate distances ( 15-60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric motor alone and can also charge the battery through regenerative braking ( same as an HEV ) or by the internal combustion engine itself .\nSince they can fully run on the internal combustion engine , the car owner avoids situations where if they forgot or were unable to charge their vehicle , they will be inconvenienced .\nThis is not optimal for a PHEV , so owners should do their best to keep the battery charged , particularly since electricity is a cheaper fuel .\nWith optimal use , PHEVs can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average produce half the emissions of conventional gasoline vehicles .\nAll of the cars mentioned here use the same lithium-ion batteries \u2013 and therefore contribute in some manner to environmental degradation .\nHowever , HEV and PHEV batteries are far smaller than BEV batteries , which vary from 17 kWh to 118 kWh , with an average of 66 kWh .\nPHEV batteries range anywhere from 8-34 kWh , with an average battery size of 13 kWh .\nHEV batteries are the smallest of all .\nThey don \u2019 t have a particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to get the car rolling and then turn it over to the gasoline engine ( at best , an HEV battery could only power the electric motor for a drive of 2-3 miles ) .\nThe point here is that for every BEV battery , five or more batteries could be produced for PHEVs and HEVs .\nIn closing , had I known more about PHEVs prior to my purchase of a BEV , I most likely would have gone that route \u2013 an option I will certainly pursue in the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readily available as BEVs .\nThus , my argument is this : Unless BEV technology and infrastructure achieves a breakthrough that makes them a more feasible option for most use cases ( not just those who can charge at home overnight and who have short commutes ) , our priority should shift to PHEVs and HEVs , which are much less disruptive .\nAt some point , even those with short commutes will want to get out on the road for longer trips \u2013 and with current infrastructure , with the possible exception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an unpleasant experience .", "author": "Walter

of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elites so as to \u201c capture \u201d them .\nTypical targets include university professors and scientists , media executives and reporters , and corporate and political leaders .\nWithin a decade of opening relations with China in 1972 , the Chinese began wooing American businesses to set up shop in China , offering a cheap labor manufacturing platform and the promise of access to a large market .\nFast forward to today and we find that industry leading American companies such as Apple , Hewlett-Packard , Cisco , 3M , Wal-Mart , Hasbro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many others now manufacture far more of their products in China than anywhere else .\nWe learned through the COVID-19 experience that 80 percent of the basic components known as active pharmaceutical ingredients ( APIs ) , come from China .\nAll companies doing business in China have learned to remain silent and not criticize the CCP , especially regarding corruption in government and human rights violations , such as the persecutions and forced labor of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang and the Tibetans in Xizang .\nWith China running a multi-billion-dollar trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , it has plenty of U.S. dollars to facilitate elite capture through bribery .\nThe Chinese have spent billions to buy influence in America , and when the Chinese are successful with bribery , they intend to influence and gain control of their American targets .\nAnd of course , once having taken money illicitly , people find themselves compromised and in an awkward position to extricate themselves .\nOften these compromised elites have little choice but to see their interests and those of China interconnected or even identical .\nToday \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s ten-year Cultural Revolution in China that began in 1966 .\nThey see cultural influence as paramount because it is upstream of politics and is the single most important force in shaping society downstream .\nThus , they have executed on partial elite

the Legendary Jurassic World Production Company , Dick Clarke Productions , STX Entertainment , IM Global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more .\nWith China being one of the largest markets for big-screen movies , all American production houses now self-censor \u2014 avoiding any criticism of the Chinese government or mention of Taiwan , Tibet , or the Uyghurs .\nWith media conglomerates being multidimensional , it \u2019 s impossible for their news entities to remain insulated from Chinese influence .\nFor example , companies such as Disney , which owns ABC , and Comcast , which owns NBC News , CNBC , and MSNBC , for example \u2014 are large multinational conglomerates that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including entertainment companies .\nConflicts of interest resulting from Chinese relationships between not only Hollywood and the news media but also theme parks , cellular and cable networks , and movie theaters \u2014 with nearly all the products they sell manufactured in China \u2014 are inevitable .\nThe same Disney that owns ABC has a theme park in Shanghai , and it also owns ESPN .\nIn turn , ESPN has a multibillion-dollar content-rights deal with the NBA .\nLebron James the biggest American basketball star in China and the center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CCP crackdowns in Hong Kong .\nWithout a doubt the greatest elite capture by the CCP has been the Joe Biden family , which started at least as far back as 2013 when son Hunter accompanied his father Joe , then U.S. vice president , on a trip to China .\nSignificant payments to the Biden family started a few years later .\nAfter studying the

Warming Up", "content": "Earlier this year , Arizona Governor Doug Ducey made history by signing universal school choice into law .\nThe importance of this development can hardly be overstated .\nNationwide , a vast and growing legion of parents , as well as the general public , are coming to realize with the right political leadership in place , educational freedom can be afforded to all families in an entire state , regardless of their financial status .\nThe midterm elections offered an opportunity to take another major step .\nAnd though the election did not bring about the anticipated red wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for educational freedom .\nAs Corey DeAngelis summarizes , Florida Governor Ron DeSantis , Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds , New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu , Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt , Tennessee Governor Bill Lee , and Texas Governor Greg Abbott each \u201c blew out their opponents after making school choice a centerpiece of their campaigns.\n\u201d State superintendents who emphasized empowering parents were also elected \u2014 Ryan Walters of Oklahoma and Ellen Weaver of South Carolina are two noteworthy examples , both winning by double-digit percentage points .\nAnd there were victories for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positions , whose influence can also be profound .\nCredit for these victories is due to a groundswell of parents who , over the past few years , spoke out and became actively engaged .\nParents witnessing nothing short of educational malpractice , as public schools remained closed by COVID-19 long after it was safe to reopen and political indoctrination increasingly took precedence over foundational academic learning , led to the uprising .\nThe growing movement of parents seeking educational freedom has several facets .\nFirst , parents want educational freedom from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe obsession with \u2018 equity \u2019 is eroding education , and parents know it .\nThey see the results firsthand \u2014 learning standards are lowered , personal responsibility is being removed , student discipline is plummeting , curriculum and assessment priorities are misplaced , and race is the driving factor in teacher hiring rather than teaching qualifications .\nSecond , the majority of parents do not want radical gender ideology peddled to their children , nor to have them exposed to pornographic materials .\nParents object to their children being subject to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which can bring about irreversible lifelong consequences .\nIn school districts across the country , materials are becoming ubiquitous that many parents deem not only age-inappropriate but frankly outrageous .\nKnowing that many parents strongly object to the sexualization of their children and teens , school personnel often employ intentionally dishonest and secretive plans to keep parents in the dark about what is pushed on their minor-age children during the school day .\nFinally , parents want freedom from the government-run K-12 education monopoly that is failing their children .\nThey \u2019 ve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public education , which was exacerbated by the prolonged school closures and the limited remote sessions .\nThe veil has been lifted \u2014 parents are now keenly aware that public schools have no incentive to provide quality service or produce results .\nThe educational victories in various states are a testament to the power of the \u2018 parents \u2019 party , \u2019 which , by many accounts , is still in its infancy .\nIn the coming years , this parent movement will continue to grow in number and influence as public schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agendas and as more parents experience the tremendous benefits of educational freedom .\nMuch work lies ahead .\nBut with the educational freedom political wins in the midterm elections , and the mass exodus from public schools witnessed over the past three school years , Republicans are now poised for significant nationwide reform .\nRandi Weingarten and the teachers \u2019 unions , who shut down schools and held children hostage to meet their political demands , may be in for a comeuppance .\nIt won \u2019 t be an easy or quick undertaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 unions over our children \u2019 s education .\nBut the opportunity for positive change has greater potential than in decades past .\nWith Arizona \u2019 s example , the coming expansion of educational freedom will help break down the K-12 monopoly .\nFree markets , missing from today \u2019 s educational landscape , will drive competition and innovation .\nThe result will be more effective and cost-efficient K-12 education , with newly-empowered parents \u2014 the customers \u2014 holding education providers accountable .\nOver time , as the positive benefits of educational freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just be parents and the right advocating for it .\nCommunity and business leaders will recognize the benefits of a higher-quality workforce and join the growing movement for educational freedom .\nIt \u2019 s time we break free from the educational freedom constraints plaguing our nation and jeopardizing our children \u2019 s futures .\nThough the midterm election wins for the right were far less than hoped and anticipated , there were valuable victories .\nHats off to parents for their contribution toward achieving advancements in educational freedom for America \u2019 s children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher .\nWe must not let up but rather continue to press on until the battle for educational freedom is won for every family nationwide .",

Gratitude, And Perseverance: Americans Have Much To Learn From The Pilgrim Story", "content": "The Thanksgiving holiday , which commemorates one part of the Pilgrim story , remains the favorite holiday for many Americans \u2014 and for good reasons beyond enjoying a feast .\nWith our country passing through troubled times , it is worth revisiting the Pilgrims \u2019 five significant achievements , which created the seminal story of America , and reveal remarkable insight into who we are and the qualities of character we need to overcome our present challenges .\nFirst , of the many groups of settlers who came to America , only the Pilgrims were singularly motivated by a spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had its origin with the Protestant Reformation a century before .\nThey repeatedly spoke about their voyage to the New World in terms of a flight from tyranny to freedom , comparing themselves to God \u2019 s chosen people \u2014 the Israelites \u2014 who overcame slavery and abuse in Egypt to get to the Promised Land .\nSimilar to the Israelites \u2019 exodus , the Pilgrims had left what they saw as oppressive and morally corrupt authorities in Great Britain and Europe to create a new life in America .\nThus , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pilgrims \u2019 Thanksgiving story .\nThanksgiving could be thought of as the holiday that made the other American holidays possible .\nWithout the Pilgrims having courage , absolute faith in their cause and calling , and a willingness to sacrifice and risk everything , they never would have embarked on the 94-foot Mayflower \u2014 a ship of questionable seaworthiness .\nWere it not for their faith and determination to find freedom of conscience and live according to their biblical beliefs , there may never have been a July Fourth Independence Day or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted and celebrate each year .\nAfter a harrowing passage across the Atlantic , one that included wild pitching and broadside batterings by gale force winds and ferocious seas that caused the splitting of the ship \u2019 s main beam , the Mayflower was blown off course from the intended destination of the established Virginia Colony territory to wilds of Cape Cod .\nThe Pilgrims knew not where they were nor how to proceed , so they beseeched the Almighty for favor in making landfall in a suitable place with fresh water and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent settlement .\nNow in sight of land after a frightening voyage and facing hunger from spoiled and depleted provisions and anxious about settling outside the purview of Virginia Company charter territory , the secular Mayflower passengers were restless and insolent .\nAnd this is when the Pilgrims made their second major achievement that would shape the future of America .\nPilgrim leaders John Carver , William Bradford , and William Brewster recognized that Mayflower passengers , diverse as they were , needed to maintain unity to survive in a potentially inhospitable environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would be acceptable to both their Christian brethren and the secular crewman and merchant adventurers \u2014 who made up about half of the 102 people aboard the Mayflower .\nThat governing document , known as the Mayflower Compact , provided for peace , security , and equality for everyone in their anticipated settlement .\nWith every man aboard signing the Mayflower Compact , the Pilgrims established the foundation for democratic self-government based on the will of the people for the first time .\nThe Mayflower Compact laid the cornerstone of the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted some 170 years later .\nThe fact that all the Pilgrims survived the squalid and cramped ship quarters during the dangerous crossing of a vast ocean is no doubt partially attributable to the good fortune that the Mayflower had previously been enlisted as a wine transport cargo ship .\nUnlike most merchant ships , she had a \u201c sweet smell , \u201d from all her decks and bilges being \u201c disinfected \u201d with wine sloshing and soaking from broken barrels of Bordeaux and high-alcohol port in the many prior crossings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed once the Mayflower \u2019 s passengers settled in \u201c New Plymouth , \u201d Massachusetts in December of 1620 .\nThe first winter was devastating , with illness afflicting most and over half the Pilgrims dying , including four entire families .\nBut it could have been worse .\nThe fate of the Pilgrim colonists would surely have been more difficult had they not settled where they did , adjacent to friendly natives of the Pokanoket Indian village that were part of the Wampanoag tribe .\nAnd had they not befriended two who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Samoset \u2014 perhaps none would have survived .\nSquanto and his fellow native tribesmen would teach the Pilgrims survival skills , showing them how to hunt , fish , and plant various crops , such as corn , squash , and varieties of beans , which were unknown to the Englishmen .\nThe Pilgrims \u2019 third major achievement was the Pilgrim-Wampanoag Peace Treaty , which was signed on April 1 , 1621 , by Massasoit and leaders of the Plymouth colony .\nAnd a remarkable accomplishment it was , for it lasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsequent peace treaties made by other colonizing groups with native Indian tribes .\nThe fact that there were bloody conflicts between other colonists and tribes , such as in the Pequot War fought in Connecticut in 1636-1637 , makes the Pilgrims stand out , for they succeeded in maintaining the longest-lasting and most equitable peace between natives and immigrants in the history of what would become the United States .\nIn spite of learning from the native Indians how to plant , cultivate , and harvest new crops in their first year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company charter that called for settlement farmland to be owned and worked communally and for harvests to be equally shared .\nThis socialist common property approach created disincentives to work .\nWilliam Bradford recorded in his memoirs that while \u201c slackers showed up late for work \u2026 everybody was happy to claim their equal share \u2026 and production only shrank.\n\u201d Although no one is certain of the exact date of the first Thanksgiving , we know it was a Pilgrim initiative , celebrated in November 1621 to give thanks to God for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during that first winter in Plymouth .\nThey were also giving thanks for their first harvest \u2014 meager though it was .\nWhen Massasoit was invited to join the Pilgrims , it was assumed that he wouldn \u2019 t bring more guests than the 50-odd Pilgrim survivor hosts .\nMassasoit arrived with twice that number , well-stocked with food , fowl , and game of all kinds \u2014 including five deer .\nThere was more than enough for everyone , and it turns out that the first Thanksgiving celebration would last three days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dance , Pilgrim prayers , and even a military parade by Myles Standish .\nThe Pilgrims \u2019 fourth major achievement was the rejection of socialism and the adoption of private enterprise .\nAfter the meager Thanksgiving harvest , the second season of collective farming and distribution proved equally disappointing .\nGov .\nBradford had seen enough , recording that the system \u201c was found to breed much confusion and discontent and retard much employment that would have been to their benefit and comfort.\n\u201d So before the 1623 season , he scrapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ownership of land for each of the families .\nAs a result of becoming responsible for their own welfare and gaining freedom to choose what to grow for consumption or trade , the Pilgrims \u2019 productivity surged .\nThe fifth factor that distinguished the Pilgrims was their model relational behavior .\nWhile tolerance enabled them to keep relative harmony within their diverse community , they also looked outwardly to serve and help others .\nIn March of 1623 , it came to be known that Massasoit was on the brink of death from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edward Winslow immediately set out on a 40-mile journey to administer medicinal broth , natural herbs , and

instantly convert from in-person to remote instruction .\nConsequently , the quality and quantity were poor .\nThis starkly contrasts non-traditional education providers who intentionally design remote learning content and delivery for virtual and hybrid learners .\nFurthermore , their teachers are selected and trained specifically for the virtual learning environment , which aids their comfort level and professional motivation with remote delivery .\nSecond , there is a substantial difference in terms of the motivations of the students and families .\nTraditional public-school families were suddenly thrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority experienced a prolonged nightmare .\nIn large part , the power-hungry teachers \u2019 unions colluding with left-wing political leaders caused the closures to drag on well beyond what was needed to ensure the well-being of students .\nThis is in sharp contrast to families who research and intentionally seek online learning \u2014 in part or whole \u2014 for a variety of reasons .\nFamilies who select virtual or hybrid learning are attracted , and in many cases retained , by the distinct advantages the non-traditional providers offer .\nFor example , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the pace of learning , as well as the flexibility to complete the learning anywhere are strong draws .\nAlso , students can return to lessons on-demand as needed rather than the one-shot chance provided in a face-to-face classroom .\nSocial reasons such as avoiding bullying , the flexibility to travel , and the unique ability for remediation or early graduation are also benefits .\nAdditionally , online learning can be a solution for students devoting significant time to pursuing hobbies , including arts and rigorous athletic training , or for students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make in-person learning at a set time and place not feasible .\nThe third difference is non-traditional education providers deliver a more thorough and thoughtful admissions process to determine if students are good candidates for their learning model .\nRather than assuming a seamless and effortless transition for students from traditional schooling to their model , they consider many factors , such as parental supervision and involvement , student reading skills ( starting in mid-elementary grades ) , and student organization and motivation .\nImportantly , these education providers consider ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secondary online and hybrid schooling differs in design from college-level online learning .\nAge-appropriate and developmental levels inform the content , learning experiences , instructional practices , and types of assessments employed at the various K-12 grades .\nThis is different from online higher education , which often relies heavily on independent reading , lengthy lectures , discussion board posts , and paper writing ( in many cases as the only form of assessment ) .\nIn short , the K-12 online and hybrid experience necessitates more teacher support and less-autonomous student learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents and students are onboarded .\nThe process is designed to equip parents and get students started on the right foot .\nIt provides everything from platform ( typically referred to as the learning management system ) navigation skills , time management tips , organizational techniques , self-advocacy skills development , academic integrity training , and guidance on how to interact respectfully and meaningfully with peers and teachers online .\nTime is also devoted to helping student gain comfort and confidence with the learning format , including lessons , discussions , and assessments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As with adult employee remote work , online and hybrid schooling is not for every K-12 student .\nBut when it is the preferred delivery choice by the educator and family , the environment is well-designed , the individual is determined to be a strong fit , and there is effective onboarding to prepare for the online experience , it can be a significant win for everyone involved .\nThe benefits can include enhanced time efficiency , engagement , and motivation .\nThe new online era is here to stay for both work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the move away from the traditional five-days-a-week norm will grow in demand as school choice legislation continues to expand around the country .\nMore families will be freed from the K-12 public monopoly , where teachers \u2019 unions \u2019 bosses can hold children as hostages \u2014 locked out from learning \u2014 to meet inappropriate demands .\nNow is the time to advance educational freedom for families .\nIt is also the time for educational entrepreneurs \u2014 edupreneurs \u2014 to come on the scene to design and develop not only additional online and hybrid @ @ @ @

"discoveryinstitute", "title": "The \u2018China Model\u2019 and the WEF", "content": "For decades Klaus Schwab \u2019 s World Economic Forum ( WEF ) has been recruiting and cultivating corporate and political leaders from all over the world to embrace a vision and plan for a complete social , political , and economic transformation \u2014 a \u201c Great Reset \u201d \u2014 which is nothing short of a communist \u201c New World Order.\n\u201d This plan calls for the end of sovereign states ; the end of private property and the remaking of the economy based on environmental , social , and governance rankings ; the replacement of oil and gas with so-called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transformation of agricultural production ; the replacement of traditional money with social credit score-linked digital currency ; and the requirement of universal health passports \u2014 to name some key WEF objectives .\nAfter the G20 meeting in Indonesia on November 15-16 , 2022 , WEF chairman Klaus Schwab broadcast on CGTN TV that \u201c the Chinese model is certainly a very attractive model\u2026 \u201d For Schwab , China is the model because the totality of its social controls is what is needed to facilitate the Great Reset .\nSo , let \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese model and then examine the correlation to the WEF program .\nChina is a one-party state ruled by the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) , which now has the distinction , along with North Korea , of having the most complete totalitarian control over its people of any state in all human history .\nThe CCP has now accomplished : \u2022 the near total control of peoples \u2019 thinking and knowledge of history through state control of schools , the internet , and all media \u2022 the control of people \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the state with accounts for every Chinese citizen \u2014 accounts that the government can turn off when account holder \u2019 s social credit score drops or when the account holder travels outside a zone prescribed by government \u2022 the control of people by requiring universal health passports \u2022 the control of people by way of wall-to-wall facial-recognition camera surveillance The China model has also embraced a \u201c zero-COVID \u201d policy , wherein citizens have been put under virtual house arrest for months , making it impossible to even go out to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieving zero COVID cases .\nThe world just got a glimpse of the powder keg that is China when the simmering grievances against this draconian zero-COVID policy erupted in unprecedented street protests all over the country on November 25 , 2022 , after ten people burned alive in a high-rise apartment in the city of Urumqui .\nThese deaths were the direct result of government \u2019 s policy of enforced quarantines that that included welding apartment doors shut to prevent escape .\nDiverse countries from Canada , Holland , and Germany to Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have all experienced severe injury from policies implemented by political leaders groomed by Schwab and his Young Global Leaders program .\nIn Canada , it is well known that Prime Minster Justin Trudeau is one of Schwab \u2019 s most favored young leaders .\nIn 2017 Schwab had a reception for Justin Trudeau , in which he said , \u201c we penetrate the cabinets\u2026 and I know that half his cabinet are actually [ WEF ] Young Global Leaders.\n\u201d Canadian policies appear to have come right out of the WEF playbook .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of zero emissions , Trudeau has imposed a carbon tax , and ordered farmers to reduce fertilizers by 30 % use by 2030 .\nTrudeau also signed the Known Traveler Digital ID program \u2014 a WEF initiative \u2014 without the Canadian people \u2019 s consent .\nTrudeau \u2019 s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance , Chrystia Freeland , is all in , co-chairing a WEF Zoom meeting in December 2020 to convey that goals after the pandemic should revolve around restructuring society , canceling oil and gas development , and censoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in lockstep with the WEF during the Canadian trucker \u2019 s protest , when she shut down the corporate and personal bank accounts of truckers and donors to the trucker protest .\nIn Germany , Angela Merkel was recognized as a leader by Schwab in the late 1990s and remained prominent within the WEF during her 16-year stint as chancellor of Germany .\nIn 2011 she upended Germany \u2019 s energy makeup , shuttering coal power plants ( supplying 50 % of Germany \u2019 s power ) , phasing out nuclear power plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accelerating wind and solar renewable energy .\nAs a result , today Germany faces the self-inflicted disaster of unprecedented energy shortages and dramatic price increases , causing Germany \u2019 s two largest steel manufacturers to close operations , along with the closure of paper and glass manufacturers .\nNow Germany \u2019 s showcase automotive industry is at risk .\nIn the Netherlands , Prime Minster Mark Rutte was recognized as a promising global leader by Schwab by about 2017 \u2014 when Rutte was entering his third term .\nIn 2020 he was chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s Food Action Alliance called the European Food Innovation Hub .\nThe following year WEF \u2019 s European Food Hub project was funded by the Dutch government and established in Wageningen , the Netherlands .\nIn June 2022 , Rutte \u2019 s ruling coalition announced the requirement for Holland to cut emissions of pollutants \u2014 predominantly fertilizers made up of nitrogen oxide and ammonia \u2014 by 50 % by 2030 .\nWhen it was learned that would require dramatic livestock reduction and the closing of thousands of farms , Dutch farmers took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only in their tractors , shutting down commerce and traffic on highways for months .\nUnfazed by these disruptive protests , the Rutte government has pushed ahead , and announced it will buy out , and seize , if necessary , some 3000 farms .\nWhy should this happen in Holland , the number two exporter ( after the U.S. ) of agricultural products in the world ?\nOne Dutch legislator who filed a FOI request for correspondence between Dutch Government officials and Schwab between 2016 and 2021 thinks that evidence shows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and became aligned with WEF \u2019 s initiative to \u201c transform the way food is produced , supplied and consumed.\n\u201d On the other side of the world , Schwab and the WEF have made major inroads with the ruling class in both Australia and New Zealand .\nThe record and content of email between Australian prime minister Scott Morrison and Schwab from 2018-2022 obtained by a Freedom of Information filing with the Australian government suggests that Morrison is acting as a proxy to WEF \u2019 s \u201c Great Reset.\n\u201d Morrison admits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the WEF and Australia \u2019 s trade and investment policy priorities\u2026 \u201d Jacinda Ardern , the present prime minister of New Zealand was first elected MP in 2008 when she was twenty-eight , the same year she was elected to be the president of the International Union of Socialist Youth , a role which also took her on a China visit .\nShe was first chosen for the WEF Young Global Leaders program in 2014 .\nIn her first term as prime minister , Ardern was faced with making leadership decisions as COVID-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2020 .\nHer draconian lockdown policies were among the most severe among nations \u2014 so much so that some charged her with purposely trying to see just how much control a \u201c democracy \u201d could hold over the people .\nIn November 2020 correspondence to Arden , Schwab wrote , \u201c The Forum will work closely with your office to ensure\u2026 the ensuing Great Reset process are of maximum value to your country and its role in shaping the post-Covid-19 world.\n\u201d Sri Lanka , a lush country of rice paddies and banana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July when its president , Gotabaya Rajapaska , fled the country after riots erupted over inflation , shortages of food , power blackouts , and government bankruptcy .\nIt turns out that Rajapaska was the fall guy , for he left Sri Lanka in the hands of the prime minister , Ranil Wickremesinghe , the devoted \u201c Member and Agenda Coordinator for WEF , \u201d who was the chief architect of the green energy transition that had brought on the collapse after banning nitrogen-based fertilizers and curtailing fossil fuel use in Sri Lanka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the government under Wickremesinghe didn \u2019 t miss a beat amid the crisis , implementing a nationwide QR code digital ID to facilitate a national fuel rationing scheme .\nAll of this would be considered unbelievable fiction for a country whose long history never included a food crisis or shortage , if so many Sri Lankan people \u2019 s lives weren \u2019 t in fact devastated and destroyed by misguided policies from WEF elites .\nIt \u2019 s really past the time that people recognize that the elite capture , influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of the clubby cult of Klaus Schwab and the WEF are two fronts of the same irregular war .\nIf they are not rejected and stopped freedom will be lost .", "author": "Scott S.

piece , which was published in Newsweek back in 1993 , I warned that legalizing assisted suicide would lead to organ harvesting of those killed by doctors \u201c as a plum to society.\n\u201d For my trouble .\nI was called alarmist and hysterical\u2014and those were the nice letters .\nAlas , rather than being alarmist , I was prescient .\nToday in Belgium , the Netherlands , and Canada , people who ask to be killed by doctors are sometimes organ harvested too .\nNot only that , but the phenomenon was celebrated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to organ donation \u201d in the Ottawa Citizen , with the story sighing , \u201c Ontarians who opt for medically assisted deaths ( MAiD ) are increasingly saving or improving other people \u2019 s lives by also including organ and tissue donation as part of their final wishes.\n\u201d Understand that in Canada , one need not be terminally ill to qualify for a lethal injection .\nThe patient can be disabled , elderly and lonely , or chronically ill\u2014and starting next year , people with mental illnesses will also be eligible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once someone is accepted for euthanasia in Ontario , he or she doesn \u2019 t receive suicide prevention .\nNo .\nNo .\nInstead , the Trillium Gift of Life Network in the province contacts the soon-to-be-killed person to ask for their heart , liver , and kidneys .\nAs the story reports , \u201c Ontario , through Trillium , immediately moved to the forefront of organ and tissue donation through MAiD , becoming the first jurisdiction in the world to proactively reach out to those who had been approved for assisted death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these patients wouldn \u2019 t be dying if they weren \u2019 t going to be lethally injected .\nThat serves the organ harvesting agenda well , according to the Citizen , \u201c MAiD donations also typically provide more time for testing donor organs and better matching with recipients.\n\u201d Again , that time lag would also permit intensive suicide prevention efforts , but that isn \u2019 t a public policy priority in Canada when one asks for euthanasia .\nBut here \u2019 s the thing that rarely gets mentioned : Conjoining organ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point for deciding to choose to be killed by a suffering patient , particularly one who is mentally ill .\nRemember , these are despairing people who could easily come to think that their deaths have greater value than their lives .\nIt \u2019 s a monstrous abandonment .\n\u200bI wish I could say that organ donation conjoined with lethal injections was the only slide down the slippery slope I have predicted correctly in my decades of anti-euthanasia advocacy .\nHere \u2019 s a short list of some of the other wrongs I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to pass .\n\u2022 Pediatric Euthanasia : If killing is a \u201c compassionate medical treatment , \u201d as the right to die movement says , how can it be denied to children ?\nEventually , it won \u2019 t be , I have predicted .\nAnd sure enough : Belgium allows children of all ages to be euthanized and has publicly reported that children as young as 9 have been made dead by their doctors .\nDitto , the Netherlands .\nThe Dutch also allow doctors to commit active infanticide of babies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThere is even a bureaucratic checklist for doctors to decide which babies can be killed known as the \u201c Groningen Protocol.\n\u201d \u2022 Killing People with Dementia : Another of my predictions warned that legalizing euthanasia would eventually spread to allowing people who aren \u2019 t competent to be killed .\nAnd so it came to pass .\nBelgium , the Netherlands , and soon Canada , permit people diagnosed with dementia to order themselves lethally injected after they become incompetent .\nOnce the document is signed and the patient loses capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds because their \u201c former \u201d selves now control what happens to them .\nThis license to kill the now incapacitated has even led to one woman in the Netherlands being held down by her family as she struggled against being lethally injected .\nThat was against the law , but the doctor was exonerated of committing a crime because the judge said she acted \u201c in good faith.\n\u201d Soon afterward , the Dutch Parliament changed the law to permit such non-voluntary killings to take place legally .\n\u2022 Euthanizing the Elderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ euthanasia activists promote the idea of allowing the elderly to die rather than face the infirmities of old age .\nSure enough .\nBelgium and the Netherlands have both seen cases of joint euthanasia deaths by married couples who would rather both die than face the pain of widowhood .\nThere was even one case in Belgium of a couple \u201c who feared the future \u201d being euthanized by a doctor\u2014with the planned death arranged by their son .\nAnd in Canada , an elderly woman in a nursing home chose to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family by COVID-19 protocols .\nIronically , the very authorities who wouldn \u2019 t allow her family to visit her if she chose to live , permitted them to be present when she received the lethal injection .\nCan you imagine ?\n\u2022 Death Doctor Shopping : I have warned frequently against \u201c doctor shopping , \u201d that is patients refused assisted suicide by their own doctors merely going to another doctor they know is willing to do the deed .\nExamples of such cases are rife .\nFor example , in Belgium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered lifelong depression , even though he was clearly not a medical expert in mental illness nor her treating doctor .\nDoctor shopping happens all of the time in this country too .\nIt will soon get much worse with assisted suicide now permitted in states such as Oregon and Washington by telemedicine .\nMoreover , Oregon no longer requires that a patient requesting death be a resident , which means patients from all over the country may be able to access poison prescriptions from doctors they hardly know and may have only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Demand : I have often remarked that the logic of euthanasia inevitably leads to death on demand for any reason that a suicidal person wants .\nThus , I was appalled\u2014but not shocked\u2014when Germany \u2019 s highest court created both a fundamental right to suicide and the right to assist or be assisted in being made dead .\nAnd this right exists for any reason .\nThe court ruled , \u201c The right to a self-determined death is not limited to situations defined by external causes like serious or incurable illnesses , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life or illness .\nRather , this right is guaranteed in all stages of a person \u2019 s existence.\n\u201d In all of this , I \u2019 m reminded of Canadian journalist Andrew Coyne \u2019 s lament , written more than 20 years ago , about the popular support for euthanasia he sensed in his country : \u201c A society that believes in nothing can offer no argument even against death .\nA culture that has lost its faith in life can not comprehend why it should be endured.\n\u201d If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trajectory we will end up in the same dark corner as Canada , the Netherlands , and Belgium .\nAnd the real danger to our cultural wellbeing is that the people who now complacently assume that such warnings are alarmist will be the ones applauding the loudest when that dark time comes .", "author":

States", "content": "Across cultures , people have sought to flee oppression and escape persecution from the beginning of recorded history .\nA recurring theme in Western classical literature and in modern classics such as Superman and Disney originals , which revolve around the struggle between good and evil , is the need and critical role for a rescuer or savior .\nThe ultimate rescuer and savior for mankind would be a \u201c messiah , \u201d who would vanquish evil , oppression and falsehood once and for all .\nIt is no accident that only Christianity has its roots and its entire reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNo other religion makes the claim that it was founded by a messiah .\nWithout a doubt , Christmas is a magical time of year not just because of the appeal of peace and a guiding star , as well as decorations , light displays , and volumes of wonderful music , but specifically because it marks the birth of Jesus Christ , who came into this world as the son of God , the Messiah and savior for all who accept him .\nChristmas is really about internal and eternal things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many people think approaching God is impossible .\nFor them , Christianity appears to be a religion with questionable appeal because of the perception that it is like all the other religions that require giving up certain bad habits and behaviors and performing good works in order to approach God .\nSurprise , surprise : Christ reminds us in Matthew 11:30 that , \u201c My yoke is easy , and My burden is light.\n\u201d When a learned Jewish Pharisee whose life revolved around living up to stressful demands of the Mosaic law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the law , Jesus answered simply that if we love God and love our neighbor as ourselves , we will have fulfilled all the laws .\nEven non-believers know there was something different about Jesus .\nFor one thing , Jesus Christ , being God , affected history with such an impact that He split time , dividing all human activities and events into happening before his coming ( called B.C . )\nor after his coming ( called A.D. ) .\nChrist had to have had a supernatural impact for non-Christians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history in two .\nWhy People Can Trust that Christ Was Truly Born First , Jesus Christ is more historically verifiable than any other person who lived in that ancient time and era\u2014including such luminaries as the Roman emperors , Aristotle or Alexander the Great\u2014because of the number of eyewitness accounts that were recorded in writing within a generation of his life .\nChrist is the only person in history who was pre-announced starting 1,000 years before he was born , with 18 different prophets from the Old Testament between tenth and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth , life , and death .\nHundreds of years later , the circumstances of Christ \u2019 s birth , life and death validated those prophecies in surprisingly accurate detail .\nThis is unique to Jesus Christ\u2014no one else in human history .\nSecond , Christ lived , and not only demonstrated his otherworldly power to heal and perform the ultimate miracle of bringing the dead back to life , but he set the absolute highest standard of love possible\u2014being willing to die to give life to others .\nAs Jesus prophesied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plan .\nIt provided \u201c seeing is believing \u201d evidence by bringing Jesus back from the dead and buried in a tomb to being alive , thus providing living proof of who He is .\nIn fact , Jesus made ten separate appearances to his disciples between the resurrection and his ascension into Heaven , a period of 40 days .\nSome of those appearances were to individual disciples , some were to several disciples at the same time , and once even to 500 at one time .\nThis was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of multiple separate eyewitness accounts that were recorded in writing .\nThird , no other religion teaches that God became flesh .\nIn other religions God is too high , otherworldly , and pure to be accessible in terms of having a communion with believers .\nIn Christianity , God had his Son born in the humbleness of a stable and had him raised in Nazareth , a small and very poor town that was one of the lowest in social status in Israel .\nUnlike other religious paths that require certain formalities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God not by his or her works but by simply a humble recognition that Christ gave his life for our sins\u2014that he paid the price for us\u2014and that through Christ we can have a direct relationship with God .\nThere Would Be No Constitution without Christianity As a Christian holiday , Christmas is foundational to America \u2019 s original character .\nIf Christ had never been born and died the way He did , all of history would have been different .\nFor one thing , neither Columbus nor the Pilgrims would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good news of salvation through Christ to explore or establish a new community with a higher purpose in the New World .\nThere would never have been a constitutional government created in the way and time that it was in America , without two necessary conditions : First , the foundation of recognizing man \u2019 s unalienable rights of freedom and equality that came out of the teachings of Christ , more fully recognized in the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century .\nSecond , the unprecedented collection of Christian human genius that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we call the Founding Fathers , who were deeply influenced by Christianity .\nThe founders knew the potential depravity that exists in everyone can lead to abuse of power and tyranny .\nFor this reason , they structured the government with checks and balances between the three branches of government , but also through the federalist system of division of power between the states and the federal government .\nThe constitutional republic formed by the Founders provided for and protected individual rights of freedom and independence such that America achieved material prosperity more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Additionally , the American constitutional framework enabled people to move closer to the divine image in which all people are created free and equal more than they would have achieved under any prior system .\nHistory shows that so many levels of human advancement were made possible by God who became man , born in the humble circumstances of a dirty stable in the small village of Bethlehem , a speck in the vast Roman Empire .\nWhile that empire would crumble and fall , Jesus , who had neither an army nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become the Lord and Savior for people who believe all over the world .\nFor , as He said , \u201c My Kingdom is not of this world .\n\u201d", "author": "Scott S.
