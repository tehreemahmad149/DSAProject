.\nSuccessful people do not waste their time listening to complainers ; more specifically , they do not make time for people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they are offered .\nComplainers who fail to focus on finding solutions to their problems are toxic because they pressure people into listening to them , ignore their help , and often leave them feeling drained .\nWhen successful people come across a complainer , they listen , offer a solution , and if their solution is ignored or dismissed , they distance themselves .\n2 .\nThey do not get sucked into toxic , irrational behavior .\nToxic people tend to manipulate , gaslight , and lie .\nSuccessful people refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper hand .\nThey do not let toxic people push their buttons and they distance themselves as soon as they feel negative energy .\nMost people find this to be the most difficult thing to do ; the reason for this is that , more often than not , the toxic people in our lives are family members , friends , or romantic partners .\nIt can be challenging to set boundaries when the person is someone who is extremely close to you .\nHowever , no matter how difficult it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes necessary .\nTaking this further , boundaries allow you to feel respected and in control .\nSubsequently , they greatly contribute to your happiness and your overall wellbeing .\n4 .\nThey focus on solutions \u2013 not problems .\nWhile most of us may look at our relationship with a toxic person and only think about the issues which arise from it , successful people focus on finding solutions .\nWhen presented with a problem , they stop to analyze their options before deciding what to do .\nThis means finding out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time they spend with them , or cut them off completely .\n5 .\nThey forgive them without forgetting .\nSuccessful people do not hold grudges .\nMoreover , they do not waste their time and energy plotting revenge or feeling sorry for themselves .\nInstead , they forgive the ones who have wronged them without forgetting what they have done .\nIn other words , although they may give toxic people a second chance , they also ensure that they protect themselves from future harm .\n6 .\nThey do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abusers , and gaslighters can make you doubt yourself .\nWhat is worse , they can make you lose confidence in yourself and your abilities .\nSuccessful people know their worth and their value ; as a result , they do not allow themselves to believe the negative words of toxic people .\nNo matter what you may do to protect yourself from negative energy , you are bound to get hurt at one point or another .\nWhen this happens to successful people , they learn from their experiences and make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same situation again .\nMore importantly , with every experience , they learn something new about how to handle a toxic person or a negative situation .", "author": "Lena Y.", "url":

relationship where friends and family of the wronged party must put their own grievances aside to save their loved one from a life of misery .\nThat time has now come for Prince Harry \u2019 s relatives .\nAn intervention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited likelihood of success , to try and protect the troubled Duke and talk to the couple to sort out fact from fiction .\nBecause it \u2019 s now abundantly clear to anyone that Meghan Markle appears to have no grip on reality and is on a mission to take down the Royal Family , no matter the cost .\nThe emotionally vulnerable Harry \u2013 once a popular and affable chap \u2013 appears to have been transported into an alternate universe that is embarrassing and damaging to all parties , especially the monarchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former actress \u2019 s latest unhinged tirade against the Royal Family and Britain for The Cut magazine to promote her new Spotify podcast that features a catalogue of distortions .\nAs the dutiful 96-year-old Queen fights for her health , thousands die in flooding in the Commonwealth country of Pakistan , and Britain is gripped by a cost-of-living crisis , Meghan appears to be on a mission to cause maximum damage to her British relatives by deploying dubious \u2018 truth bombs \u2019 .\nThe issue is that most of her carefully designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nLike her mistaken claim that she wouldn \u2019 t be able to drop Archie off at school in the UK without 40 photographers taking photos in a press pen .\nAnd this is where Wootton digs deeper into the issue : Er , the problem is , such a scenario is a total nonsense \u2013 Prince William and Kate drop off and pick up their three children , including a future king , at school virtually every day , without one photograph being published in the British media .\nThere \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures , the Cambridge \u2019 s have made the decision , on very rare occasions , to allow photos to be taken officially , but that is a personal choice that could have easily been rejected by the Sussexes .\nWhen she \u2019 s asked in the interview about Thomas Markle , she seemingly uses the opportunity to publicly decimate Harry \u2019 s relationship with his own dad Prince Charles .\nRecounting a private conversation with her husband , she says : \u2018 Harry said to me , \u2018 I lost my dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t have to be the same for them as it was for me , but that \u2019 s his decision.\n\u2019 However , Meghan \u2019 s pitiful PR bloke Omid Scobie has since clarified : But , either way , the situation is dire .\nWhen the author Allison P Davis asks if \u2018 Harry feels isolated without any family nearby \u2019 , Meghan again changes the subject to make it about her , responding : When it comes to Megxit , of course , none of the problems were Meghan \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hands-on American apparently .\nShe groans about being unable to remain working royals while raking in millions from major corporations , laughably claiming : The journalist takes issue with Meghan Markle \u2019 s seeming ungratefulness towards the Royal Family : Name me a working member of the Royal Family able to do this let alone one prepared to slag off their relatives for a massive pay day \u2013 they don \u2019 t exist .\nIt \u2019 s just more nonsense .\nEven more risibly , Meghan makes it clear she believes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she maintains a thinly veiled threat to release more damaging information if she doesn \u2019 t get her own way .\nNo , I don \u2019 t like it one bit .\nIt \u2019 s blatantly obvious what you \u2019 re trying to do .\nHarry also makes a cameo appearance to trash his family once again while giving the magazine a tour of the couple \u2019 s gigantic home office , where the chairs behind their shared desks have been positioned to look like thrones .\nThe delusion is ramped up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the couple \u2019 s Keeping Up With The Kardashians-style reality show , which she claims is actually a historical documentary .\nPass me the sick bucket .\nShe also describes their relationship as being \u2018 like salt and pepper .\nWe always move together.\n\u2019 But perhaps the most ridiculous moment comes when Meghan shares a story of a visit to the 2019 London premiere of The Lion King stage show , where a South African cast member compares her to Nelson Mandela .\nThe tone deafness of the post-Megxit Sussexes is clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waxes lyrical about her $ 14 million Montecito mansion , featuring a massive grand piano housewarming present from her rich new mate Tyler Perry in her sitting room to \u2018 write the soundtrack for your life \u2019 .\nMeghan says they decided to purchase the Beverly Hills country club-style home before stepping foot inside , explaining on a stroll around the garden : Wootton is of the mind that Meghan Markle spells deep trouble for Prince Harry and the Royals : It \u2019 s easy to try and ignore Meghan \u2019 s constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , this is the first of many woe-is-me interviews planned to plug her Spotify show \u2013 but it \u2019 s critical the Royal Family read the nonsense tell-all in full to discover just how far down their own rabbit hole the Sussexes now find themselves .\nIt \u2019 s obvious to me they no longer have a shred of respect for the Queen or the monarchy , an institution they seem to wish to damage , even as they continue to profit off their connection to it .\nThat \u2019 s why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peacemaker Kate in tow , should board a plane to California .\nI know there \u2019 s a million reasons why such an idea would be dismissed as preposterous and impossible , especially given the chance of getting through to Harry seems close to nil \u2013 he \u2019 s co-pilot of this kamikaze mission , after all .\nBut at least they would have tried everything , on behalf of the Queen , the institution she has worked her life to protect and the country she loves , to save Harry from this @

other tissues , which results in fertility and longevity issues .\nDuring a Life Itself event , Jennifer Garrison , an assistant professor at the California Buck Institute for Research on Aging , said of the issue : \u201c Ovaries are very strange , very odd in terms of the rest of the human body .\nWe can think about them like an accelerated model for human aging.\n\u201d \u201c When a woman is in

usual age of natural menopause in the is US is 51 , as per the North American Menopause Society .\nBut what if there was a scientific solution to this problem ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 20 weeks gestation ,

somewhere around your mother \u2019 s birth , her tiny ovaries only contained 1 to 2 million eggs , as per the American College @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of oocytes happens to many animal species .\nAccording to research , this could be a natural step in fetal growth and development .\nBy the time girls get to the puberty stage , they only have around 300,000 to 400,000 immature eggs left .\nDuncan went on to say : As we age , the decline escalates , and for most women , only 12 % of their eggs will still be intact by 30 years of age , and only around 3 % at 40 , as per a January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end up with barely functional ovaries by the time they reach 30 ?\nThe answer to this question has not been answered , and Garrison said that , \u201c learning about how little we know about why that happens infuriated me actually.\n\u201d One of the reasons may be a lack of funding for such research .\nGarrison also believes that general research largely ignored females : But fortunately

professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern \u2019 s Feinberg School of Medicine .\nQuestions of such importance need answers .\nThanks to investors , Garrison has established the Center for Reproductive Longevity and Equality , which finances research to put the discovery on the underlying causes of accelerated aging in the ovaries on a fast track .\nGarrison went on to say : The truth is , we are far from understanding why exactly women go through menopause , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies operate in such a way .\nThose are orcas , pilot whales , narwhals , and beluga whales .\n\u201c Why does a woman \u2019 s reproductive span correlate with her overall life span ?\nEven brothers of women who go through menopause later tend to live longer , \u201d Garrison continued .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a genetic component there that \u2019 s clearly very important , and we don \u2019 t understand it at all.\n\u201d \u201c It \u2019 s not a moon shot \u2014 a moon shot would
