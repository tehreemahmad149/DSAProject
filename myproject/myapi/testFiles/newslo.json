and it \u2019 s hassle-free , making it a great option for many .\nTo help you decide whether applying for a personal loan is the most viable option for you , we explain what it is and look at some of the pros and cons associated with such an arrangement .\nThere are various aspects to a personal loan , including : \u2022 You borrow an agreed amount of money that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lump sum \u2022 You

instances , the application process is straightforward , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money within just 48 hours .\nThe Difference Between Secured And Unsecured Personal Loans It \u2019 s important to note that a personal loan can be secured or unsecured .\nA secured loan is one that takes something ( usually your home ) as \u2018 security \u2019 in case you default on your loan repayments .\nUnsecured loans don \u2019 t require anything in return as a security deposit and are much more attractive to borrowers than secured loans .\nThey \u2019 re common for amounts of up to \u00a320,000 .\nThere are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : \u2022 Spreading the cost of purchases : If you \u2019 re looking to make a big purchase , securing a personal loan enables you to spread its cost over a long period of time .\nThis means you don \u2019 t have to empty your savings to buy what you want or need .\n\u2022 Flexible and can be used for multiple purposes : One of the best things about personal loans is that you can use them for a wide variety of purposes .\nPeople often use them to buy cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay off more expensive forms of debt .\n\u2022 Improve your credit score : Taking out credit and paying it off on time will improve your credit score in the long run .\nThis is great news if you \u2019 re looking for larger forms of credit \u2013 like a mortgage \u2013 any time in the future .\n\u2022 Debt consolidation : Personal loans are an excellent way to consolidate debt .\nIf you have multiple expensive forms of credit , you can bring them all together into one monthly payment .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ensures you can keep on top of your repayments .\n\u2022 No collateral ( for unsecured loans ) : Unsecured loans don \u2019 t require any collateral , meaning they \u2019 re less risky to borrowers .\nThis means that you don \u2019 t stand to lose your house if you can \u2019 t meet the repayments .\n\u2022 Fixed-term repayments : The payment terms of a fixed loan stipulate that you

are generally an excellent way to access credit and will benefit most people , they \u2019 re not perfect .\nAnd here \u2019 s why : \u2022 High-interest rates : Personal loans aren \u2019 t the cheapest type of credit , and the interest rates will be determined by your credit score .\nIn most cases , it \u2019 s at least 8 % for \u00a35,000 .\nWhile such a rate is better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might not be as good as store credit where you can get it , so it \u2019 s always worth looking around before applying for a loan .\n\u2022 Extra fees : Although uncommon , some lenders apply compulsory fees for uncommon loans and charge money if you settle early .\nKoyo Loans is one lender that doesn \u2019 t charge a penalty for doing so , meaning you can settle the loan whenever you like .\n\u2022 Fixed payments are required : Although fixed payments are helpful for some people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you \u2019 re paying off a credit card , for instance , you can vary your monthly

with a personal loan and struggle to pay it back , you will be charged fees for missed payments , increasing your debts .\nIf you plan to borrow money , make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back .\n\u2022 Larger amounts require security : For anything over \u00a320,000 , you will probably need to apply for a secured loan .\nIf you fail to make repayments on a secured loan , you risk losing your house , so make sure it \u2019 s the best option for your current financial situation .\nUnsecured personal loans are an excellent way to borrow money and will be ideal for most borrowers .\nHowever , as we

you can choose to be employed by your business \u2019 s salespeople .\nThis is a well-known sales technique and one that is employed across a range of organisations all over the world .\nThere are numerous different types of upselling techniques \u2014 and they can be tailored to suit your business \u2019 s products and services .\nSimply put , upselling involves a salesperson persuading a customer to purchase a higher-tier product \u2014 for example , \u2018 supersizing \u2019 their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knives rather than a single knife .\nThere are a range of incentives that can be pitched to customers in order to achieve successful upselling .\nA more expensive product may have more features and uses than a standard , cheaper item \u2014 or , if a particular product also comes in a set , the customer may receive \u2018 more bang for their buck \u2019 .\nThis means that the items that make up the set may be more expensive to purchase individually than as part of the \u2018 deal

as link-selling , this method is not dissimilar to upselling , but it usually involves the salesperson promoting products that are associated with the item a customer is already planning to purchase .\nFor example , if a customer wishes to buy a wallet , the salesperson may inform them that there is also a belt \u2014 or a pair of sunglasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives the customer the opportunity to coordinate their accessories , while the brand makes a greater profit .\nAnother example of cross-selling is seen in certain hospitality venues , where customers are asked if they would like a

form a particular relationship with the customer that allows them to better understand their needs , preferences and \u2018 pain points \u2019 .\nThe first step in relationship selling is to establish an honest and positive rapport with each potential customer .\nNext , the salesperson must establish a strong sense of their own expertise and encourage a sense of trust in their product or brand .\nThis may be achieved by putting the customer \u2019 s doubts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or by presenting a few surprising or interesting facts .\nAfter this , the salesperson must develop an understanding

work to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumvent or overcome the barriers they may have between themselves and the purchase of the product .\nIn following this process , the overall aim is to reveal how the product \u2014 or even the brand \u2014 will add value to the customer \u2019 s life , therefore persuading that customer to make the necessary purchase .\nThis sales technique is developing and changing all the time .\nFollowing a business news outlet will help you to stay abreast of the most recent developments when it comes to relationship selling .\nSelling against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This method of selling involves persuading reluctant customers to invest in a particular product or service by tackling \u2018 status quo bias \u2019 .\nUsing this technique , a salesperson may be able to convince a customer to end their irrational attachment to a certain brand or position by presenting certain information about their own products .\nFor example , a salesperson may learn that the customer has concerns about a product \u2019 s effect on the environment .\nTo that end , the salesperson may be able to convince that customer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the one that they are promoting has fewer air miles .\nThere is a huge spectrum of sales techniques that can be easily tailored to your business .\nIn fact , everywhere you look online , you will find lists upon lists of excellent tips on how to close a sale and achieve the best possible results from the interaction .\nHowever , the most effective salesperson is one who has been trained to carefully read each situation independently and can therefore choose the most suitable approach themselves .\nThere are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help ambitious individuals to develop their understanding of matters of this kind .\nFor example , it is possible to easily attain a masters in business & management online with Aston University , which has six intakes per year .\nThis means that your employees can study for a new qualification
