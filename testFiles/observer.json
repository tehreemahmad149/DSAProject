Congress: Arts and Culture Are in Peril", "content": "On January 19 , the House Small Business Committee held a remote hearing , \u201c The Power , Peril , and Promise of the Creative Economy , \u201d in which performing arts advocates spoke to members of congress on the needs of their industry : a sector that has been in danger of collapse since March of 2020 .\nThe hearing had been partially organized by Be An # ArtsHero , a volunteer-run organization that defines itself as , \u201c an intersectional grassroots campaign for proportionate relief to the arts and culture sector of the American economy.\n\u201d Carson Elrod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , told Observer that the organization began as a viral hashtag campaign in the summer of 2020 to educate people on just how badly the creative economy had been hurt by the pandemic .\nThey wanted people to know how important it was that congress offer proportional relief .\nAccording to the National Endowment for the Arts and Bureau of Economic Analysis , the arts and culture industry contributed nearly a trillion dollars a year to GDP in 2019 ; however , during the pandemic , this sector had not received the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn the summer of 2020 , with Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation ( FPUC ) about to come to an end , Be An # ArtsHero \u2019 s volunteers\u2013who had individually lost work as a result of the pandemic\u2013were looking through their contact lists to find people with large platforms willing to strategically tweet their message about proportional relief for arts workers .\nThey gave their group its name because The Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions , or \u2018 Heroes \u2019 Act , a pandemic stimulus package , was being considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the act would pass by Labor Day of 2020 , and they hoped it would contain a relief component for the arts and culture sector .\nBut Labor Day passed , congress was deadlocked , and FPUC benefits ended .\nIt was at this point that Be An # ArtsHero decided to change from a social media campaign into a lobbying group .\nBe An # ArtsHero \u2019 s organizers contacted senators up for reelection to remind them that every state had tens of thousands of arts workers who helped generate billions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office to office giving the same \u201c Power , Peril , Promise \u201d presentation : telling senators how big the creative economy is , how much danger it was in , and how high its rate of return could be if properly invested in .\nDescribing the \u201c promise \u201d part of their pitch , Carson Elrod , actor and co-founder of Be An # ArtsHero , told Observer that he believes that art could be what anchors the American economy post-pandemic .\n\u201c There \u2019 s going to be so much pent-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their homes and into community with each other.\n\u201d Holding the congressional hearing was Be An # ArtsHero \u2019 s long-term lobbying goal .\nOver the course of the pandemic , the organization came a long way .\nWhere once they got celebrity contacts to tweet about the needs of arts workers , now they have spoken to congress about specific federal dollars that could be earmarked for their sector .\nSpeaking to Observer , Matthew-Lee Erlbach , another co-founder of Be An # ArtsHero , pointed to two billion dollars in funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get reappropriated for the performing arts .\nDuring the hearing , Carson Elrod lobbied for a super package of legislation , including The Creative Economy Revitalization Act and The 21st Century Federal Writers Project .\nThey are also pushing for the creation of a Secretary for Arts and Culture in the presidential cabinet .\nTheir prolific , multi-pronged lobbying goals have the scope and spirit of a 30s-era New Deal-style program .\nAmidst the failure of Democratic leadership to pass the already watered-down relief provisions in the Build Back Better Act , Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly ambitious .\nThe organizers , however , are undaunted .\n\u201c If there \u2019 s a problem that needs the kitchen sink thrown at it then you throw the kitchen sink at it , \u201d Carson Elrod told Observer .\nThese organizers take inspiration from the National Independent Venue Association , also present at the congressional hearing , which successfully lobbied congress to pass the Save Our Stages Act and enabled shuttered venues to apply for grants worth 45 % of their lost revenue .\nElrod calls its passage a \u201c Revolutionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a bipartisan way , looked at the creative economy and understood that these independent venues anchored dynamic local economies .\nThey needed help , or they were going to disappear forever.\n\u201d The January 19 hearing itself included four witnesses : alongside Carson Elrod was Nataki Garrett , Artistic Director of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival ; Sandra Karas , Secretary-Treasurer of Actors \u2019 Equity Association ; and Raeanne Presley , Co-Owner of Presley \u2019 s Theater in Branson , Missouri , and representative from the National Independent Venue Association .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far the performing arts were from being fully recovered from the pandemic .\nHe described having plays he had been cast in for the 2021/2022 season canceled due to COVID .\nNataki Garrett spoke at the hearing of feeling haunted by the employees she \u2019 d had to lay off during the pandemic , and the devastation that a lack of funding in the arts and arts education has on artists , on children in school , and on local economies .\nFunding the arts was a no brainer , she said during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognizing a simple fact that the arts and the artists drive local economies and at the same time lift people out of darkness.\n\u201d The witnesses overall framed relief for the arts as a bipartisan issue , impacting businesses and unionized employees alike .\nCarson Elrod , speaking to Observer , brought that same cross-party framing into future plans for Be An # ArtsHero .\nHe described wanting to develop the group into a big tent membership-based organization , like the ACLU or NRA in size and scope .\nThe organization , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves an arts worker , from theatre owners to theatre concessions workers .\nHollywood directors like JJ Abrams could join , as could IATSE stagehands .\nHe described an organization that could become an easy way for anyone in the sector to get politically involved .\nMatthew-Lee Erlbach described Be An # ArtsHero as a group which can change how Americans think of the arts and artists .\nHe told Observer , \u201c We \u2019 ve either been considered coastal elites or lazy layabouts , when the truth of the matter is we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who work really hard and happen to be extremely passionate about what we do and are highly skilled .\nThe challenge is rewriting that narrative.\n\u201d While the arts have been a divisive political issue historically , Erlbach sees the arts as a means of bringing the two parties together .\nFunding the arts , he says , isn \u2019 t a political issue , but rather an economic necessity for the nation \u2019 s small businesses .\n\u201c Our institutions are stars that anchor this interdependent local commercial ecosystem , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these stars implodes , all of the arts related businesses , not to mention retail , transportation , hospitality\u2014that all gets sucked into that black hole as well.\n\u201d After nearly two years of the pandemic , Americans already know what a nation without live performing arts looks like .\nFor Be An # ArtsHero , returning to that devastated landscape isn \u2019 t an option .\nThe pandemic has already changed the narrative around the arts and artists , and it is their hope that their lobbying , in shaping that transforming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sector .", "author": "Annie Levin", "url":

researchers predicting there \u2019 s an approximately a 50 percent chance the U.S. will experience another Covid-like pandemic in the next 25 years , the Biden administration is working out the details of a new National Biodefense Strategy it hopes will do a better job at containing dangerous germs than the last time around .\nWhile no one outside of the administration knows exactly what is in the new plan , experts expect it will build on the previously released American Pandemic Preparedness Plan for which the administration requested $ 88.2 billion in funding from Congress .\nThere are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will shift management for a crisis from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to the White House in an attempt to avoid the power struggles between agencies that gummed up the government \u2019 s Covid response .\n\u201c The bottom line is that we know what it takes to prevent and essentially take outbreaks off the table as a threat to society , \u201d Andrew Hebbeler , the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy \u2019 s principal assistant director for health and life science , told Bloomberg .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to date that aims to do that.\n\u201d It \u2019 s the shifting of power away from the CDC and to the White House that worries pandemic experts .\n\u201c The bottom line is it \u2019 s not a good idea , \u201d said Peter Hotez , a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine .\n\u201c This sends a vote of no-confidence in the CDC.\n\u201d Hotez is most concerned about the possibility the White House ends up in charge of pandemic responses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen what happened with the Trump White House , \u201d he said .\n\u201c It allowed political influence to affect the pandemic response .\nThat \u2019 s one reason you want this based anywhere but Washington , DC.\n\u201d Noting all the failings with the initial response to the pandemic , Hotez said , \u201c at every turn the CDC came up small .\nMy frustration is that the Biden White House seems unprepared to do the hard work of working with the CDC director to fix \u201d the agency .\nMaybe fixing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of its functions , Hotez said .\n\u201c The one thing you should be able to expect from the CDC is it should know how to lead a pandemic response , \u201d he added .\n\u201c This looks like a band aid .\nCreating a shadow CDC based in DC is the wrong direction to go in.\n\u201d William Schaffner , an infectious disease specialist and a professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center , applauded the administration \u2019 s commitment to addressing the mistakes made during the initial response to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned from that , \u201d Schaffner said .\nOne of the government \u2019 s biggest failings was the lack of coordination between the various federal agencies , Schaffner said .\nAnd clearly that is why the plan is to make the White House the command center in a pandemic response , he added .\nIn the past , \u201c the CDC has been on the point of responses to pandemics , \u201d Schaffner said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s clear that the CDC was diminished in its response for a variety of reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important player , but it doesn \u2019 t put it in the lead .\nThat \u2019 s one of the things that concerns me .\nAnything that comes out of Washington has political overtones .\nYou can \u2019 t avoid it.\n\u201d Ultimately , Schaffner said , \u201c the devil is in the details .\nI don \u2019 t know the details .\nBut I \u2019 m
