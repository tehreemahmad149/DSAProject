television channel .\nStatements in Russian media indicate that urgent communications may be taking place on this .\nSuch a meeting , if it materializes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no Russia-Ukraine war anytime in the near future .\nAs for other comments of US Defense Secretary Austin , he appears to be in agreement that there \u2019 s a diplomatic way forward .\n\u201c Conflict is not inevitable

Saturday morning hours , both the US and Russians appear to be drawing down and evacuating their embassies in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev in what \u2019 s the most ominous sign yet that military confrontation could be on the horizon .\n\u201c The United States is set to evacuate its embassy in Kyiv as Western intelligence officials warn that a Russian invasion of Ukraine is increasingly imminent , \u201d The Associated Press reports Saturday .\n\u201c U.S .\nofficials said the State Department plans to announce early Saturday that virtually all American staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave ahead of a feared Russian invasion.\n\u201d \u201c A small number of officials may remain in Kyiv but the vast majority of the almost 200 Americans at the embassy will be sent out or relocated to Ukraine \u2019 s far west , near the Polish border , so the U.S. can retain a diplomatic presence in the country.\n\u201d The US Embassy confirmed it has ordered all non-essential staff to depart the country immediately , also all US national in the country have been urged to leave .\n\u201c Military action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warning , \u201d the US has said .\nRussia \u2019 s Foreign Ministry too has confirmed it \u2019 s reducing its diplomatic presence in the country , including its embassy and consulates .\nA statement says Moscow fears \u201c possible provocations from the Kyiv regime or third countries \u201d that could \u201c seriously complicate the security situation.\n\u201d We are indeed entering uncharted territory with this ratcheting situation , which escalated in earnest with Friday afternoon accusations from the White House that Russia will invade within days\u2026 : Both the US and Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are scheduled to hold an urgent phone call Saturday at the request of Washington .\nThe White House earlier said it is \u201c trying to stop a war \u201d .\nBelow is Russia \u2019 s full reaction to the afternoon \u2019 s White House press briefing and flurry of statements from officials alleging Putin has made the decision to invade Ukraine within \u201c days \u201d \u2026 Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova slammed reports Friday about Russia \u2019 s \u201c imminent invasion \u201d of Ukraine as a \u201c mass disinformation campaign \u201d against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more revealing than ever .\nThe Anglo-Saxons need a war .\nAt any cost .\nProvocations , disinformation , and threats are favorite methods of solving their own problems , \u201d she wrote in a post on her Telegram channel .\n\u201c Road roller of the American military-political machine is ready to go through people \u2019 s lives .\nThe whole world is watching how militarism , imperial ambitions denounce themselves .\nAnd a propaganda brigade chaired by Bloomberg serving all this.\n\u201d Zakharova said the position of Western officials \u201c in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia \u201d is worth a separate mention \u2014 avoiding giving a proper assessment of what is happening , the authorities validate their involvement in \u201c fakes.\n\u201d \u201c We can talk about the collusion of the authorities of Western countries and the media in order to escalate artificial tension around Ukraine by the massive and coordinated publication of false information in geopolitical interests , in particular , to distract attention from their own aggressive actions , \u201d she wrote .\nupdate ( 4:05pmET ) : Despite the as usual contradictory messaging out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serving up another dose of afternoon panic and market turmoil on the news Russia will invade Ukraine in a matter of days ( it \u2019 s been \u201c days \u201d and \u201c imminent \u201d for multiple weeks at this point ) , nothing seems to have actually changed on the ground at the Russia-Ukraine border\u2026 though Blinken has claimed Russian troops have moved closer to the border .\nMultiple White House officials are currently telling various major US news outlets that the US now believes Putin has made the decision to attack Ukraine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jake Sullivan still presented a confused picture\u2026 on the one hand telling US citizens to exit Ukraine immediately as a military offensive is nigh , but on the other cautioning he \u2019 s still not sure Putin has made the final decision .\nAnd now once again Moscow is \u201c calling bullshit \u201d .\nLate at night Friday local time , the Kremlin responded to the latest headline panic-fest in the aftermath of the White House afternoon briefing , calling the new \u2018 predictions \u2019 yet more US \u201c disinformation \u201d .. according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s Secretary of State Blinken from earlier in the day : There are reports that the US Embassy in Kiev is literally phoning US national directly , urging their departure : The EU has said it will not reduce diplomatic staff in the country , however , other countries are telling their nationals to leave , including Israel and the UK : Biden is now reportedly seeking to hold an urgent phone call with Putin .\n\u201c US President Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin will speak on Saturday , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And with all this , a little Saturday humor is in order\u2026 update ( 2:51pmET ) : The White House is now telling Americans in Ukraine to get out of the country \u201c immediately \u201d \u2013 giving a 24 to 48 hour time frame to make a safe exit .\nNational Security Adviser Jake Sullivan urged all US citizens in Ukraine \u201c to depart immediately.\n\u201d The number of Americans in the country is often estimated in the tens of thousands \u2013 likely somewhere around 30,000 \u2013 including dual citizens .\n\u201c We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point .\nAny American in Ukraine should leave as soon as possible and in any event , in the next 24 to 48 hours , \u201d Sullivan said .\n\u201c We obviously can not predict the future .\nWe don \u2019 t know exactly what is going to happen , but the risk is now high enough and the threat is now immediate enough.\n\u201d If they stay , Americans \u201c are assuming risk with no guarantee that there will be any other opportunity to leave and no prospect of a US Military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invasion , \u201d he added .\n\u201c It is the time to leave now , \u201d he said .\n\u201c We are in the window when an invasion could begin at any time should Vladimir Putin decide to order it.\n\u201d Sullivan also in the afternoon press briefing said it \u2019 s US intelligence \u2019 s belief that Putin could launch an invasion by the end of the Olympics\u2026 As oil spiked and markets tumbled , there was this to follow all the panicked warnings coming out of the White House\u2026 \u201c but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t know whether Russia has decided either way , \u201d according to the WSJ .\nThough it \u2019 s unclear what precisely on the ground has actually changed , President Biden is urging all Americans in Ukraine to \u201c leave now \u201d .\n\u201c American citizens should leave now , \u201d Biden said while discussing the Russian troop build-up threatening Ukraine in a new NBC News interview .\nThe president warned that \u201c things could go crazy quickly \u201d in the region and so it \u2019 s necessary that US citizens initiate plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further described in the interview set to air in full later in the day , \u201c It \u2019 s not like we \u2019 re dealing with a terrorist organization .\nWe \u2019 re dealing with one of the largest armies in the world .\nIt \u2019 s a very different situation and things could go crazy quickly.\n\u201d However , elsewhere in the interview he suggested that it \u2019 s anything but certain that President Putin has made his intentions clear .\nBiden told NBC that if if Putin \u201c foolish enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough not to \u2026do anything that would negatively impact on American citizens.\n\u201d Earlier this week the Pentagon revealed plans to stage a logistics operation along the Polish-Ukrainian border , just inside Poland , that would assist in any potential large-scale evacuation of US citizens from Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion .\nBiden addressed the possibility further with NBC : Biden said during his NBC interview that \u201c there \u2019 s not \u201d a situation that could prompt him to send US troops to rescue Americans attempting to exit Ukraine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a world war when Americans and Russia start shooting at one another.\n\u201d Already some 2,000 additional US troops have been sent from Fort Bragg and Germany to Poland in order to put in place the necessary logistics for an evacuation .\nMeanwhile , the US State Department is still warning against all American travel to Ukraine .\nFurther it re-issued a travel advisory from last month citing \u201c increased threats of Russian military action \u201d which makes it necessary for US citizens to depart .\nThe advisory warns Americans they must \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be able to evacuate US citizens in the event of Russian military action anywhere in Ukraine.\n\u201d Without doubt , the US administration still has the Afghan evacuation deadly debacle looming in the background .\nThere \u2019 s still said to be US citizens and dual nationals stuck in Taliban-run Afghanistan as a result of efforts which were too little , too late .\nUkraine \u2019 s government has at the same time sought to cool the Washington rhetoric , saying it \u2019 s causing unnecessary panic within Ukraine \u2019 s population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy with Biden \u2019 s latest words telling Americans to depart the country , which Zelensky himself has said is premature and overly alarmist .\nOriginally published on Zero hedge , republished here with permission .", "author": "The Mind

points were evaluated and determined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Phi , which is 1.618 , \u201d the research adds .\nAccording to Dr. Julian De Silva , who runs the Centre for Advanced Facial Cosmetic & Plastic Surgery in London .\nThe stats don \u2019 t lie .\nWith 91.39 percent , Kim Kardashian \u2019 s face came in second , followed by Kate Moss \u2019 s with 91.06 percent , Blurred Lines model Emily Ratajkowski \u2019 s with 90.8 percent , and Kendall Jenner \u2019 s 90.18 percent accuracy of her characteristics to the beauty ratio Phi in fifth place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Phi ratio of 1.618 has long been thought to hold the secret for beauty , but now with the computer mapping we can calculate how it applies to real women .\nAfter we had created the software and the algorithms for the key marker points on the face I thought it would be a good idea to test the system on some of the most beautiful women in the world and see if we could prove with geometry and science exactly what it is that makes a beautiful face .\nThe results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and models have facial features that come close to the ancient Greek principles for physical perfection.\n\u201d Here are the primary conclusions of Dr. De Silva \u2019 s research : 1.618 is a good value to aim for when figuring out the ideal nose size .\nTo do so , measure how long your nose is ( starting at the middle of the eyebrows ) at its widest point and divide it by how broad your nose is at its widest point .\nThe proper spacing of the eyes is likewise a ratio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , divided by the length of the eye should equal 1.618 .\nAlso , the location of the eyes with respect to the rest of the face is computed .\nThe distance from the nose to the edge of the eye , divided by the distance from the edge of the eye to the corner of the lips should equal 1.618 .\nCalculating the ideal lip size , the bottom lip \u2019 s surface area should be 1.618 times that of the top lip \u2019 s surface area .\nThen the length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the distance at the base of the nose = 1.618 .\nIn the end , you \u2019 ll need to know how far your lips are from your nose by measuring the corner of the lip to the opposite corner of the nose .\nThen , divide by length of the base of the nose = 1.618", "author": "Jade Small", "url":

, they have two options .\nThey can search for civilization , or they could make themselves easy to spot by building a fire or writing HELP in big letters .\nFor scientists interested in the question of whether intelligent aliens exist , the options are much the same .\nFor over 70 years , astronomers have been scanning for radio or optical signals from other civilizations in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence , called SETI .\nMost scientists are confident that life exists on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worlds in the Milky Way galaxy .\nAstronomers also think there is a decent chance some life forms have developed intelligence and technology .\nBut no signals from another civilization have ever been detected , a mystery that is called \u201c The Great Silence \u201c .\nWhile SETI has long been a part of mainstream science , METI , or messaging extraterrestrial intelligence , has been less common .\nI \u2019 m a professor of astronomy who has written extensively about the search for life in the Universe .\nI also serve on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization that \u2019 s designing messages to send to extraterrestrial civilizations .\nIn the coming months , two teams of astronomers are going to send messages into space in an attempt to communicate with any intelligent aliens who may be out there listening .\nThese efforts are like building a big bonfire in the woods and hoping someone finds you .\nBut some people question whether it is wise to do this at all .\nEarly attempts to contact life off Earth were quixotic messages in a bottle .\nIn 1972 , NASA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying a plaque with a line drawing of a man and a woman and symbols to show where the craft originated .\nIn 1977 , NASA followed this up with the famous Golden Record attached to the Voyager 1 spacecraft .\nThese spacecraft \u2013 as well as their twins , Pioneer 11 and Voyager 2 \u2013 have now all left the Solar System .\nBut in the immensity of space , the odds that these or any other physical objects will be found are fantastically minuscule .\nElectromagnetic radiation is a much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio message designed for alien ears from the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico in 1974 .\nThe series of 1s and 0s was designed to convey simple information about humanity and biology and was sent toward the globular cluster M13 .\nSince M13 is 25,000 light-years away , you shouldn \u2019 t hold your breath for a reply .\nIn addition to these purposeful attempts at sending a message to aliens , wayward signals from television and radio broadcasts have been leaking into space for nearly a century .\nThis ever-expanding bubble of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars .\nBut there is a big difference between a focused blast of radio waves from a giant telescope and diffuse leakage \u2013 the weak signal from a show like I Love Lucy fades below the hum of radiation left over from the Big Bang soon after it leaves the Solar System .\nNearly half a century after the Arecibo message , two international teams of astronomers are planning new attempts at alien communication .\nOne is using a giant new radio telescope , and the other is choosing a compelling new target @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sent from the world \u2019 s largest radio telescope , in China , sometime in 2023 .\nThe telescope , with a 1,640-foot ( 500-meter ) diameter , will beam a series of radio pulses over a broad swath of sky .\nThese on-off pulses are like the 1s and 0s of digital information .\nThe message is called \u201c The Beacon in the Galaxy \u201d and includes prime numbers and mathematical operators , the biochemistry of life , human forms , the Earth \u2019 s location and a time stamp .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group of millions of stars near the center of the Milky Way galaxy , about 10,000 to 20,000 light-years from Earth .\nWhile this maximizes the pool of potential aliens , it means it will be tens of thousands of years before Earth may get a reply .\nThe other attempt is targeting only a single star , but with the potential for a much quicker reply .\nOn Oct. 4 , 2022 , a team from the Goonhilly Satellite Earth Station in England will beam a message toward the star TRAPPIST-1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three of which are Earth-like worlds in the so-called \u201c Goldilocks zone \u201d \u2013 meaning they could be home to liquid and potentially life , too .\nTRAPPIST-1 is just 39 light-years away , so it could take as few as 78 years for intelligent life to receive the message and Earth to get the reply .\nThe prospect of alien contact is ripe with ethical questions , and METI is no exception .\nThe first is : Who speaks for Earth ?\nIn the absence of any international consultation with the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and where to send it are in the hands of a small group of interested scientists .\nBut there is also a much deeper question .\nIf you are lost in the woods , getting found is obviously a good thing .\nWhen it comes to whether humanity should be broadcasting a message to aliens , the answer is much less clear-cut .\nBefore he died , iconic physicist Stephen Hawking was outspoken about the danger of contacting aliens with superior technology .\nHe argued that they could be malign and if given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity .\nOthers see no extra risk , since a truly advanced civilization would already know of our existence .\nAnd there is interest .\nRussian-Israeli billionaire Yuri Milner has offered US $ 1 million for the best design of a new message and an effective way to transmit it .\nTo date , no international regulations govern METI , so the experiments will continue , despite concerns .\nFor now , intelligent aliens remain in the realm of science fiction .\nBooks like The Three-Body Problem by Cixin Liu offer somber and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ METI efforts might look like .\nIt doesn \u2019 t end well for humanity in the books .\nIf humans ever do make contact in real life , I hope the aliens come in peace .\nThis article is republished

intelligence ( AI ) models can produce \u201c creative \u201d images on-demand based on a text prompt .\nThe likes of Imagen , MidJourney , and DALL-E 2 are beginning to change the way creative content is made with implications for copyright and intellectual property .\nWhile the output of these models is often striking , it \u2019 s hard to know exactly how they produce their results .\nLast week , researchers in the US made the intriguing claim that the DALL-E 2 model might have invented its own secret language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DALL-E 2 to create images containing text captions , then feeding the resulting ( gibberish ) captions back into the system , the researchers concluded DALL-E 2 thinks Vicootes means \u201c vegetables \u201c , while Wa ch zod rea refers to \u201c sea creatures that a whale might eat \u201c .\nThese claims are fascinating , and if true , could have important security and interpretability implications for this kind of large AI model .\nSo what exactly is going on ?\nDALL-E 2 probably does not have a \u201c secret language \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it has its own vocabulary \u2013 but even then we can \u2019 t know for sure .\nFirst of all , at this stage it \u2019 s very hard to verify any claims about DALL-E 2 and other large AI models , because only a handful of researchers and creative practitioners have access to them .\nAny images that are publicly shared ( on Twitter for example ) should be taken with a fairly large grain of salt , because they have been \u201c cherry-picked \u201d by a human from among many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even those with access can only use these models in limited ways .\nFor example , DALL-E 2 users can generate or modify images , but can \u2019 t ( yet ) interact with the AI system more deeply , for instance by modifying the behind-the-scenes code .\nThis means \u201c explainable AI \u201d methods for understanding how these systems work can \u2019 t be applied , and systematically investigating their behavior is challenging .\nWhat \u2019 s going on then ?\nOne possibility is the \u201c gibberish \u201d phrases are related to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Apoploe , which seems to create images of birds , is similar to the Latin Apodidae , which is the binomial name of a family of bird species .\nThis seems like a plausible explanation .\nFor instance , DALL-E 2 was trained on a very wide variety of data scraped from the internet , which included many non-English words .\nSimilar things have happened before : large natural language AI models have coincidentally learned to write computer code without deliberate training .\nIs it all about the tokens ?\nOne point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that AI language models don \u2019 t read text the way you and I do .\nInstead , they break input text up into \u201c tokens \u201d before processing it .\nDifferent \u201c tokenization \u201d approaches have different results .\nTreating each word as a token seems like an intuitive approach , but causes trouble when identical tokens have different meanings ( like how \u201c match \u201d means different things when you \u2019 re playing tennis and when you \u2019 re starting a fire ) .\nOn the other hand , treating each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of possible tokens , but each one conveys much less meaningful information .\nDALL-E 2 ( and other models ) use an in-between approach called byte-pair encoding ( BPE ) .\nInspecting the BPE representations for some of the gibberish words suggests this could be an important factor in understanding the \u201c secret language \u201d .\nNot the whole picture The \u201c secret language \u201d could also just be an example of the \u201c garbage in , garbage out \u201d principle .\nDALL-E 2 can \u2019 t say \u201c I don \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about \u201d , so it will always generate some kind of image from the given input text .\nEither way , none of these options are complete explanations of what \u2019 s happening .\nFor instance , removing individual characters from gibberish words appears to corrupt the generated images in very specific ways .\nAnd it seems individual gibberish words don \u2019 t necessarily combine to produce coherent compound images ( as they would if there were really a secret \u201c language \u201d under the covers ) .\nWhy this is important Beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if any of this is actually important .\nThe answer is yes .\nDALL-E \u2019 s \u201c secret language \u201d is an example of an \u201c adversarial attack \u201d against a machine learning system : a way to break the intended behavior of the system by intentionally choosing inputs the AI doesn \u2019 t handle well .\nOne reason adversarial attacks are concerning is that they challenge our confidence in the model .\nIf the AI interprets gibberish words in unintended ways , it might also interpret meaningful words in unintended ways .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ DALL-E 2 filters input text to prevent users from generating harmful or abusive content , but a

new generation of artificial intelligence ( AI ) models can produce \u201c creative \u201d images on-demand based on a text prompt .\nThe likes of Imagen , MidJourney , and DALL-E 2 are beginning to change the way creative content is made with implications for copyright and intellectual property .\nWhile the output of these models is often striking , it \u2019 s hard to know exactly how they produce their results .\nLast week , researchers in the US made the intriguing claim that the DALL-E 2 model might have invented its own secret language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DALL-E 2 to create images containing text captions , then feeding the resulting ( gibberish ) captions back into the system , the researchers concluded DALL-E 2 thinks Vicootes means \u201c vegetables \u201c , while Wa ch zod rea refers to \u201c sea creatures that a whale might eat \u201c .\nThese claims are fascinating , and if true , could have important security and interpretability implications for this kind of large AI model .\nSo what exactly is going on ?\nDALL-E 2 probably does not have a \u201c secret language \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it has its own vocabulary \u2013 but even then we can \u2019 t know for sure .\nFirst of all , at this stage it \u2019 s very hard to verify any claims about DALL-E 2 and other large AI models , because only a handful of researchers and creative practitioners have access to them .\nAny images that are publicly shared ( on Twitter for example ) should be taken with a fairly large grain of salt , because they have been \u201c cherry-picked \u201d by a human from among many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even those with access can only use these models in limited ways .\nFor example , DALL-E 2 users can generate or modify images , but can \u2019 t ( yet ) interact with the AI system more deeply , for instance by modifying the behind-the-scenes code .\nThis means \u201c explainable AI \u201d methods for understanding how these systems work can \u2019 t be applied , and systematically investigating their behavior is challenging .\nWhat \u2019 s going on then ?\nOne possibility is the \u201c gibberish \u201d phrases are related to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Apoploe , which seems to create images of birds , is similar to the Latin Apodidae , which is the binomial name of a family of bird species .\nThis seems like a plausible explanation .\nFor instance , DALL-E 2 was trained on a very wide variety of data scraped from the internet , which included many non-English words .\nSimilar things have happened before : large natural language AI models have coincidentally learned to write computer code without deliberate training .\nIs it all about the tokens ?\nOne point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that AI language models don \u2019 t read text the way you and I do .\nInstead , they break input text up into \u201c tokens \u201d before processing it .\nDifferent \u201c tokenization \u201d approaches have different results .\nTreating each word as a token seems like an intuitive approach , but causes trouble when identical tokens have different meanings ( like how \u201c match \u201d means different things when you \u2019 re playing tennis and when you \u2019 re starting a fire ) .\nOn the other hand , treating each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of possible tokens , but each one conveys much less meaningful information .\nDALL-E 2 ( and other models ) use an in-between approach called byte-pair encoding ( BPE ) .\nInspecting the BPE representations for some of the gibberish words suggests this could be an important factor in understanding the \u201c secret language \u201d .\nNot the whole picture The \u201c secret language \u201d could also just be an example of the \u201c garbage in , garbage out \u201d principle .\nDALL-E 2 can \u2019 t say \u201c I don \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about \u201d , so it will always generate some kind of image from the given input text .\nEither way , none of these options are complete explanations of what \u2019 s happening .\nFor instance , removing individual characters from gibberish words appears to corrupt the generated images in very specific ways .\nAnd it seems individual gibberish words don \u2019 t necessarily combine to produce coherent compound images ( as they would if there were really a secret \u201c language \u201d under the covers ) .\nWhy this is important Beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if any of this is actually important .\nThe answer is yes .\nDALL-E \u2019 s \u201c secret language \u201d is an example of an \u201c adversarial attack \u201d against a machine learning system : a way to break the intended behavior of the system by intentionally choosing inputs the AI doesn \u2019 t handle well .\nOne reason adversarial attacks are concerning is that they challenge our confidence in the model .\nIf the AI interprets gibberish words in unintended ways , it might also interpret meaningful words in unintended ways .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ DALL-E 2 filters input text to prevent users from generating harmful or abusive content , but a \u201c secret language \u201d of gibberish words might allow users to circumvent these filters .\nRecent research has discovered adversarial \u201c trigger phrases \u201d for some language AI models \u2013 short nonsense phrases such as \u201c zoning tapping fiennes \u201d that can reliably trigger the models to spew out racist , harmful or biased content .\nThis research

to assert that they can communicate with the deceased have been uncovered by researchers .\nA high susceptibility to auditory hallucinations , a predisposition to high levels of absorption in tasks , and unusual auditory experiences in childhood are all things that occur more strongly in self-described clairaudient mediums than they do in the general population , according to research that was published in 2021 , according to Science Alert .\nAccording to the researchers , this discovery has the potential to improve our understanding of the distressing auditory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as schizophrenia .\nBoth anthropologists who study religious and spiritual experiences and scientists who study pathological hallucinatory experiences find the Spiritualist experiences of clairvoyance and clairaudience to be of great scientific interest .\nThese experiences involve seeing or hearing something in the absence of an external stimuli , and are attributed to the spirits of the dead .\nSpecifically , researchers would desire a better understanding of why some persons with auditory encounters report having a Spiritualist experience , while others find it more disturbing and are diagnosed with a mental health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c Spiritualists tend to report unusual auditory experiences which are positive , start early in life and which they are often then able to control , \u201d explained psychologist Peter Moseley of Northumbria University in the UK when the study was published .\n\u201c Understanding how these develop is important because it could help us understand more about distressing or non-controllable experiences of hearing voices too.\n\u201d He and his collaborator , psychologist Adam Powell of Durham University in the UK , recruited and surveyed a total of 65 clairaudient mediums from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union in addition to 143 members of the general population who were recruited through social media .\nThe goal of the study was to determine what set Spiritualists apart from the general population , who do not ( typically ) report hearing the voices of the dead .\nIt was found that , 44.6 percent of the Spiritualists stated they heard voices on a daily basis , and 79 percent said the encounters were a normal part of their existence .\nAnd although the majority of people said they heard the voices within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they also heard sounds coming from beyond their own bodies .\nThe survey \u2019 s findings were somewhat startling to say the least .\nWhen compared to the general population , those who identified as Spiritualists indicated a much greater level of belief in the supernatural and a lower propensity to care about what other people thought of them .\nIn general , Spiritualists had their first auditory encounter at a young age , with a median of 21.7 years old , and they reported a high degree of immersion .\nThis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorption in mental processes and activities , as well as altered states , as well as the degree to which a person is able to tune out the world around them .\nThey claimed that they were more susceptible to having experiences similar to hallucinations .\nThe researchers emphasized that previous to their encounters , they had not often heard of Spiritualism ; rather , they had came into it while searching for meanings .\nAlso , there was a significant correlation found between high levels of absorption and a strong believe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , there was little to no vulnerability to auditory hallucinations .\nThere was also no discernible difference in the degree to which individuals in either group believed in the supernatural or were prone to experiencing visual hallucinations .\nAccording to the researchers , these findings indicate that having an experience with the \u201c voices of the dead \u201d is thus unlikely to be the consequence of peer pressure , a favorable social setting , or suggestibility owing to believing in the paranormal .\nInstead , some people convert to Spiritualism because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and because it is consistent with their own experiences .\n\u201c Our findings say a lot about \u2018 learning and yearning \u2019 .\nFor our participants , the tenets of Spiritualism seem to make sense of both extraordinary childhood experiences as well as the frequent auditory phenomena they experience as practicing mediums , \u201d Powell said when the study was first published .\n\u201c But all of those experiences may result more from having certain tendencies or early abilities than from simply believing in the possibility of contacting the dead if one tries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The findings of the study were just published in the journal \u201c Mental Health , Religion and Culture.\n\u201c",

hangover after drinking the day before .\nBut can these pills really prevent a hangover ?\nA hangover is mainly due to the dehydrating effects of alcohol , which can give a headache .\nThe direct effect of alcohol on the stomach can also cause a sore stomach and nausea .\nIf less alcohol is taken into the body , the risks of being dehydrated are less .\nBut since the pills only work after alcohol has passed through the stomach to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcohol \u2019 s effect on the stomach .\nThe evidence for Myrkl is based on a single published research study .\nTwenty-four healthy young white adults were asked to take either two Myrkl pills or dummy pills ( placebo ) each day for seven days .\nThey were then given a small amount of alcohol ( between 50 and 90ml of spirits ) based on their weight .\nTheir blood alcohol level was tested for the next two hours .\nThe researchers found that within the first 60 minutes , the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower in those who received Myrkl

unanswered questions .\nDoes the pill work in people who are not young , healthy and white ?\nDoes it work in people with gut or liver disease ?\nAre there differences in the effect of the pill between men and women ?\nWhat happens when food and alcohol are taken together ?\nDo medications change the action of the pills ?\nIt is already known that friendly gut bacteria are changed by

Rigby , James Webb scientist , said during the broadcast .\nThe most remote galaxies reveal what they would have seemed to be more than 13.1 billion years ago , which is less than a billion years after the Big Bang .\nSince these galaxies are so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long to reach us , we are literally looking billions of years into our cosmic past .\nThe creation of stars requires a significant amount of dust from space .\nGreen galaxies are composed of hydrocarbon and other compounds in addition to hydrocarbon , whereas red or orange galaxies are encased in space dust .\nBlue galaxies , on the other hand , include stars but almost no dust at all .\nBecause of these substances , scientists are able to comprehend how galaxies are formed , how they combine with one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they cease to produce stars entirely .\nThis gigantic planet is almost exactly half as massive as Jupiter and is made up almost entirely of gases .\nIt is about 1,150 light-years distant from our home planet and completes one circle around its star every 3.4 days .\nAccording to Nicole Col\u00f3n , who is the Webb deputy project scientist for exoplanets , it is the first spectrum of an exoplanet that was captured by the telescope .\n\u201c We can tell there \u2019 s evidence of clouds and hazes , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large as we predicted , \u201d Col\u00f3n explained .\n\u201c We don \u2019 t expect that planet to be habitable ( it \u2019 s too hot , and it \u2019 s a gas giant , so no solid surface ) , \u201d cosmologist Katie Mack tweeted .\n\u201c But there \u2019 s hope we might observe atmospheres of more Earth-like planets in the future.\n\u201d Obtaining spectra is a fancy way of saying that the Webb captures light .\nIt is equipped with a component known as a Near-Infrared Spectrograph .\nThis breathtaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fades away in exquisite detail .\nThis growing cloud of gas is known as a planetary nebula , and it is currently around the dying remnants of a star .\nThe distance between it and Earth is around 2,000 light years , and it has a diameter of over half a light year .\nThe molecular nitrogen in the nebula is responsible for lighting up the gas that is around the star remnants , which is how you can see the nebula .\nThe blue haze is caused by hot , ionized gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature by the remnant core of the star .\nAn incredible 290 million light-years separates us from this cluster of five distant galaxies .\nEvery galaxy contains anything from millions to hundreds of billions of individual star systems .\nAs a result of the gravitational pull between them , they are engaged in an intimate , cosmic dance .\nIn addition , the galaxies are in the process of merging , which provides us with essential information on the development of enormous structures in the universe .\nEven in the middle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holes eating stuff .\nThis star nursery is located in the constellation Carina , which is about 7,600 light-years distant .\nIt is also one of the biggest and brightest objects seen in the sky .\nIt is also the home of huge stars , some of which have masses that are many times that of the Sun .\nThe breathtaking infrared picture reveals hundreds of new stars that have never been observed by humans before , as well as jets of boiling gases that are being released as new stars are created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different star , and these stars may each have their own planets circling around them .\nToday , during a live broadcast , the agency presented these mind-blowing observations , which included some of the deepest views of the universe we have ever seen .\nThis is a momentous occasion in the field of astronomy that has been in the works for decades , and it has now arrived .\nThe

@ the day , while our typical nighttime tendency is to sleep .\nFrom an evolutionary standpoint this actually makes a lot of sense .\nWhile the night is a fantastic time for relaxation , humans are

three times higher between the hours of midnight and six in the morning than at any other time of day .\nAccording to a study published in 2020 , nighttime wakefulness increases the risk of suicide

object in our solar system was \u2018 Oumuamua in 2017 , which was then followed by Borisov in 2018 .\nWhile Borisov clearly behaved like a comet , \u2018 Oumuamua was so bizarre that many astronomers thought it could be an alien spaceship .\nHowever , a few years before \u2018 Oumuamua was discovered , scientists thought they had detected an interstellar object that smashed into the Earth in 2014 .\nThe probable interstellar object , known as CNEOS 2014-01-08 , is thought to have been roughly half a meter in width .\nHarvard professor Avi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first to identify the object \u2019 s potential interstellar origins .\nNow , Loeb and Siraj have organized a team of scientists to retrieve the mysterious object from the bottom of the ocean off the coast of Papua New Guinea .\nUsing data from a catalog about the object \u2019 s path , Siraj and Loeb came to the conclusion that it might not be from our Solar System .\nThis is because the object had an unusually high heliocentric velocity , which means it was moving at speeds that indicate it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s gravity well .\nHaving said that , there is a catch .\nThe data utilized to measure the object \u2019 s impact with Earth came from a spy satellite that was operated by the U.S. Department of Defense , designed to monitor military activity on Earth .\nAs a consequence of this , the particular error values of the measurement are a closely guarded secret .\nAdditionally , the U.S. military is cautious about allowing the specific capabilities of their secret spy satellite to become publicly available information .\nBecause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community remain reluctant to formally designate CNEOS 2014-01-08 as an interstellar object in the absence of such information .\nAs a result , Siraj and Loeb \u2019 s paper is still unpublished because it hasn \u2019 t gone through peer review .\nThen on April 22 , 2022 , U.S. Space Force \u2019 s Space Operations Command Chief Scientist , Joel Mozer , examined the relevant classified material and strengthened their argument when he \u201c confirmed that the velocity estimate reported to NASA is sufficiently accurate to indicate an interstellar trajectory.\n\u201d Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it tumbled through Earth \u2019 s atmosphere , likely leaving behind only small pieces that are spread out across the bottom of the ocean just off the coast of Papua New Guinea .\nHowever , the pieces are likely to be magnetic , so a ship searching the ocean floor with a big magnet could potentially pick up the tiny pieces of interstellar object .\nSiraj and Loeb want to do this , so they are working with a ocean technology company to make it a reality .\nIn an interview with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that such a search for CNEOS 2014-01-08 could offer us \u201c the opportunity to actually put our hands on the relic and figure out whether it \u2019 s natural , whether it \u2019 s a rock , or whether , you know , a small fraction of those [ interstellar objects ] might be artificial.\n\u201d Could It Really Be Made Aliens ?\nIn the past few years , Loeb has talked openly about the possibility that interstellar objects like \u2018 Oumuamua could be artificial objects made by aliens .\nAs the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his main research goals is to look for signs of intelligent life in the Universe .\nAccording to Loeb , who works as chair of astronomy at Harvard , \u2018 Oumuamua had too many bizarre properties to be natural .\nLoeb is convinced that \u2018 Oumuamua is an extraterrestrial spacecraft , and he says that if we want to get a good look at the next one , we need to take this possibility seriously .\n\u2018 Oumuamua mysteriously remained hidden until it was already leaving the solar system .\nTherefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures of it .\nAstronomers are fully aware that it is not a conventional space rock , however .\nAccording to our best calculations , \u2018 Oumuamua is cigar-shaped and 100 meters long .\nAs Loeb properly points out , we \u2019 ve never seen a natural object that looks anything like that .\nAdditionally , \u2018 Oumuamua is about ten times more reflective than ordinary asteroids or comets .\nThat might indicate it has a shiny metal surface .\nThe force that drove \u2018 Oumuamua away from the Sun is what Loeb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to Loeb , it \u2019 s possible that \u2018 Oumuamua was actually a solar sail device that accelerated relative to its closeness to the Sun .\nWriting in the Scientific American journal on June 22 , 2021 , he said : Nevertheless , Loeb is not going so far as to suggest that CNEOS 2014-01-08 could actually be an artifact from extraterrestrial life .\n\u201c This result does not imply that the first interstellar meteor was artificially made by a technological civilization and not natural in origin , \u201d he and Siraj @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expedition .\nEven if this interstellar object is only a rock , it will teach us a lot about the makeup of rocky matter that

days , which is the equivalent of three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Remarkably , we show that embryonic stem cells generate whole synthetic embryos , meaning this includes the placenta and yolk sac surrounding the embryo , \u201d said Professor Jacob Hanna , who led the research .\n\u201c We are truly excited about this work and its implications.\n\u201d The team \u2019 s remarkable work , a world-first has been published in peer-reviewed journal Cell on August 1 , 2022 .\nHowever , the research also raises serious ethical questions which leave many people uncomfortable .\nHave we stopped to contemplate boundaries as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become more successful , enabling scientists to create human organs and even embryos from stem cells ?\nThe International Society for Stem Cell Research ( ISSCR ) released new guidelines last year limiting the culture of human embryos in the laboratory to 14 days , before the first indications of the nervous system start showing , in an effort to address this question .\nAfter 14 days , the embryos must then be destroyed .\nDr. James Briscoe , a principal group leader at the Francis Crick Institute in London , said it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work before human synthetic embryos were developed .\n\u201c Synthetic human embryos are not an immediate prospect .\nWe know less about human embryos than mouse embryos and the inefficiency of the mouse synthetic embryos suggests that translating the findings to human requires further development , \u201d Briscoe said .\n\u201c Now is a good time to consider the best legal and ethical framework to regulate research and use of human synthetic embryos and to update the current regulations , \u201d he added .\nHuman embryos are already subject to regulation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept .\nOne day , could a person \u2019 s womb be used to implant a synthetic human embryo ?\nAccording to researchers at the Weizmann Institute , synthetic mouse embryos can not be regarded as being the same as natural mouse embryos , and so far all attempts to implant them into the womb of a mouse did not result in a pregnancy .\nThe Weizmann Institute experts believe the results of the experiment could hold the key to understanding how organs develop in the embryos and eventually creating replacement organs for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create the best synthetic embryo from human and mouse stem cells is underway .\nThe same team reported last year how they had created an artificial womb that allowed natural mouse embryos to develop outside the uterus for a few days .\nIn the latest research , the same apparatus was used to grow mouse stem cells for more than a week\u2014nearly half the duration of a mouse \u2019 s gestation .\nProfessor Paul Tesar , a geneticist at Case Western Reserve University , said in an interview with StatNews that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further down the course of development , the more the synthetic and natural embryos increasingly converge .\n\u201c There will always be a grey area , \u201d Tesar said .\n\u201c But as scientists and as a society we need to come together to decide where the line is and define what is ethically acceptable.\n\u201d The scientists from the Weizmann Institute claimed their experiment \u2019 s only goal was to prove whether it could one day be feasible to develop synthetic embryos able to grow replacement organs for those in need of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making pregnancy outside the uterus , whether it \u2019 s mice or any species , \u201d lead researcher Dr. Jacob Hanna told the Washington Post .\n\u201c We are really facing difficulties making organs\u2014and in order to make stem cells become organs , we need to learn how the embryo does that .\nWe started with this because the uterus is a black box\u2014it is

our solar system was \u2018 Oumuamua in 2017 , which was then followed by Borisov in 2018 .\nWhile Borisov clearly behaved like a comet , \u2018 Oumuamua was so bizarre that many astronomers thought it could be an alien spaceship .\nHowever , a few years before \u2018 Oumuamua was discovered , scientists thought they had detected an interstellar object that smashed into the Earth in 2014 .\nThe probable interstellar object , known as CNEOS 2014-01-08 , is thought to have been roughly half a meter in width .\nHarvard professor Avi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first to identify the object \u2019 s potential interstellar origins .\nNow , Loeb and Siraj have organized a team of scientists to retrieve the mysterious object from the bottom of the ocean off the coast of Papua New Guinea .\nUsing data from a catalog about the object \u2019 s path , Siraj and Loeb came to the conclusion that it might not be from our Solar System .\nThis is because the object had an unusually high heliocentric velocity , which means it was moving at speeds that indicate it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s gravity well .\nHaving said that , there is a catch .\nThe data utilized to measure the object \u2019 s impact with Earth came from a spy satellite that was operated by the U.S. Department of Defense , designed to monitor military activity on Earth .\nAs a consequence of this , the particular error values of the measurement are a closely guarded secret .\nAdditionally , the U.S. military is cautious about allowing the specific capabilities of their secret spy satellite to become publicly available information .\nBecause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community remain reluctant to formally designate CNEOS 2014-01-08 as an interstellar object in the absence of such information .\nAs a result , Siraj and Loeb \u2019 s paper is still unpublished because it hasn \u2019 t gone through peer review .\nThen on April 22 , 2022 , U.S. Space Force \u2019 s Space Operations Command Chief Scientist , Joel Mozer , examined the relevant classified material and strengthened their argument when he \u201c confirmed that the velocity estimate reported to NASA is sufficiently accurate to indicate an interstellar trajectory.\n\u201d Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it tumbled through Earth \u2019 s atmosphere , likely leaving behind only small pieces that are spread out across the bottom of the ocean just off the coast of Papua New Guinea .\nHowever , the pieces are likely to be magnetic , so a ship searching the ocean floor with a big magnet could potentially pick up the tiny pieces of interstellar object .\nSiraj and Loeb want to do this , so they are working with a ocean technology company to make it a reality .\nIn an interview with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that such a search for CNEOS 2014-01-08 could offer us \u201c the opportunity to actually put our hands on the relic and figure out whether it \u2019 s natural , whether it \u2019 s a rock , or whether , you know , a small fraction of those [ interstellar objects ] might be artificial.\n\u201d Could It Really Be Made Aliens ?\nIn the past few years , Loeb has talked openly about the possibility that interstellar objects like \u2018 Oumuamua could be artificial objects made by aliens .\nAs the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his main research goals is to look for signs of intelligent life in the Universe .\nAccording to Loeb , who works as chair of astronomy at Harvard , \u2018 Oumuamua had too many bizarre properties to be natural .\nLoeb is convinced that \u2018 Oumuamua is an extraterrestrial spacecraft , and he says that if we want to get a good look at the next one , we need to take this possibility seriously .\n\u2018 Oumuamua mysteriously remained hidden until it was already leaving the solar system .\nTherefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures of it .\nAstronomers are fully aware that it is not a conventional space rock , however .\nAccording to our best calculations , \u2018 Oumuamua is cigar-shaped and 100 meters long .\nAs Loeb properly points out , we \u2019 ve never seen a natural object that looks anything like that .\nAdditionally , \u2018 Oumuamua is about ten times more reflective than ordinary asteroids or comets .\nThat might indicate it has a shiny metal surface .\nThe force that drove \u2018 Oumuamua away from the Sun is what Loeb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to Loeb , it \u2019 s possible that \u2018 Oumuamua was actually a solar sail device that accelerated relative to its closeness to the Sun .\nWriting in the Scientific American journal on June 22 , 2021 , he said : Nevertheless , Loeb is not going so far as to suggest that CNEOS 2014-01-08 could actually be an artifact from extraterrestrial life .\n\u201c This result does not imply that the first interstellar meteor was artificially made by a technological civilization and not natural in origin , \u201d he and Siraj @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expedition .\nEven if this interstellar object is only a rock , it will teach us a lot about the makeup of rocky matter that

at the moment amid the ongoing risk of earthquakes and wildfires .\nHowever in a new study , UCLA scientists warn that another more serious catastrophe\u2014dubbed a \u2018 megaflood \u2019 \u2014is on the horizon for California .\nAccording to an alarming study published on Friday ( August 12 ) in the peer-reviewed journal Science Advances , climate change is dramatically increasing the likelihood of a megaflood across the state of California in the future , which would likely result in multiple cities under water and millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a severe storm lasting for an entire month could bring feet of rain to hundreds of miles of California\u2014with some areas receiving more than 100 inches of rain .\nThe loop below , which displays the movement of water vapor and the probable buildup of precipitation at selected time slices during the course of the 30-day scenario , was developed by Xingying Huang , one of the authors of the study .\nThe inevitable disaster is being referred to as California \u2019 s \u201c second Big One \u201d \u2014a reference to the catastrophic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day now\u2014but this new analysis found that the losses caused by a megaflood would outweigh those caused by the major earthquake \u201c by a wide margin.\n\u201d According to the findings of the study , the likelihood of a future megaflood as well as their severity are both significantly increased with each degree of heat caused by global warming .\nIn fact , the scientists concluded that such catastrophic floods are now twice as likely to occur .\nDr. Daniel Swain , a climate scientist at UCLA and co-author of the study , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a future scenario where a megaflood occurs on a hotter planet Earth , \u201c the storm sequence is bigger in almost every respect.\n\u201d \u201c There \u2019 s more rain overall , more intense rainfall on an hourly basis and stronger wind , \u201d Swain added .\nAccording to Swain , statewide floods affecting all of

underestimated .\n\u201c Societally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adaptation infrastructure building perspective we are falling behind , \u201d warned Dr. Swain .\n\u201c Our goal in doing this work is to get ahead of the curve as much as we can when it comes to the risk of megaflood , \u201d he said .\nThe Great Flood of 1862 in California happened before global warming was a thing , measuring up to 300 miles long and 60 miles across .\nHowever , the same storm in 2022 would\u2014according to the study\u2014uproot 5\u201310 million people , cut off the state \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repercussions , and submerge a significant number of major Central Valley cities , in addition to portions of Los Angeles .\nThe research is an expansion of the \u201c ArkStorm scenario \u201d that was published in 2010 , which got its name from the atmospheric rivers that would fuel the severe storm , resulting in mass flooding of biblical proportions .\nThis new study is only the first stage of an initiative referred to as ArkStorm 2.0 , which aims to revisit that scenario further .\nAccording to the research conducted at UCLA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the one that occurred in 1862 would result in a loss of at least one trillion dollars .\n\u201c Parts of cities such as Sacramento , Stockton , Fresno and Los Angeles would be under water even with today \u2019 s extensive collection of reservoirs , levees and bypasses .\nIt is estimated that it would be a $ 1 trillion disaster , larger than any in world history , \u201d the news release said .\nSwain noted in the release that many Californians have forgotten about the severe flooding threat because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the drought and the wildfires .\n\u201c There is potential for bad wildfires every year in California , but a lot of years go by when there \u2019 s no major flood news .\nPeople forget about it , \u201d Swain explained .\nThe scientists used both new high-resolution weather models and existing climate models to compare two extreme situations : one that would occur approximately once every century in the recent historical climate , and another that would occur in the projected climate of 2081-2100 .\nBoth scenarios were analyzed using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these scenarios featured a serious of storms that were fed by atmospheric rivers over the period of one month .\nRibbons of water vapor make up atmospheric rivers , which can be found stretching across thousands of miles from the tropics to the western United States .\nThey are responsible for providing the fuel for the enormous rain and snowstorms that can bring floods throughout the West Coast .\nTheir width ranges from 250 to 375 miles .\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) , these kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ havoc on transportation , bring about lethal mudslides , and cause devastating damage to both life and property .\nNumerous studies now suggest the effects of climate change will cause atmospheric rivers to become hotter , more powerful , and more frequent .\n\u201c Nobody could possibly argue we didn \u2019 t see this coming if and when it hits , \u201d Swain said .\n\u201c There \u2019 s still

and will be published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society journal , was just accepted for publication showing how the stuff that exists between galaxies is pushing back on the sides of the black hole jet .\nA similar effect may be seen in jet engines , and this process is analogous to that effect .\nThe pressure in the surrounding environment causes the exhaust plume to be

kinds of damage to our communications .\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) estimates that the sunspot has a risk of erupting into an X-class flare with a probability of around five percent .\nIf it happens , the flare has the potential to set off a huge geomagnetic storm in the atmosphere of the Earth , which may potentially cause damage to electromagnetic communication networks and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sunspots are darker regions on the surface of the sun that are located where the coronal magnetic fields are especially strong .\nWhen these powerful

by the greatest and most intense X-class flare to ever strike Earth in recent times .\nThis event also caused sparking and even fires in some telegraph stations .\nIt is hypothesized that if a storm

further his long-held aim to change the payments sector .\n\u201c He \u2019 s been trying to disintermediate ACH his whole career , \u201d she said .\nMusk \u2019 s Twitter move is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Libra , an initiative that aimed to provide cryptocurrency wallets to Facebook \u2019 s more than 1 billion users .\nThe proposal collapsed under the intense scrutiny of Congress , but according to Long , Twitter can thrive where Facebook failed since its payment foundation is the Bitcoin Lightning network , a largely decentralized system that doesn \u2019 t \u201c have the same political baggage \u201d as a project overseen by Mark Zuckerberg .\nLooking at the individuals Musk has hired to assist him succeed with his Twitter acquisition provides more indication that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zhao , creator of Binance ; David Sacks , another member of PayPal syndicate who is extensively interested in crypto ; and Sriram Krishnan , an investor for a16z Crypto and the owner of an Ethereum address under his Twitter account , are all prominent figures in the cryptocurrency industry , according to Fortune .\nMusk \u2019 s previous statements are more evidence that he intends to utilize his new acquisition as a means of settlement .\nMusk has forecast $ 1.2 billion in payment income for Twitter by 2028 , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Times .\nThis would allow him to fulfill his stated objective of making the company less reliant on advertisements .\nIn 1999 , while Musk was at the helm of PayPal , the firm was poised to disrupt the payments industry thanks to a combination of technology innovation ( the internet ) and a risk-taking management team .\nAs we examine the Twitter purchase a little closer , it is obvious that he has the same ambitions .\nMusk is a businessman after all .\nMusk has already somewhat freed the Twitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with people now reaching more of their own followers than they used to .\nIt seems that as far as community standards go , that

"content": "Homo Floresiensis is the name given to a tiny but somewhat complete skeleton discovered on the Indonesian island of Flores in 2003 by archaeologists hunting for proof of the migration of modern humans from Asia to Australia .\nIn popular culture , it was dubbed \u201c The Hobbit , \u201d after the breakfast-loving little people of J.R.R .\nTolkien \u2019 s The Hobbit .\nFurther investigation moved the estimated survival time of the species back to roughly 50,000 years from the previous estimate of around 12,000 years .\nNonetheless , a retired anthropology professor from the University of Alberta claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the species is still around and that , or at least within recent history .\nGregory Forth , author of the soon-to-be-released book Between Ape and Human , writes an opinion article for The Scientist in which he claims palaeontologists as well as other researchers have ignored Indigenous knowledge and reports of a \u201c ape-man \u201d dwelling in the jungles of Flores .\n\u201c My aim in writing the book was to find the best explanation \u2014 that is , the most rational and empirically best supported \u2014 of Lio accounts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece .\n\u201c These include reports of sightings by more than 30 eyewitnesses , all of whom I spoke with directly .\nAnd I conclude that the best way to explain what they told me is that a non-sapiens hominin has survived on Flores to the present or very recent times.\n\u201d According to his account , the Lio people who live on the island have a folk zoology that includes legends about humans changing into animals when they migrate to and adjust to new settings , which he compares to Lamarckism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c As my fieldwork revealed , such posited changes reflect local observations of similarities and differences between a supposed ancestral species and its differentiated descendants , \u201d he says .\nSince they lack the advanced language and technology of humanity , the Lio just label these beings as animals .\nHowever , others have noticed their uncanny resemblance to humans .\n\u201c For the Lio , the ape-man \u2019 s appearance as something incompletely human makes the creature anomalous and hence problematic and disturbing , \u201d Forth continued .\nH. floresiensis \u2019 last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50,000 years in the past .\nHowever , Forth stresses the need of including Indigenous knowledge into studies of hominid evolutionary origin .\n\u201c Our initial instinct , I suspect , is to regard the extant ape-men of Flores as completely imaginary .\nBut , taking seriously what Lio people say , I \u2019 ve found no good reason to think so , \u201d he concludes .\n\u201c What they say about the creatures , supplemented by other sorts of evidence , is fully consistent with a surviving hominin species , or one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 years.\n\u201d So , what do you think ?\nIs the Hobbit-man still out there ?\nIt \u2019 s possible..",

bulletproof vest and was wearing a pair of Gucci loafers .\nIn addition to the firearms , knives , cash , and night vision goggles , he also carried a duffel bag with millions of dollars \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illegal substances would be included in this tale .\nThe now-famous 175-pound black bear was found dead in the Chattahoochee National Forest three months after the incident , when authorities followed the flightpath of Thornton \u2019 s jet .\nAfter discovering many empty packages around the animal , they determined that it had consumed one of 10 duffel bags carrying the illegal substance .\nIt had obviously overdosed after consuming 70 pounds of cocaine .\nIt sounds like the bear had a genuinely horrible and rather rapid death , in contrast to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a violent rampage .\n\u201c Its stomach was literally packed to the brim with cocaine .\nThere isn \u2019 t a mammal on the planet that could survive that .\nCerebral haemorrhaging , respiratory failure , hyperthermia

the bear , now affectionately known as \u201c Pablo Eskobear , \u201d does not stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is on display at the Kentucky For Kentucky shop in Lexington .\nA film adaptation of this epic

\u201d and they have seized social media by storm .\nTheir virality has evolved in tandem with that of ChatGPT , OpenAI \u2019 s next-generation Artificial intelligence program chat-bot .\nIt has been

most prominent examples of which are OpenAI \u2019 s DALL-E and Midjourney \u2019 s Stable Diffusion , have caused a disruption in the creative industry .\nFuturism reports that a recording company

conversations with living celebrities and.. dead ones .\nYou can say AI has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lest we forget , that Google engineer who was recently suspended after going public that he was totally convinced they have made a chat bot called LaMDA that was sentient .\nExperts have been working on the underlying technology for years , but recent advances , coupled with significant financial investment , have sparked a mad rush to market .\nThis has led to a proliferation of consumer goods that include cutting-edge technologies .\nThe only catch is that neither the goods nor the consumers are prepared .\nExample : those \u201c Magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem dangerous at first glance .\nAfter all , and there is nothing wrong with letting the software transform you into a colorful avatar..\nIn contrast to text-to-image converters , you \u2019 re restricted to the confines of the images you currently own .\nArtists began raising concerns as soon as the \u201c avatars \u201d became viral , pointing out that Lensa provided no safeguards for the artists whose work may have been utilized to train the computer .\nOn a negative note , despite Lensa \u2019 s \u201c zero nakedness \u201d usage

least , anyone you have a handful of photos of ) , is terrifying , \u201d writes Haje Jan Kamps in Techcrunch .\nKamps evaluated the app \u2019 s pornographic creation capabilities by giving it badly altered photographs of celebrity faces superimposed on naked individuals .\nUnfortunately for him , the manipulated photographs easily bypassed all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c Adding NSFW content into the mix , and we are careening into some pretty murky territory very quickly : your friends or some random person you met in a bar and exchanged Facebook friend status with may not have given consent to someone generating soft-core porn of them , \u201d he said .\nHorrible stuff , but it gets far worse than that .\nDespite Lensa \u2019 s claims to prevent users from creating child pornography , journalist Olivia Snow found this awful possibility after uploading photographs of herself as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Magic Avatars \u201d feature .\n\u201c I managed to piece together the minimum 10 photos required to run the app and waited to see how it transformed me from awkward six-year-old to fairy princess , \u201d she wrote in Wired .\n\u201c The results were horrifying.\n\u201d \u201c What resulted were fully-nude photos of an adolescent and sometimes childlike face but a distinctly adult body , \u201d she continued .\n\u201c This set produced a kind of coyness : a bare back , tousled hair , an avatar with my childlike face holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s breasts.\n\u201d The stories told by Kamps and Snow both highlight an aggravating fact about today \u2019 s AI technology : it often acts in ways its designers didn \u2019 t anticipate and can even circumvent the safeguards that were put in place to prevent this .\nIt suggests the AI business is moving ahead of the pace at which society and even their own technology can keep up .\nThis is really concerning , especially in light of these findings .\nLensa said in a statement to Techcrunch that users are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the app .\nThis opinion is shared by many in the business world : bad actors will always exist , and they will continue to be terrible actors .\nAnother prevalent argument is that a competent user of Photoshop could make anything produced by such applications just as easily .\nThey argue that any explicit or pornographic images are \u201c the result of intentional misconduct on the app.\n\u201d These two points of view are not completely without merit .\nNeither of these things , however , alters the reality that Lensa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its like , renders it much simpler for evil actors to achieve what they could otherwise do .\nFor the first time , anybody with access to the correct algorithm may generate convincing fake nudes or high-quality renderings of child sexual abuse material .\nThe opening of Pandora \u2019 s box metaphor is also apparent .\nThe Lensas of the world may try to patent their technology all they want , but copycat algorithms that circumvent the protections will still be developed .\nIt will happen .\nIt is a certainty .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been a rising awareness of the potential for actual individuals to face real and severe damage from the premature adoption of AI technologies , including picture generators .\nMeanwhile , the sector seems to be embracing a full steam ahead stance , with a focus on racing rivals to get venture capital investment rather than ensuring the tools are adequately secure .\nKeep in mind that nonconsensual porn is just one of many potential dangers here .\nAnother key worry is the ease with which political disinformation might be produced .\nAlso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nTeachers are scared out of their wits at this possibility .\nWhile AI may make our lives easier , it is undoubtedly going to create many issues going forward .\nWhere does it end when soon it will be entirely possible to fake an entire speech from a politician ?\nWhile it \u2019 s cool we will probably be able to bring dead actors back from the dead for the big screen , will you be able to trust literally anything digitally that you see anymore without it being directly in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nEven an apparently harmless tool like
