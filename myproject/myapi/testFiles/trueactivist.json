years and years , people haven \u2019 t thought to look for another option , until more recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s probably not the best idea to throw salt all over the sidewalks and streets without considering the implications it has on the environment .\nMost people know that when plants are exposed to too much salt , they usually die , which is why throwing salt all over the place leaves the ground and the soil unfit for plant growth as well .\nAnd in that same light , houses and other types of structures that are situated by the sea suffer corrosion and metal rusting due to the salt water spray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not survive in the oceans .\nBecause of this , areas such as D.C. and Winnipeg , as well as Michigan , have begun looking into using vegetable alternatives to salt as explained by one study after finding \u201c major changes in the Great Lakes ecosystem.\n\u201d Winnipeg communications officer Ken Allen explained , \u201c The benefit from using beet-based melting products is that it reduces the chloride loading on infrastructure and the environment , while producing a good quality melting solution.\n\u201d It has been found that when ice-melting chlorides are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more effective at reducing ice buildup than salt .\nBut apparently beets aren \u2019 t the only type of food products that are being used in North America .\nAccording to a report from Bloomberg , cheese brine , pickle-juice , and even leftover beer have been used by a number of transportation departments that are looking to lessen the major budget amounts normally given to the purchasing of salt .\nThe reason why salt works to melt the ice is because the chemical changes created by salt in water requires a lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level .\nAnd when beet extract is combined with 20 % chloride , the temperature drops even more , which means that any residual water will turn into ice overnight when the temperatures are truly frigid .\nAlmost 15 to 17 million tons of rock salt is used to place on U.S. roadways every single year , which sadly contaminates drinking water and waterways .\nIt also leads to the corrosion of plowing equipment , which leads to more deer collisions since they come out to the roads to lick the salt .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ State actually \u2018 accounts for 40 % of the state \u2019 s DoT budget.\n\u2019 Meanwhile , states such as Illinois rely on their education system to reduce the contamination that comes from over-salting .\nAs explained on Michigan Radio by stream ecologist and director of Illinois RiverWatch , Danelle Haake , \u201c I often see a cup worth of salt on a single sidewalk square , but one cup of salt should be enough to do an entire driveway\u2026 depending on your driveway.\n\u201d Her suggestion is to dissolve less salt in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice .\nShe also explained that the road salt hazards aren \u2019 t limited to just freshwater ecosystems .\nSodium chloride has the tendency to degrade bridges , roadways , and even damage trucks and cars , while affecting human health at the same time .\nAs explained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , a high-salt diet contributes to high blood pressure , heart disease , and strokes .\nThis also means that those that live near roadways where road salt is used have an increased risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water .\nHaake shared , \u201c If you \u2019 re drinking tap water with a lot of salt , it \u2019 s like eating salty fries all day long.\n\u201d The hope is that more transportation departments follow suit and begin using safer , vegetable-based de-icers in

the U.S. Department of Energy \u2019 s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and Stanford University have joined together to find a way to revive rechargeable lithium batteries .\nWhat this could mean is to possibly boost the range of battery life for the next generation of electric vehicles and electronic devices .\nWhen it comes to the lifecycle of lithium batteries , they eventually accumulate little islands of inactive lithium that end up being cut off from the electrodes , which eventually decreases the capacity of the battery \u2019 s overall store charge .\nWhat the research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make these \u201c dead \u201d lithium slowly move towards the other electrodes , much like a worm inching it \u2019 s way over , until it manages to reconnect , allowing it to partially reserve the parts that have , in essence , \u201c died.\n\u201d By doing this , they managed to slow down the degradation of the test battery , which managed to increase the lifetime by almost 30 % .\nPublished in Nature journal last December 22 , the lead author of the study , Stanford postdoctoral fellow Fang Liu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploring the potential recovery of lost capacity in lithium-ion batteries using an extremely fast discharging step.\n\u201d There is a lot of ongoing research that \u2019 s looking for new and innovative ways to develop rechargeable batteries with certain characteristics like longer lifetimes , lighter weight , faster charging speeds than the lithium-ion technology used in smartphones , laptops , and electric vehicles , and improved safety as well .\nOne main focus has been on developing lithium-metal batteries that could store more energy per volume or weight .\nOne example of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these so-called next-gen batteries could possibly increase the EV \u2019 s mileage per charge , while also taking up less trunk space .\nFor both lithium-ion and lithium-metal batteries , they use positively charged lithium ions that travel back and forth between the electrodes .\nAs time goes on , some of the metallic lithium becomes electrochemically inactive , which end up forming \u2018 isolated islands of lithium \u2019 that don \u2019 t connect with the electrodes .\nAs a result , there is also a loss of capacity of the battery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it comes to lithium-metal technology , as well as for all the other fast charging lithium-ion batteries on the market .\nBut in this new study , the research group showed how they managed to mobilize and recover these isolated lithium islands in order to extend the battery life .\nProfessor at Stanford and SLAC and investigator with the Stanford Institute for Materials and Energy Research ( SIMES ) , Yi Cui , who happened to lead the research , shared , \u201c I always thought of isolated lithium as bad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even catch on fire .\nBut we have discovered how to electrically reconnect this \u2018 dead \u2019 lithium with the negative electrode to reactivate it.\n\u201d As explained by Prof. Cui , he believes that \u2018 applying a voltage to a battery \u2019 s cathode and anode could make an isolated island of lithium physically move between the electrodes \u2013 a process his team has now confirmed with their experiments.\n\u2019 The scientists invented an optical cell with a lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxide ( NMC ) cathode , a lithium anode , and an isolated lithium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ device let them track what happens inside a battery when it \u2019 s being used in real time .\nWhat they found was that the isolated lithium island wasn \u2019 t actually \u201c dead , \u201d but still responded to the operations of the battery .\nWhen they charged the cell , the island was seen slowly moving towards the cathode , while during discharge , it would creep in the opposite direction .\nProf. Cui explained , \u201c It \u2019 s like a very slow worm that inches its head forward and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by nanometer .\nIn this case , it transport by dissolving away on end and depositing material to the other end .\nIf we can keep the lithium worm moving , it will eventually touch the anode and reestablish the electrical connection.\n\u201d After getting the results , the research group managed to validate the outcome with other test batteries , as well as through computer simulations , to demonstrate how the isolated lithium could be recovered in a real battery just by changing the charging protocols of the battery .\nLiu chimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we can move the detached lithium toward the anode during discharging , and these motions are faster under higher currents .\nSo we added a fast , high-current discharging step right after the battery charges , which moved the isolated lithium far enough to reconnect it with the anode .\nThis reactivates the lithium so it can participate in the life of the battery.\n\u201d In conclusion , Liu said , \u201c Our findings also have wide implications for the design and development of more robust lithium-metal batteries.\n\u201d What are your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this news !", "author": "True Activist", "url":

survive : water and oxygen .\nWith the big leap in modern technology , researchers are beginning to discover that earth may not be alone when it comes to being the home of oxygen and water .\nAside from signs of water in Mars , they \u2019 re discovering that the moon may also contain oxygen .\nThis has come as such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was impossible .\nThere could never be oxygen on the moon .\nOr , is it possible ?\nResearchers have invested much of their time and money to invest in technologies that allow productive and effective space-resource utilization .\nTheir hard work focused on identifying the best technique to be able to manufacture oxygen on the Moon .\nLast October , the Australian Space Agency and NASA came into an agreement .\nThe wanted to send an Australian-built rover to the Moon .\nThis was going to be a part of what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon has an absence of atmosphere , it is thin and largely made up of hydrogen , neon , and argon .\nThe mix of gases are unable to support oxygen-dependent mammals such as man .\nIronically , the Moon also has plenty of oxygen .\nIt must be stressed that this is just not a gas .\nThe precious oxygen is locked in regolith , the Moon \u2019 s surface layer that \u2019 s covered in rock and fine dust .\nIs it possible to extract oxygen from regolith to support life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minerals found on the earth that contain oxygen .\nAnd in reality , the moon generally made up of Earth \u2019 s rocks .\nThe difference is that its surface has a slightly greater amount of material that come from meteors in outer space .\nSuch materials are silica , aluminum , iron , and magnesium oxides , and these are found to be abundant on the moon .\nOur lungs just can \u2019 t access these .\nOn the Moon , these minerals come in the form of hard rock , dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millennia , meteorites that crash on its surface have made this quite plentiful in the area .\nThere are also those that refer to the moon \u2019 s surface layer as \u201c soil.\n\u201d This term is a unique and miraculous substance found just on Earth .\nOver millions of years , a presence of millions of species have managed to contribute on the soil \u2019 s primary material , which is called regolith or hard rock .\nThe end product of all the work is a mineral matrix not present in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chemical , and biological properties .\nAnd on the moon \u2019 s surface , this is mostly unchanged or unevolved regolith .\nThe regolith that \u2019 s present on the Moon contains about 45 percent oxygen .\nHowever , that is locked up underneath all those minerals .\nEnergy must be applied in order to unshackle those tight relationships .\nThis isn \u2019 t impossible because breaking relationships of minerals has already been done .\nIn fact , this is the method used to create aluminum .\nIn order to separate aluminum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducted through a liquid form of aluminum oxide .\nThe liquid form is referred to as alumina .\nOxygen becomes a byproduct in the process .\nOn the said celestial body , the oxygen is its main product , and the aluminum and other metals present will be a byproduct .\nWhile the process may sound complicated , it \u2019 s actually quite simple .\nThe only issue is that it \u2019 s somewhat energy intensive .\nThe work It would need to be powered by solar energy or other lunar resources to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extract oxygen from regolith , heavy industrial equipment is a requirement .\nThat \u2019 s because they need to melt solid metal oxide with solvents or electrolytes .\nFor now , this is possible .\nThe challenge would be to get to the Moon and make it run .\nSpace Applications Services , a Belgian business , stated earlier that they were in the process of developing three experimental electrolysis reactors .\nTheir ultimate goal is to send it to the Moon by 2025 as part of the European Space Agency \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success , they have assumed that the moon will be able to supply a good amount of oxygen .\nThey have estimated that the amount of oxygen found on its regolith , considering that they don \u2019 t even count the amount if they dig deeper into hard rock materials .\nLunar regolith contains around 1.4 tons of minerals .\nIncluded here are 630 kilos of oxygen per cubic meter .\nNASA has made an estimation , and they say that man needs around 800 grams of oxygen each day in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can hold for two years or even slightly more .\nIf they had to make an assumption that the regolith on the moon is 10 meters deep , they will be able to extract all the oxygen available .\nSimply put , the first ten meters of its surface will be able to support all 8 billion people on this planet for a long 100,000 years if so desired .\nThe numbers will also depend on how they will extract and utilize oxygen .\nNonetheless , the numbers have been very impressive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is good news , the plant contains materials that are still very precious .\nThese should not be squandered and wasted .\nThis is still the only planet that can sustain all terrestrial life without making use of special machineries and processes .\nWhat are

amazing bird tweets that everyone finds so musical are more than just a melodious tune .\nIn fact , a new study has found that male song sparrows can deliberately mix and shuffle their song repertoire , precisely to keep their female counterparts interested .\nThe study research , conducted in the lab of Duke University professor of biology and member of the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences , Stephen Nowicki , and his colleagues from the University of Miami , found that the singing male sparrows actually keep track of their songs , the order in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how often they sing the same one , for up to 30 minutes .\nAnd this is possibly so that they plan out what they sing at the moment , as well as what they plan to sing afterwards .\nWhile song sparrows are one of the most common songbirds all throughout North America , it \u2019 s only the males that can actually sing .\nNot only do they sing to court females , but they also use their \u201c voices \u201d to defend their territories .\nIncredibly , when a song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sing up to 12 different two-second songs , which can take almost 30 minutes to get through since they tend to repeat the same song over and over again before they move on to their next anthem .\nPlus , aside from changing up their number of song repeats , these male sparrows also shift the order of their songs every time they sing , but one thing that \u2019 s still not necessarily known is if these male birds change their song order and repeat them by accident , or if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand if birds are intentionally mixing and shuffling their tunes , the Maytag Professor of Ornithology in Biology at the University of Miami , William Searcy , who is Nowicki \u2019 s long-time collaborator , decided to head outdoors to the backwoods of northwest Pennsylvania with loads of recording gear , and set up microphones which they point towards to trees to record the birds , sometimes waiting for up to five hours a day .\nNowicki explains that this type of fieldwork isn \u2019 t always for everyone .\nHe shares , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boring , because it \u2019 s relaxing if you like being out in the field and it \u2019 s a nice day and you \u2019 ve got your parabolic microphone and you \u2019 re pointing it at a song sparrow for hours .\nSome people would find that boring .\nI and certainly Bill would find that meditatively relaxing .\nThe only thing that happens is sometimes your arm gets tired.\n\u201d The team spent hours in the woods , but managed to record the full suite of songs from over 30 birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searched through all the visual spectrographs of the trills in order to analyze how often each and every song was sung , as well as the order of which they were tweeted .\nOne of their first clues that males are very much aware of their songs and avoid reputation , just how your favorite Spotify playlist does , is that the \u2018 males generally sing through their full repertoire before repeating a song.\n\u2019 The group also discovered that the more one of the male birds sang a particular song , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that song , which they believe could probably be so they could \u2018 build up hype and novelty once that song was played again.\n\u2019 They further explained , if a male bird sang \u201c Song A \u201d for at least 10 times in a row , he would sing even more variations of this other songs first before going back to Song A .\nMoreover , if Song A was sung at least 10 times in a row , he would sing more renditions of this other songs before choosing to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But on the other hand , if Song A was only sung three times during the birds \u201c first set , \u201d then he may just \u2018 recite a shorter rendition of the rest of his repertoire in order to return to the still novel and underplayed Song A.\n\u2019 When all these findings were taken into consideration , they proved that song sparrows have an incredibly rare talent that is actually known as \u201c long-distance dependencies.\n\u201d What this means is that what a male song sparrow may have sung at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , possibly over 30 minutes before that .\nThis proves that these birds have a \u2018 360 times larger memory capacity than the previous record holder , \u2019 which was the canary , who reportedly can only handle around five seconds worth of song information in the same way as the sparrow .\nAlthough this is quite impressive , the implications from this work , when it comes to humans , is not as clear .\nBut what it does show is that just like the order of words in human language , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependencies as well , is not as exclusive to humans as once believed .\nAlthough there is still uncertain whether the ability to shuffle things around better does actually give the males a greater advantage at finding a mate , there is a chance that the females to maintain their interest in a male mate with the ability to mix things up more .\nCurrently , Nowicki and team share that their theory is just speculation at the moment , and that these possible song-shuffling song sparrows have yet to prove their theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be said

power people \u2019 s normal , everyday lives , they require energy systems , and these produce wasted heat , such as the heat that comes from exhaust pipes on vehicles and hot water pipes in buildings for example .\nBut according to scientists from Penn State and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory , there is now a new flexible thermoelectric generator that can be wrapped around these pipes and other types of hot surfaces , which can now convert wasted heat into electricity way more efficiently than what was possible before .\nAccording to associate vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science and engineering at Penn State , \u201c A large amount of heat from the energy we consume is essentially being thrown away , often dispersed right into the atmosphere .\nWe haven \u2019 t had cost-effective ways with conformal shapes to trap and convert that heat to useable energy .\nThis research opens that door.\n\u201d The group of researchers from Penn State has been busy working on improving the performance of these thermoelectric generators .\nThese are devices that can convert differences in temperature to electricity , and when they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain that the electrons move from the hot side to the cold side , which produces an electric current .\nThe team had previously created rigid devices that were \u2018 more efficient than commercial units in high-temperature applications.\n\u2019 But now , the team has managed to develop a new type of manufacturing process that can now produce flexible devices that also give higher power output and efficiency .\nAssistant research professor at Penn State , Wenjie Li explains , \u201c These results provide a promising pathway toward widespread utilization of thermoelectric technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have a significant impact on the development of practical thermal to electrical generators.\n\u201d The scientists also explain that these flexible devices are a much better fit than even the current most attractive waste heat sources , such as pipes in the residential and industrial buildings , and those on vehicles .\nMeanwhile , they also don \u2019 t require to be glued onto the surfaces , like how the traditional and more rigid devices to , which in turn decreases their efficiency .\nThe group of scientists shared with Applied Materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas flue , which is the new device that exhibited 150 % higher power density than other state-of-the-art units .\nThey explained that \u2018 a scaled-up version , just over 3-inches squared , maintained a 115 % power density advantage .\nThat version exhibited a total power output of 56.5 watts when placed on the hot surface.\n\u2019 Priya explained , \u201c Think about an industrial power plant with pipe hundreds of feet long .\nIf you can wrap these devices around an area that large , you could generate kilowatts of energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just being thrown away .\nYou could convert discarded heat into something useful.\n\u201d These thermoelectric devices are made up of small couples , which look like a table with two legs .\nAnd many of these \u2018 two-leg couples \u2019 are also connected together , which typically tend to form a flat , square device .\nWith the new device , the scientists put six couples along a thin strip , after which , they used flexible metal foil to connect 12 strips together , which created a device with 72 couples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the layers of each strip to improve their device performance .\nAssociate research professor at Penn State , Bed Poudel , said , \u201c As you scale up these devices , you often lose power density , making it challenging to fabricate large-scale thermoelectric generators .\nThis illustrates the extraordinary performance of our 72-couple device.\n\u201d It was the 72-couple device that showed \u2018 the highest reported output power and device power density form a single thermoelectric generator.\n\u2019 The gaps found between the strips give the flexibility for the device to fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipes .\nThey also allow for more \u2018 flexibility in altering the fill factor , or the ratio between the area of thermoelectric material and the area of the device.\n\u2019 The scientists also explain that this is also what could be used to optimize thermoelectric devices for a variety of heat sources .\nWhat are your thoughts

, as well as vertical farms and gardens producing food , the world is moving forward into what will hopefully one day become an entirely sustainable-working globe .\nIn fact , just recently , ElectReon shared that they have a partnership with the Michigan Department of Transportation in order to create a wireless charging demonstration project that will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recharge EVs while people drive them on that road .\nThis project held in Michigan is hoping to be launched no later than next year , in the city of Detroit , which is the site of Ford \u2019 s central transportation innovation district .\nThis will provide the infrastructure that will wirelessly charge EVs whether they are stationary or moving over that particular stretch of pavement .\nAccording to Gov .\nGretchen Witmer , who explained that this wireless charging project is considered quite an integral part in electrifying vehicle fleets .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ As we aim to lead the future of mobility and electrification by boosting electric vehicle production and lowering consumer costs , a wireless in-road charging system is the next piece to the puzzle for sustainability.\n\u201d In fact , the Michigan project will be funded by the state , who will provide at least $ 1.9 million for the undertaking .\nThis is to be carried out in collaboration with the Ford Automotive Company , DTE \u2013 which is a local energy company that will be the one to provide the necessary connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road , as well as ROUSH CleanTech .\nThis is a company that converts commercial vehicles into EVs which will also provide an electric truck to the project too .\nAs explained by Michigan Central development director , Carolina Pluszczynski , \u201c Hosting the first wireless charging road system in the U.S. as part of the open platform we are providing at Michigan Central will serve as a magnet to attract innovators to test on this nationally significant asset , and also show people the value electrification can create.\n\u201d Notably , ElectReon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israel , also has very similar inaugural projects that have already been operating in Italy , Germany , and Sweden .\nIt is also getting ready to provide a wireless charging network in Israel for at least 200 public buses in the busiest city in the country , Tel Aviv .\nMoreover , ElectReon \u2019 s inductive in-road charging technology was already used in a project in Brescia , Italy , near Milan , known as the \u201c Arena of the Future.\n\u201d ElectReon managed to integrate their wireless

polymerization process , and it \u2019 s as light as plastic and stronger than steel .\nMoreover , it can also be easily manufactured in big quantities .\nThis new material is a two-dimensional polymer that self-assembles into sheets , which is unlike other polymers , that normally form one-dimensional , spaghetti-like chains .\nUntil this new type of polymer was created , scientists thought that it was impossible to induce polymers to create 2D sheets .\nAccording to the Carbon P. Dubbs Professor of Chemical Engineering at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the use of this material is great .\nSome ideas include making a durable , lightweight coating for cellphones or car parts , or possibly building material for bridges and other such structures .\nHe is also the senior author of this new study .\nStrano explains , \u201c We don \u2019 t usually think of plastics as being something that you could use to support a building , but with this material , you can enable new things .\nIt has very unusual properties and we \u2019 re very excited about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research group has already filed for two different patents on the process they used to make the new material .\nAll plastics fall under the term \u201c polymers , \u201d which come of chains of building blocks known as monomers .\nWhen you add new molecules onto their ends , the chains grow .\nOnce they \u2019 re formed , these polymers can be shaped into three-dimensional objects like water bottles by using injection molding .\nScientists that specialize in polymer have long since believed that if they could be \u2018 induced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they would make incredibly strong yet lightweight materials .\nBut years of work in this field led them to conclude that making these sheets was basically impossible .\nOne particular reason for this was that \u2018 if just one monomer rotates up or down , out of the plan of the growing sheet , the material will begin expanding in three dimensions and the sheet-like structure will be lost.\n\u2019 But in this new study Prof Strano and his team managed to come up with a brand new polymerization process which allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is called a polyaramide .\nAs for the monomer building blocks , the scientists use a compound called melamine .\nThis contains a ring of carbon and nitrogen atoms .\nWhen these are placed under the right conditions , the monomers can grow into two dimensions which form disks .\nWhen these disks stack up on top of each other , they are held together by hydrogen bonds between the layers , which is what makes the structure strong and stable .\nStrano goes on to explain , \u201c Instead of making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sheet-like molecular plane , where we get molecules to hook themselves together in two dimensions .\nThis mechanism happens spontaneously in solution , and after we synthesize the material , we can easily spin-coat thin films that are extraordinarily strong.\n\u201d Since the material self-assembles in solution , it can also be produced in big quantities by just increasing the quantity of the starting materials .\nThe research group also showed that they could coat surfaces with films of this new material , which is called 2DPA-1 .\nStrano also said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planar molecules that are going to be much easier to fashion into a very strong , but extremely thin material.\n\u201d Material That is Light But Strong What the researchers have discovered about the new material \u2019 s elastic modulus , which is its measure of \u2018 how much force it takes to deform a material , \u2019 is that it is between four and six time greater than bulletproof glass .\nScientists also found that 2DPA-1 \u2019 s yield strength , which is how much force it takes to break the material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite the fact that the material is only around one-sixth the density of steel .\nIn addition , another vital feature of 2DPA-1 is it \u2019 s impermeable to gases .\nNormally , other polymers are created from coiled chains with gaps , which allow gases to seep through .\nThis new material , however , is made from monomers that lock together just like LEGOs do , which is why molecules can \u2019 t get in between them .\nStrano goes on to say , \u201c This could allow us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water or gases from getting through .\nThis kind of barrier coating could be used to protect metal in cars and other vehicles , or steel structures.\n\u201d Alongside his students , Strano is examining the 2DPA-1 closely to see how this particular type of polymer is able to form 2D sheets , while experimenting with changing its molecular makeup to produce other types of new material .\nYou

glamorous as the job sounds , it \u2019 s actually far from that .\nBeing able to travel to space is no easy feat .\nThis requires hours of training and tons of studying .\nMore importantly , many of the astronauts working for NASA won \u2019 t even see what \u2019 s beyond .\nAs for space travel itself , a lot of thought of planning go into it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ?\nWhat is their diet going to look like ?\nWhat are the safety precautions they need to take ?\nHence , scientists and researchers have looked into animal behavior that may help these space travelers .\nOne creature they \u2019 re studying right now is the wintering squirrel .\nIt \u2019 s a known fact that bears and ground squirrels hibernate during winter .\nThis means that they stop eating until spring comes .\nTheir body \u2019 s nutrients rely simply on the fat reserves they \u2019 ve stored up when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of prolonged fasting and inactivity significantly reduces the mass and function of the human muscle .\nWhen it comes to hibernators , this isn \u2019 t a problem at all .\nHow they do it is a mystery that researchers want to solve .\nAt the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al , a biologist has figured out why .\nThis means that his findings could have implications for future of space travel .\nWhat he did was study a 13-lined ground squirrel that lives abundantly in North America .\nMatthew Regan has confirmed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d and this dates way back to the 1980s .\nThis theorizes that hibernators harness a metabolic trick of their gut microbes so that they are able to recycle the nitrogen that is found in the urea .\nAs for the nitrogen itself , this is a waste compound that is oftentimes excreted by the body as urine .\nHowever , they want to see if this can build new tissue proteins .\nThe question now is , how could this discovery be used in space travel ?\nTheoretically , Regan posits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to minimizing their own muscle-loss problems caused by microgravity-induced suppression of protein synthesis , would they be able to reduce nitrogen production and excretion through intense exercises ?\nThere must be a method that helps augment the astronauts \u2019 muscle protein synthesis processes using urea nitrogen salvage .\nBy doing so , they may be able to achieve better muscle health especially when they are commissioned for long voyages into deep space in a spacecraft that is too small to fit the conventional exercise equipment .\nCan this be done ?\nHe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also doing this via a Canadian Space Agency research grant at UdeM .\nThis was where he took up a position as assistant professor of animal physiology in the Department of Biological Sciences in the last year .\nRegan added , \u201c If there is an overlap between the proteins in spaceflight and the ones from hibernation , then it suggests this process may have benefits to muscle health during spaceflight.\n\u201d In order to pull off the research , Regan designed a series of techniques and experiments to look into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and provide proof for whether or not they occur in the 13-lined ground squirrel during the winter hibernation time .\nIn order to pull the hypothesis off , they worked in the lab where they injected their test squirrels \u2019 blood with \u201c double-labeled \u201d urea .\nThis meant that the urea \u2019 s carbon atom was 13C instead of the usual 12C , and its nitrogen atoms were 15N instead of the usual 14N .\nThey labeled these , which enabled them to track the urea-sourced carbon and nitrogen as it went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nitrogen salvage process .\nThey discovered that the process led from the initial transport of urea from the blood into the gut , to the breakdown of urea into its component parts by gut microbes , to the flow of substances , which is called metabolites , containing urea nitrogen as it went back into the squirrel until the urea nitrogen in tissue protein finally came to be .\n\u201c Essentially , seeing 13C and/or 15N in metabolites at these various steps indicated that they originated from urea , and thus , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d said Regan .\nHe did the study on squirrels with and without gut microbiomes and at three times of the year .\nFirst , he did it during summer when they led active lives and were awake .\nThen he studied them during early winter when they were into fasting and hibernation for more or less a month .\nLastly , he studied them in late winter when they were four months in the fasting and hibernation process .\nThey discovered something definitive , and it was that at each step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence of urea nitrogen salvage as seen by the squirrels with intact gut microbiomes .\nAs for those with depleted gut microbiomes , these squirrels displayed no evidence of urea nitrogen salvage at any time during the process .\nThey were able to say that the process was entirely dependent on the gut microbes \u2019 ability to degrade urea .\nMore importantly , it \u2019 s also good to note that this is something that the squirrels are unable to do on their own .\nRegan and his team also came up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first is that the incorporation of urea nitrogen into the tissue protein of the squirrels was at its peak during late winter .\nThis somehow alludes that the urea nitrogen salvage becomes more active deeper into the hibernation process .\nThis is not similar to most physiological processes during hibernation , when tend to be significantly reduced .\n\u2022 The other finding was that there was evidence the microbes themselves were utilizing the urea nitrogen to build its own set of new proteins .\nThis is most helpful for them because they , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same conditions of fasting hibernation .\nHence , they were able to conclude that , both the squirrel and its microbes benefit from urea nitrogen salvage .\nThis means that the process a symbiosis at its most genuine form .\nRegan said that this meant something .\nHe said that the squirrels emerge from hibernation in the spring maintaining their health .\nThis is also vital because the year \u2019 s only mating season , which is a time of intense physical activity for both the males and females species , happens right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tissue function , specifically the muscle tissue function , is extremely important for them to successfully mate .\nThe Starving Masses and The Elderly Population More than what this means for space travel and for the health of astronauts , Regan \u2019 s discovery also have direct impact on life on Earth , particularly in the underdeveloped countries where most starving people are , and , of course , with the elderly folks .\nMillions upon millions of people all over the world experience muscle wasting because of a variety of reasons .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , this problem affects over 805 million people worldwide .\nWhat is more prevalent in a country such as Canada is sarcopenia .\nThis an age-related decline in muscle mass stemming from anabolic insensitivity .\nThis affects everyone as it leads to a 30 to 50 percent decline in skeletal muscle mass as long as they reach ages 40 to 80 .\n\u201c The mechanisms that mammals like the 13-lined ground squirrel have naturally evolved to maintain protein balance in their own nitrogen-limited situations may inform

during a two-month follow up of the study , in the treatment area , crime was reduced by 5-7 % , although it was not in the control areas .\nEventually , this reduction did fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was due to the limited scope and light touch of the intervention .\nShould there have been more or longer sustained contact with the NCOs , they do believe that the result would have had a longer sustained

the usual or regular types of strategies when dealing with crime result in the \u2018 same reduction as the information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn addition , the usual type of strategies tend to lessen in their effectivity quite quickly , while also being much more expensive as well .\nThe authors also note that door-to-door visits by police officers also have a \u2018 greater effect on crime reduction than other components of neighborhood policing \u2019 such as the neighborhood watch that many communities practice .\nCommenting on the findings in Nature , Elicia John & Shawn D.

steel eco-friendly by using hydrogen to replace coal as a carbon input , creating \u201c green steel.\n\u201d Hysata , the Australian firm , even made changes to the design of the major component to find a way to make the cost of pure hydrogen fuel competitive with fossil fuels .\nThey did this by decreasing the heat and resistance that usually occurs during the process of separating hydrogen .\nHysata \u2019 s chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Univ .\nof Wollongong , New South Wales , Gerry Swiegers , to the publication The Guardian , \u201c What we did differently was just to start completely over and to think about it from a very high level .\nEveryone else was looking at improving materials or an existing design.\n\u201d A scientific paper , which was published in Nature , demonstrated their new electroylyzer \u2019 s potential .\nFirst , they outlined the problem with the old ones , which was showing that \u2018 even state-of-the-art water electrolyzers typically require at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 kg of hydrogen , which contains 39.4 kWh of energy : a deficit of 12.\n\u2019 But before we can truly understand why that deficit exists , it \u2019 s important to understand how these devices work in the first place .\nSimply explained by the Fuel Cell & Hydrogen Energy Assocation , an electrolyzer consists of \u2018 an anode and a cathode separated by a sponge-like membrane .\nH20 is sent into the anode , where its electrons are stripped and turned into electricity , powering whatever it \u2019 s connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross through the membrane into the cathode , where oxygen is pulled into .\nThere , the protons , reunited with their electrons post-electricity harvest , combine with the oxygen to form water and heat : the only emissions.\n\u2019 When it comes to Hysata , they are making a big change from their former traditions through their electrolyzer \u2019 s circular shape .\nThe hydrophilic membrane sits in just a bit of an electrolyte reservoir in the same place where the water enters .\nThen the membrane \u2018 continuously pulls up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that allow electrolysis to occur without the formation of hydrogen gas bubbles \u2019 that are very typical of electrolyzers that usually house the anode and cathode completely within the hydrogen reservoir .\nThese gas bubbles then block the physical access to the catalyst on the anode and cathode , with reduces their efficiency .\nMoreover , the elimination of the gas bubble problem ends in Hysata \u2019 s success rate of 95 % , or roughly 41.5 kWh per kilogram of hydrogen .\nIn addition , Hysata isn \u2019 t just about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also make sense since the membranes are not only easy to manufacture , but the process can also be automated at scale , they share .\nThe International Renewables Energy Agency has set a 2050 target to invent new and innovative ways of electrolysis that will lessen the kWh required per kilogram that \u2019 s produced at 42 .\nHysata is currently the only company anywhere that has achieved that .\nOne example of this is if a long-haul trucking sector needed 1 million tons of hydrogen annually , producing that with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 3 billion .\nNow that \u2019 s impressive .\nWhat are your thoughts ?\nPlease comment below and share this news !", "author": "True Activist", "url":

"Methane-Eating Bacteria Can Be Converted From Greenhouse Gas To Fuel", "content": "A study in ScienceDirect explains that methanotrophic bacteria has the ability to \u2018 utilize methane as their sole carbon and energy source.\n\u2019 And what this partially means is that it can consume at least 30 million metric tons of methane per year , which is something that has interested scientists and researchers due to its natural ability to convert this potent greenhouse gas into usable fuel .\nYet regardless of this amazing ability , scientists still don \u2019 t know much about how such a complex reaction actually occurs , which in turn limits the ability of researchers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planet \u2019 s advantage .\nA team at Northwestern University has been studying the enzyme that the bacteria uses to catalyze the reaction , and has since discovered the key structures that may possibly be driving this process in the first place .\nWhat these findings mean is that they could eventually \u2018 lead to the development of human-made biological catalysts that convert methane gas into methanol.\n\u2019 Senior author of the paper , Amy Rosenzweig , from Northwestern , explained , \u201c Methane has a very strong bond , so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enzyme that can do this .\nIf we don \u2019 t understand exactly how the enzyme performs this difficult chemistry , we \u2019 re not going to be able to engineer and optimize it for biotechnological applications.\n\u201d The enzyme in question is called particulate methane monooxygenase ( pMMO ) , which is a rather difficult protein to study since it \u2019 s \u2018 embedded in the cell membrane of the bacteria.\n\u2019 Normally when the scientists study the methanotrophic bacteria , they use a harsh process where they use a detergent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ membranes .\nAlthough the procedure manages to isolate the enzyme effectively , it tends to kill the enzyme activity , which then limits the amount of information that the researchers can gather .\nThey liken it to monitoring a heart without the heart having a heartbeat .\nFor this particular study , the team used a different and new technique completely .\nThe first author , Christopher Koo , who happens to be a Ph.D. candidate in Rosenzweig \u2019 s lab , thought about what would happen if they put the enzyme back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native environment , to see if they could possible learn something new .\nRather , Koo decided to use lipids from the bacteria to form a membrane within the protective particle called a nanodisc , after which , he embedded the enzyme into the membrane .\nKoo shared , \u201c By recreating the enzyme \u2019 s native environment within the nanodisc , we were able to restore activity to the enzyme .\nThen , we were able to use structural techniques to determine at the atomic level how the lipid bilayer restored activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full arrangement of the copper site in the enzyme where methane oxidation likely occurs.\n\u201d The researchers also share that they use a particular type of technique called cryo-electron microscopy ( cryo-EM ) , which is known to be well-suited to membrane proteins \u2018 because the lipid membrane environment is undisturbed throughout the experiment.\n\u2019 What this did was allow them to \u2018 visualize the atomic structure of the active enzyme at high resolution for the first time.\n\u2019 Rosenzweig said , \u201c As a consequence of the recent \u2018 resolution revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the structure in atomic detail .\nWhat we saw completely changed the way we were thinking about the active site of this enzyme.\n\u201d Rosenzweig explained that the cryo-EM structures give a new starting point to provide answers to the questions that are still coming forward , such as \u2018 How does methane travel to the enzyme active site ?\nOr methanol travel out of the enzyme ?\nHow does the copper in the active site do the chemical reaction ?\nNext , the team plans to study the enzyme directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imaging technique called cryo-electron tomography ( cryo-ET ) .\n\u2019 Should the study be successful , the research group will be able to see just how the enzyme is arranged in the cell membrane , as well as figure out how it will operate in its true and native environment .\nThey will also figure out if the other proteins that surround the enzyme actually interact with it or not .\nAll of these discoveries will also provide vital notes to engineers .\nYou may read more about the research study in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts ?\nPlease

acres of land in total .\nNurture \u2019 s data shows that compared to burning , it has already made a major advances already where it \u2019 s been used .\nAlready , it has had a 25 % reduction in costs for farmers from no longer needed to buy artificial fertilizer .\nThere has also been a 20 % increase in the farmer \u2019 s income from their ability to rotate their short term crops , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nurture , Dhruv Sawhney , said , \u201c It was exhilarating to see that in all the fields where the spraying protocol was followed , the stubble started to decompose within just eight days .\nThis garnered the farmer \u2019 s trust and appreciation , which was highly motivating for us.\n\u201d He added , \u201c We \u2019 ve emerged more confident and determined post phase-1 of the

saw that the \u2018 split gill fungi spikes were even more closely identical to the average world length in the Greek language .\nAround fifty \u2018 words \u2019 could be identified based on

Southern California residents , the need for a more efficient agriculture has once again been highlighted , except this time , a new statewide composting mandate might just be the answer to the state \u2019 s ongoing issues .\nWith California being the leading food production nation in the United States , it means that they require tons of water for production .\nAnd now that California has become the next state in the nation to make large-scale composting a requirement by law , after Vermont , it looks like they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all work out for the better .\nThe first week of May is actually Compost Awareness Week , and while it may not sound too serious or official , it \u2019 s actually quite important .\nFarmers can actually grow up to 40 percent more food during times of drought by using compost , so having residents help in their own way \u2013 like throwing banana peels and used coffee grounds into a specific bin for pick up \u2013 they are not only feeding the soil for the farmers to use , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the state .\nHow these city composting programs work is that they produce thousands of truckloads of finishing compost , which eventually go onto vineyards , farms , and orchards .\nAs a result , they create a natural sponge that helps attract and retain necessary moisture , which in turn also helps fight global warming .\nStatistics show that there is a whopping 20 % of food waste that fills up landfills , which does a lot of harm to the environment .\nIn fact , when the food in landfills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas known as methane , which is said to be \u2018 ten times more potent than carbon dioxide.\n\u2019 Moreover , it is also one of the major greenhouse gasses that is continuing to fuel the climate crisis in the United States , not to mention the fact that landfills are \u2018 the third-largest source of methane emissions in the U.S. \u2019 Since San Francisco led the group and implemented curbside collection of food scraps used for composting , over 200 cities from all over the United States , as well as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco \u2019 s example .\nThe new law , SB 1383 , is requiring California cities to reduce landfilling of compostable materials by 75 percent by the year 2025 .\nThis means that districts all throughout the state are establishing curbside programs that provide bins for food scraps , leaves , and sticks , which will be turned into \u2018 black gold \u2019 compost for all the many farmers .\nIn this light , Recology \u2013 a San Francisco-based employee-owned company has a workforce of 3,800 that operate at least 8 composting facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that serves almost 150 communities .\nJust in 2020 , they managed to recycle more than 810,000 tons of organic waste that included yard trimmings and food scraps .\nAccording to Robert Reed of Recology , \u201c This program gives individuals , communities and entire municipalities a way to do something very useful to help slow climate

eliminating thousands of tons of methane emissions as well , which helped local farmers grow more healthy , and tasty , food despite using less fertilizer and less water .\nAgronomist , Ed Davis , of

growing.\n\u201d When it comes to landfills , food scraps end up getting buried under the dirt and decomposing in an airless environment .\nAlthough any type of composting process will make sure that microbes get air and water , which doesn \u2019 t generate methane .\nExcept it would be far less than what would be generated in a landfill .\nBut , Recology manages to capture the gasses that are generated at key stages of the composting process , which reroutes them through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methane emissions by over a massive 80 percent .\nDue to the program \u2019 s success , delegations from at least 135 counties have gone to San Francisco to take a look at the program for themselves .\nIt was later on implemented at UC Berkeley and UC Davis , in Marin County and 11 other cities in the

people .\nAnd apparently , an examination of at least 50 engraved stones that have been recently unearthed in France have revealed that they may have also created intricate artwork by firelight as

dollars\u2014most of which literally ends up in the drain , \u201d Sushant Anand , assistant professor of mechanical engineering , said .\n\u201c We thought , why not improve such chemicals themselves , and make alternatives that can last longer while being more biofriendly .\nAnd that is what we ended up doing.\n\u201d Working with Ph.D. student Rukmava Chatterjee , they were able to achieve their goal .\nThey developed 80 different anti-freezing coatings .\nThese come under different classifications such as polymeric solutions , emulsions , or gels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to different surfaces made from aluminum , steel , copper , glass , plastic or any industrial surface .\nThere \u2019 s no need for preconditioning or expensive surface treatments to do this .\n\u201c Our coatings are an all-in-one package which can delay formation of frost for extended hours , and simultaneously cause any ice formed on its surface to easily shed off by a gentle breeze or simple substrate tilting , \u201d Chatterjee said .\nThe anti-freezing gels have been made to be transparent .\nThis is important especially when used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assist pilots during landings , automotive windshields , and building windows .\nIn order to create the product , they worked with phase change materials .\nThey chose this because these had a melting point above the freezing point of water ( 0 degrees C ) .\nSimply put , under sub-zero temperatures , the materials stay in a solid state .\nThis is very much similar to chocolate , butter , and even water .\nThe multifunctional coatings can stop ice and bacteria from sticking on surfaces no matter the inherent material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by regulating how chemicals leach out of the material system and how it creates a lubricating surface layer .\nThe nature of the layer is slippery and it does not freeze .\nChatterjee had spoken to GNN about this .\nHe said that he and his PhD advisor Prof. Anand came into the idea in 2016 .\n\u201c It was February and I was flying out from Chicago to deliver a talk in an international conference on ice/frost protection technologies .\nQuite an irony !\nIt was a frigid winter day and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues .\nAs a plane full of frustrated passengers waited inside the aircraft for two hours , we watched the plane getting dowsed continuously with thousands of gallons to prepare it for a safe take-off .\nLater , I missed my next connecting flight due to this delay and had to drive overnight to the conference venue.\n\u201d He continued , \u201c Since then we have been researching , formulating compositions & exhaustively testing them under real-life winter conditions to address this long standing issue .\nBeing liquid , all these chemicals get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment the flight takes off .\nOur idea was to use certain materials which are solid when cold.\n\u201d The gels have performed better than the rest .\nIn fact , this had a significant edge against the formulations available in the market .\nThey are very simple to fabricate because you only need two components .\nOnce done , these can be cured/sprayed/painted/coated on any surface quickly and easily .\nShape won \u2019 t be an issue and even better is that these are optically transparent even when temperatures dip below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Advanced Materials .\nFindings show that when compared to commercial coatings of today , the gel works more efficiently by an order of magnitude after exhaustive testing .\nChatterjee explained to GNN how the gels are also anti-bacterial in nature .\n\u201c Imagine coating your smart-watch ( or any wearable electronic ) with this gel and using it in winter .\nIt can potentially prevent your watch \u2019 s battery from dying in the cold while also preventing it from bacterial contamination , thereby precluding the need for constant sanitization.\n\u201d For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coated a propeller blade .\nThey then tested its anti-frosting performance by taking it out in below zero winter conditions .\nThese coatings were also exposed to very high shear airflow , very much similar to a hurricane .\nThe anti-frosting performance was observed after .\nThe more exhaustive testing was also performed on actual airplanes in wind-turbines .\nThis was to make sure that they passed the industrial test requirements before they were exposed to real-life usage .\nThe inventors promised a significant improvement over the commercial solutions our right now .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Methods for Inhibiting Ice Formation on Surfaces \u201d had already been filed by UIC \u2019 s Office of

@ @ ICP process uses an electrical field to membranes that are put above and below a channel of water .\nThen the membranes repel negatively or positively charged particles , such as salt molecules , viruses , and bacteria , as they flow past .\nThen the charged particles are funneled into a second stream of water that is eventually released .\nDuring the process , both dissolved and suspended solids are removed , which allows clean water to pass through the channel .\nAnd since it requires such a low-pressure pump , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technique .\nHowever , the ICP doesn \u2019 t always remove all the salts that float in the middle of the channel .\nBecause of this , the researchers incorporated a second process called electrodialysis in order to remove the remaining salt ions .\nResearchers Yoon and Kang \u2018 use machine learning to find the ideal combination of ICP and electrodialysis modules.\n\u2019 As a result , the optimal setup includes a two-stage ICP process that needs the water to flow through six modules in the first stage , then another three in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrodialysis process .\nYet this minimized energy usage ensures that the process remains self-cleaning .\nYoon shares , \u201c While it is true that some charged particles could be captured on the ion exchange membrane , if they get trapped , we just reverse the polarity of the electric field and the charged particles can be easily removed.\n\u201d After , they shrunk and stacked the ICP and electrodialysis modules in order to improve their energy efficiency while enabling them to fit inside a portable device .\nThe researchers also designed the device @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is why it just takes on button to launch the automatic desalination and purification process .\nThen the device notifies the user that the water is drinkable after the salinity level and the number of particles decrease to specific thresholds .\nThen , the scientists also created a smartphone app that can control the unit wirelessly , alongside a report of real-time data on power consumption and water salinity .\nAfter the team ran lab experiments using water with different salinity and turbidity ( cloudiness ) levels , they field-tested the device @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They set the box near the shore of the beach , and placed the feed tube into the water .\nThen around half an hour later , the device

main reason we were successful is the accumulation of all these little advances that we made along the way.\n\u201d Moreover , the water even exceeded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to lessen the amount of suspended solids by at least a factor of 10 .\nTheir prototype makes drinking water at a rage of 0.3 liters per hour , while only needing 20 watts of power per liter .\nYoon shares , \u201c Right now , we are pushing our research scale up that production rate.\n\u201d According to Han , one of the biggest challenges that came with designing this new portable system was engineering an intuitive device that could be used by anyone .\nThe hope , according to Yoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ user-friendly , while improving its energy efficiency and production rate through a startup which he plans to launch in order to commercialize the technology .\nIn addition , Han wants to apply the lessons that he \u2019 s learned over the past decade in the lab to water-quality issues that go even beyond desalination , like being able to quickly detect contaminants in drinking water .\nHe adds , \u201c This is definitely an exciting project , and I am proud of the progress we have made so far , but

lead into gold .\nAnd today , the idea of generating valuable materials from majorly abundant resources is also what leads scientists in their continued pursuit of golden opportunities .\nIn fact , the U.S. Department of Energy \u2019 s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory ( PNNL ) is working hand in hand with other companies in order to test the possibility of using magnetic nanoparticles to capture critical materials , like lithium , from a variety of wastewater sources .\nCurrently , lithium has become one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of energy and electronic technologies , which includes the lightweight lithium-ion batteries that power everything these days , from smartphones to tablets to electric vehicles .\nThis also means that the global market for lithium is monstrous , yet only very

.\nMoreover , lithium is present in most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas and oil extractions across the United States and Canada .\nThe PNNL scientists also estimate that \u2018 if just 25 percent of the lithium in such water were collected today , it would equal the current annual worldwide production.\n\u2019 There is ongoing testing , which involves PNNL , Conoco Phillips , Moselle Technologies , and Natural Resources Canada .\nAccording to PNNL , the team is also stress-testing the technology by \u201c subjecting it to extended cycle testing with the magnetic separator system , a needed step for full-scale industrial production.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerry Mills , which has licensed the technology and hopes to pilot it in a number of locations said , \u201c By using the magnetic nanoparticles to

are doing their part to come up with incredible solutions to flight climate change .\nThey have managed to create a dirt-cheap solution that helps lessen methane emissions in the air , which is one of the leading causes of global warming .\nAnd even more amazing , they \u2019 re using minerals that are normally found in regular cat litter .\nMethane happens to be the most potent of all greenhouse gases , more than carbon dioxide for that matter .\nAnd it is also the most emitted by such origins as mining , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctoral student Rebecca Brenneis , who wrote the paper where the findings were published in the ACS Environment Au journal , says \u201c A lot of the methane is from distributed and diffuse sources , so we started to think about how you could take that out of the atmosphere.\n\u201d The MIT team of scientists , including Associate Professor Desiree Plata , joined together to develop this new approach that utilizes the overly abundant and low-cost type of \u201c dirt \u201d or clay named zeolite .\nIn fact , zeolite clays are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are actually used to make cat litter .\nThe team found that the manufacturers treat the zeolite with small portions of copper , which makes the material quite effective at absorbing methane from the air , even if they are in very low concentrations at that .\nWhen they did their lab tests , the packed miniscule particles of the copper-enhanced zeolite material into a reaction tube , then heated from the outside as the stream of gas , keeping methane levels kept in between the ranges from just 2 parts per million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowed through the tube .\nThey also explained that \u2018 that range covers everything that might exist in the atmosphere , down to subflammable levels that can not be burned or flared directly.\n\u2019 Piata shared that the process has a number of advantages over the other approaches to eliminating the methane from air .\nOther types of methods normally use pricey catalysts , like palladium or platinum , which need extreme temperatures of at least 600 degrees Celsius , while also normally needing risky and complex processes involving oxygen , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methane .\nAccording to Brenneis , \u201c The 600 degrees where they run these reactors makes it almost dangerous to be around the methane.\n\u201d Shared in the MIT News , Plata shared , \u201c I think we \u2019 re still surprised at how well it works.\n\u201d Moreover , MIT uses a process that can work at methane concentrations that are lower than other methods , by even small fractions of 1 percent , which most methods fail to remove .\nIn addition , they can do this in air instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage for real-world deployment , they explain .\nThis method also converts the methane into carbon dioxide , and while that may seem like a bad thing due to the continuous worldwide efforts to combat the carbon dioxide emissions , Plata explains that carbon dioxide is much less impactful in the atmosphere as compared to methane , which happens to be around \u2018 80 times stronger as a greenhouse gas over the first 20 years , and about 25 times stronger for the first century.\n\u2019 The scientists also share that \u2018 even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methane to carbon dioxide would increase CO2 levels by less than 1 part per million ( about 0.2 percent of today \u2019 s atmospheric carbon dioxide ) while saving about 16 percent of total radiative warming.\n\u2019 The most ideal locations to collect the gases would be at coal mines and dairy barns .\nMost of the time , these areas have incredibly strong air-handling systems in use , mostly because methane buildup has a tendency to be a health , fire , and explosion hazard otherwise .\nThe U.S. Department of Energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million grant in order to continue doing their research and developing particular equipment for the removal of methane in these types of locations and areas .\nFor the next phase of their research , the team will focus on ways to mold and structure the clay material so that it will help with the flow of bigger volumes of gas .\nThe scientists cite one possible major advantage that this new system has , which is that the chemical process used releases heat .\nAs the methane is oxidized , the process outcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When then methane concentration sits above 0.5 percent , the released heat is bigger than the heat that \u2019 s used to get the process started , and the heat that is released can be used to create excess electricity .\nAccording to Plata , the team \u2019 s calculations show that \u201c at coal mines , you could potentially generate enough heat to generate electricity at the power plant scale , which is remarkable because it means that the device could pay for itself.\n\u201d Within the next 18 months , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more challenging conditions other than what they \u2019 ve done in their lab .\nIn the end , the hope is that they

that it was a disarray because it had become a chemical wasteland .\nThe water and soil there were so polluted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t happen overnight .\nIn fact , it took them decades , but the

Ecologist for Cuyahoga Valley National Park , Chris Davis .\nThe tragedy started when the Krejci ( krech-ee ) family opened up a dump along a river between Akron and Cleveland in 1940 .\nThis happened before municipal waste management even became an idea .\nThe people in the area had been left responsible for their own waste disposal , and Krejci family unwittingly offered them a far-off place to

that X-ray explosions such as this , but they have actually never been observed directly , until this time .\nThese fireballs of X-rays happen on the stars \u2019 surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun before they used up most of their fuel , which is made of hydrogen and later on helium deep within their cores .\nThese \u2018 stellar corpses \u2019 shrivel up until all that remains are \u201c white dwarfs , \u201d which are usually similar in size to the Earth but have a mass that can be similar to that of the sun .\nExplained by J\u00f6rn Wilms , \u201c One way to picture these proportions is to think of the Sun being the same size as an apple , which means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pin head orbiting around the apple at a distance of 10 meters.\n\u201d These Stellar Corpses Look Like Gemstones The scientists also explained that on the other hand , if you shrink an apple to the same size of a pin head , this small particle would still keep it \u2019 s comparatively large weight of the apple .\nWilms shares , \u201c A teaspoon of matter from the inside of a white dwarf easily has the same mass as a large truck.\n\u201d They also explain that since these burnt out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carbon , which can be compared to gigantic diamonds that are the same size as Earth as they float around in space .\nThese objects , which are in the form of precious gems , are so hot that they actually glow white .\nYet , the radiation is so weak , making it hard to detect from Earth .\nThat is , unless the white dwarf is accompanied by a star that happens to still be burning , or when the massive gravitational pull of the white dwarf draws hydrogen from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FAU astrophysicist Wilms says , \u201c It time , this hydrogen can collect to form a layer only a few meters thick on the surface of the white dwarf.\n\u201d At this layer , the massive gravitational pull produces such huge pressure that \u2019 s so great , it makes the star reignite .\nIn a chain reaction , it eventually becomes a major explosion where the layer of hydrogen is blown off .\nThe X-ray radiation of an explosion this huge is what managed to hit the eROSITA detectors on July 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image .\nThe results , which were published in the Nature journal , the white dwarf has around the same mass as the sun , making it relatively large .\nThe explosion produced a fireball with a temperature of around 327,000 degrees , which makes it almost sixty times hotter than the sun .\nThese novae tend to run out of fuel quite fast , and they also cool rapidly , which makes the X-ray radiation becomes weaker until it becomes visible light eventually .\nThis is what reached Earth half a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eROSITA which was seen by the optical telescopes .\nOle K\u00f6nig said , \u201c A seemingly bright star then appeared , which was actually the visible light from the explosion , and so bright that it could be seen on the night sky by the bare eye.\n\u201d Apparently \u201c new stars \u201d such as this one have been observed in the past , and they were named \u201c nova stella \u201d or \u201c new star \u201d precisely because of their unpredictable appearance .\nBut because these novae are only visible after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to predict such outbreaks , left mostly to chance when these flashes hit the X-ray detectors .\nK\u00f6nig said , \u201c We were really lucky.\n\u201d Take a look at the

like outdoor furniture or playground equipment , roads are not specifically designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , roads are prone to cracking , making them pretty unsafe to drive on in certain situations .\nBy incorporating recycled rubber in the roads , it offers sun protection while becoming a more sustainable solution to the used-tire crisis that many countries are dealing with , including Australia , which has put an export ban on used tires since December 2020 .\nAlthough there has been a lot of research that has focused on the improvement of durability of roads when it comes to traffic load , weather-related events , sun damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have been given much attention , until now at least .\nThe new study , which was led by RMIT \u2019 s Associate Professor Filippo Giustozzi , is now providing a sustainable solution to UV protection for the roads .\nGiustozzi shared , \u201c We found that the ageing trend is actually slowed down when you add crumb rubber , which is recycled from scrap tires , into the top layer of a road.\n\u201d He added , \u201c This acts so effectively as a sunscreen for roads that it actually makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular bitumen .\nWe knew that UV would be a factor in road degradation , but not by what degree or how to protect against it , as nobody has really been looking at this aspect.\n\u201d RMIT happens to be one of the few universities in Australia that has a UV machine for use in asphalt studies .\nThe machine can stimulate weather-related ageing , while also being used for testing outdoor furniture paints .\nGiustozzi and his team

The team measured the changes in bitumen \u2019 s chemical and mechanical properties after a month and a half of continuous exposure in the UV machine , which is equivalent to around a year of UV radiation in Melbourne , Australia .\nAccording to Giustozzi , the bitumen mixed with the high concentration of crumb rubber from recycled tires resulted in 50 % less UV damage as compared @ @ @ @ @ @

end-of-line tires in 2021 alone , only around 70 % of those tires were actually reprocessed or recycled .\nGoodman also shared that they were inspired by the research , which showcased major viability and benefits of using crumb rubber from end-of-life tires , especially since they have benefits for both the roads and civil infrastructure , as well as over a number of different sectors .\nGoodman

meals .\nThese leftovers are rich in protein and remain after the oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe NTU-led research team used the oilseed meals from two common vegetable oils : sunflower and peanut oils .\nThey extracted the proteins from oilseed meals and then turned them into nano-sized protein amyloid fibrils .\nThese are proteins twisted tightly together and look like ropes .\nThese protein fibrils are attracted to heavy metals .\nOnce they come into contact with it , they act like a molecular sieve as they trap these heavy metal ions as soon as they go near it .\n\u201c This is the

whopping 123 percent more crop yield .\nThey compared the results with the traditional organic farming practices that also made use of cow urine-enriched compost .\nIt also had a 100 percent greater crop yield as opposed to the use of nitrogen-potassium-phosphorus fertilizer .\nThe best part about biochar is its scalability , ease-of-use , and remarkable lowering in the emissions from fertilizer production .\nThis is considered as a breakout moment in the crop department .\nRight now , some governments have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dollars just so they can develop innovative methods that help stop climate change .\nBiochar simply asks for an extra step when one does his or her bi-weekly yardwork tasks .\nIn 2019 , according to Bloomberg Philanthropies , Minneapolis was \u201c blown away \u201d by how this solution was .\nIn fact , they were so happy with it that ever since , they \u2019 ve been bringing truckloads of biochar into town from a biochar plant in Missouri .\nMinneapolis

as well as spiked claws .\nThis creature also lived in the Cambrian Explosion period as explained by paleontologists , which was said to have quite rapid evolution in shallow seas .\nThis was also when most of the major animal groups emerged in the fossil record as well .\nThis particular creature was a member of the radiodonts family , which was a type of early arthropod .\nThey were basically creepy crawlies with jointed limbs that were measured at 3-feet in length , and were the major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basically the great white shark of their time .\nBut while this creature \u2019 s strange

look into what the ancestral nervous system looked like .\nThat \u2019 s also because finding ay fossilized soft tissue is incredibly rare , which made this discovery extra special and unique .\nFrom the 84 of the 268 creatures found at Burgees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prehistoric graveyard in the Canadian Rocky Mountains , the brain and nerves were incredibly still preserved , despite the passing of 506 million years on earth .\nAnd the analysis of these creatures and their makeup was even published in the journal , Current Biology .\nNormally , most of the fossils that are unearthed tend to be hard body parts , like teeth or exoskeletons that have turned into mineral casts .\nSince brains and nerves are made from fatty-like substances , they don \u2019 t normally survive throughout the years .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moysiuk , who happens to be a PhD candidate from the University of Toronto , shared , \u201c We can even make out visual processing centers serving the large eyes and traces of nerves entering the appendages .\nThe fine details are so clear it is as if we were looking at an animal that died yesterday.\n\u201d When it comes to the central nervous systems , this is what coordinates

series of interconnected masses of nervous tissue that happens to resemble a strong of beads .\nMeanwhile , the Stanleycaris \u2018 brain was made up of two segments , namely the protocerebrum and the deutocerebrum .\nThese are what connected the eyes and frontal claws , while also controlling vision and antenna signals in the arthropods you see today .\nMoysiuk also said , \u201c We conclude a two segmented head and brain has deep roots in the arthropod lineage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ segmented brain that characterizes all living members of this diverse animal phylum.\n\u201d When it comes to arthropod organs , there are a number of repeated copies of these found in their segmented bodies .\nSo by figuring out how they line up is also the key to better understanding their diversification .\nAside from the pair of stalked eyes , the Stanleycaris also had a large central peeper at the front of its head , which is a feature that has never been seen before in a radiodont .\nAccording to co-author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201c The presence of a huge third eye in Stanleycaris was unexpected .\nIt emphasizes these animals were even more bizarre-looking than we thought .\nIt also shows us the earliest arthropods had already evolved a variety of complex visual systems like many of their modern kin.\n\u201d During the Cambrian period , radiodonts were considered to be among the biggest animals .\nAt that time , the Anomalocaris , which has been named \u2018 weird wonder , \u2019 was at least 3 feet 3 inches in size , making it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually means \u2018 radiating teeth.\n\u2019 These strange and unique animals were named after their toothy , circular jaws , while also adapting to their darker deep water environment .\nThe Stanleycaris , on the other hand , was considered to be much smaller .\nHowever , it would have also been quite the impressive killer since it was at least three times of the size of most of its rivals .\nMoysiuk went on to share , \u201c With large compound eyes , a formidable looking circular mouth lined with teeth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spines , and a flexible , segmented body with a series of swimming flaps along its sides , Stanleycaris would have been the stuff of nightmares for any small bottom dweller unfortunate enough to cross its path.\n\u201d Most of these samples were collected back in the 1980s and 1990s , and they now sit in a one of

flashing with regularity , which came much as a surprise to all of them .\nThe signal that they heard was classified as a fast radio burst , or what is otherwise known as FRB .\nThis means is what

seconds .\nThere was obviously a periodic pattern to it and they compared this to a heartbeat .\nThe source of the signal came from a far-off galaxy which was approximately several billion light-years away from Earth .\nWhere that sound came from still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who heard it suspect that the signal could come from either a radio pulsar or a magnetar \u201c on steroids \u201d .\nThese are types of neutron stars , which are very dense , rapidly spinning collapsed cores coming from the giant stars .\n\u201c There are not many things in the universe that emit strictly periodic signals , \u201d

at McGill University , and then he had a postdoc which he took at MIT .\nAs for now , the signal was called FRB 20191221A by the researchers .\nAt this point , this is considered to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day that came with the clearest periodic pattern .\nThe first ever FRB was discovered in 2007 .\nSince then , there have been hundreds of similar radio flashes that came from different areas across the galaxy , the most recent of which came from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment , or CHIME .\nThis is an interferometric radio telescope made up of 4 large parabolic reflectors that are found at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory in British Columbia , Canada .\nCHIME still observes the sky as the Earth rotates to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to pick up radio waves that come from hydrogen in its in earliest form in the universe .\nThe telescope is also extremely sensitive to quick radio bursts .\nIt has done so since it directed its watchful eye to the sky in 2018

bursts of radio waves that last for a few milliseconds as it then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researchers came upon the first periodic FRB that seemed to send out radio waves in regular patterns .\nThis signal consisted is made up of a four-day window of sporadic bursts .\nThis had continuously repeated every 16 days .\nThis specific cycle meant that there was a presence of a periodic pattern of activity .\nIt must be noted , however , that the signal that came from the actual radio bursts was random instead of it being periodic .\nTwo years ago , on December 21 , 2019 , CHIME caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential FRB .\nThis caught the attention of Michilli , since she was the one who was scanning for the incoming data .\n\u201c It was unusual , \u201d he shared .\n\u201c Not only was it very long , lasting about three seconds , but there were periodic peaks that were remarkably precise , emitting every fraction of a second \u2014 boom , boom , boom \u2014 like a heartbeat .\nThis is the first

magnetars that came from our very own galaxy .\nRadio pulsars are actually neutron stars that bring forth beams of radio waves that appear to beat like a heart as the star rotates .\nMagnetars also emit similar emissions because of their extreme magnetic fields .\nHowever , there are also differences between the new signal and radio emissions from our own pulsars and magnetars .\nWhat makes this

to hope that they can still catch more bursts from the periodic FRB 20191221A .\nThis will help them understanding the source more and generally learn more about neutron stars .\n\u201c This detection

go ?\nThe tides carry them to far-off places and most end up in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch ( or what they call GPGP ) .\nWhat exactly is this and are efforts being made to clean up the area

creates a very stable , yet dirty center .\nThe accumulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things around it .\nThus , people have been searching for ways to clean it up ever since its discovery .\nJust the previous year , a very smart young man named Boyan Slat announced that \u201c The Great Pacific Garbage Patch can now be cleaned.\n\u201d He came up with a prototype cleaning system and this proved to work extremely well .\nSince the prototype had been deployed last August 2021 , System 02 ( or \u201c Jenny \u201d ) had become famous to the world .\nThat \u2019 s because Jenny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 220,000

Luxembourg or Rhode Island , which is quite a feat on its own .\n\u201c Added to the 7,173 kg of plastic captured by our previous prototype systems , The Ocean Cleanup has now collected 108,526 kg of plastic from the \u201c GPGP \u201d \u2014more than the combined weight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the dry weight of a space shuttle , \u201d Slat had mentioned .\nAccording to a 2018 study that had been organized by The Ocean Cleanup to map the GPGP , the total amount of accumulated plastic is said to be a whopping 79,000,000 kg , or 100,000,000 kg if the exterior areas are covered in the count .\nWhile the idea that 100,000 kilograms were extracted in just a little over the years , it \u2019 s still a step forward .\nHowever , this will also imply that they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely clean up the area .\nNot to fret because Slat has come up with even better ideas that will cut the time significantly .\n\u201c System 03 , which is expected to capture plastic at a rate potentially 10 times higher than System 002 through a combination of increased size , improved efficiency , and increased uptime , will be starting soon , \u201d Slat shared .\nThis means that System 03 will go

especially down in the middle of Alabama .\nBut thankfully , due to the state \u2019 s Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation program , something beautiful has sprouted out from the so-called ashes , a wildlife refuge of natural beauty that \u2019 s brought thousands of tourists to come in troves in order to be able to take photos of this rare yet gorgeous white lily .\n20 years ago , the state managed to acquire the land , but in doing so , manager Steven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cahaba River National Wildlife Refuge , also shares that they acquired a problem as well .\nHowever , lately , he also shares that there has been a magnificent transformation in the area that has happened quite quickly .\nHe explains , \u201c Being able to clean it up and stop the chemicals from going into the Cahaba River is a wonderful thing on so many levels.\n\u201d The Cahaba River is considered to be an ecological marvel in Alabama , considering this river has been dumped upon , badly degraded , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ springs and cascades 190 miles to the Alabama River .\nAround three-fourths of the river happens to be free-flowing , which is also the longest stretch of unblocked river in the state of Alabama as well .\nAs it goes beyond Birmingham , the Cahaba river flows through the rolling hills , which also marks the end of the Appalachian Mountains , showing up rocky shoals that are along the river \u2019 s upper portions without any riverside development in that area .\nMoreover , the Cahaba is also home to an incredible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other river in North America of the same size can claim .\nIn fact , around fifty of the continent \u2019 s 300 types of mussels can be found in the river as well , with around 10 percent of North America \u2019 s gill-breathing freshwater snail species too .\nBut these weren \u2019 t the stars of the river , but actually the white Cahaba lily \u2013 also known as the shoals spider-lily \u2013 that drew such huge crowds of nature enthusiasts .\nWhile the flower is considered rare , it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so to speak .\nYet it was spoken about by 18th century naturalist William Bartram who said that \u201c nothing in vegetable nature was more pleasing.\n\u201d The Cahaba River was actually named after these lilies , and they usually bloom around spring .\nBecause of how beautiful they are , people from far-off Canada and even Upstate New York travel there just to see it .\nAlthough these fragrant white lilies don \u2019 t bloom very long \u2013 with each flower opening overnight and lasting for just one day \u2013 the actual @ @ @ @ @

return the following year to wait , camera in hand , for their next bloom .\nThere is even a Cahaba Lily Festival yearly , which happened to attract around 1,000 carloads of people during the last festival .\nBut for Manager Steven Trull , he hopes that they can create a year-round recreation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tuscaloosa city and Birmingham city .\nThe Hymenocallis coronaria also grows in the Carolinas and Georgia , since these states also have swift-moving waters , lots of sunlight , and rocky shoals that these lilies require to survive .\nThis is also why the species is considered imperiled because of all the dams that have been built along the rivers .\nThis flower also reaches around 3 feet in height , or 0.9 meters , developing from a bulb that usually lodges itself in the cracks of the rocky shoals .\nThey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petals , as well as nectar that is alluring to many pollinators .\nHow The Are Cleaning the Water At least nine wastewater treatment plants are using the Cahaba River that sits between Birmingham and the refuge , but issues such as failing septic tanks , agricultural runoff , residential and industrial development contributed to the water-quality issues .\nMoreover , wildlife officials had no choice but to deal with the pollution that came from abandoned mining operations such as toxic chemicals , sedimentation , and heavy metals .\nCurrently , the refuge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secured an additional $ 5 million in mine-reclamation money which is used to clean up the waste that comes from the mine .\nAlongside other partners , the refuge will also use another $ 735,000 in funding to help prevent wildfires , lessen woody undergrowth , which will benefit the native plants and longleaf pines as well .\nThen in 2021 , the Service also bought 1,164 acres of well-tended forest that sits on the river \u2019 s eastern bank .\nIt was the Land and Water Conservation Fund that gave the $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which in turn , parlays the earnings from gas leases and offshore oil into recreation projects and conservation .\nTrull , who used to be a miner himself before , shared , \u201c It \u2019 s got hunting access , new trails , canoeing , kayaking , fishing , wildlife observation \u2013 all sorts of recreation opportunities for the community.\n\u201d In addition , a beaver pond is actually below the Piper mines that are now sealed since the remains of the min are contaminated by sulfuric acid and runoff that filtered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop this , a state agency has already closed up the pits and cleaned up some of the mess that was made from all these toxins .\nNow the plan is to clean up what \u2019 s left and restore it to its natural state .\nAnd with the amazing growth of the lilies , there \u2019 s hope that it won \u2019 t take

"According to a new study , the rings and tilt that the planet Saturn is best known for could have been the result of an ancient , missing moon that had a \u201c grazing encounter \u201d by smashing a moon to bits , hence forming its rings .\nThe rings of Saturn , which swirl about the planet \u2019 s equator , is what the planet is best down for .\nMoreover , it \u2019 s what makes it obvious that the planet spins on a tile .\nThis giant planet rotates at a 26.7-degree angle in relation to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s biggest energy source , the sun .\nAstronomers have suspected for many years that Saturn \u2019 s signature tilt is from gravitational interaction with Neptune , its neighboring planet , since its tilt is much like that of a spinning top that moves at the same rate as the Neptune \u2019 s orbit .\nHowever , a new modeling study from astronomers out of MIT and other school have figured out that , although these two planets were once at sync , lately , Saturn has since escaped the pull of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder , what could have caused this planetary realignment ?\nAccording to the scientists , one of their meticulously tested hypotheses is a one of Saturn \u2019 s missing moons .\nA study , which came out in the Science journal , shares how the team suggest how Saturn \u2013 which has 83 moons today \u2013 once had one more moon , which was an extra satellite named Chrysalis .\nAlongside its siblings , the research team suggests that Chrysalis once orbited Saturn for several billion years , tugging and pulling the planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , otherwise known as obliquity , in symmetry with Neptune .\nThen around 160 million years ago , the researchers claim that Chrysalis became unstable and came too close to the planet , which resulted in a grazing encounter that pulled the satellite apart .\nWith the loss of this moon , it was also enough to pull Saturn away from Neptune , leaving it with its present-day tilt .\nMoreover , the scientists believe that although most of the shattered body of Chrysalis made impact with Saturn , a portion of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then eventually breaking down into smally icy pieces , forming the planet \u2019 s beloved rings .\nAs for the missing satellite , the scientists say that they could explain two different longstanding mysteries .\nOne , is that Saturn \u2019 s present-day tilt , and two , the age of the planet \u2019 s rings , both of which were estimated to be around 100 million years old , which is much younger than the planet \u2019 s age .\nAccording to professor of planetary sciences at MIT and lead author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201c just like a butterfly \u2019 s chrysalis , this satellite was long dormant and suddenly became active , and the rings emerged.\n\u201d The study \u2019 s co-authors include Rosa Dbouk at MIT , William Hubbard at the University of Arizona , Burkhard Militzer of the University of California at Berkeley , Richard French of Wellesley College , and Francis Nimmo and Brynna Downey of the University of California at Santa Cruz .\nAs the scientists continued to study Saturn , in the early 2000s , they put an idea forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually due to the planet \u2018 being trapped in a resonance , or gravitational association , with Neptune.\n\u2019 However , a new twist on the issue came up after observations that were taken from NASA \u2019 s Cassini spacecraft between 2004 to 2017 came up .\nWhat researchers found was that Saturn \u2019 s largest satellite , Titan , was actually migrating away from Saturn at a faster clip than expected \u2013 a rate of around 11 centimeters per year .\nScientists believe that because of Titan \u2019 s quick migration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moon was more likely to be responsible for the tilting while keeping Saturn in resonance with Neptune .\nAlthough this particular explanation depends on one major unknown factor , which is Saturn \u2019 s moment of inertia or the way its mass is distributed in the planet \u2019 s interior .\nThe planet \u2019 s tile could behave differently than usually , all depending on whether the \u2018 matter is more concentrated at is core or toward the surface , \u2019 they explain .\nWisdom says , \u201c To make progress on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment of inertia of Saturn.\n\u201d In this new study , Wisdom and his colleagues thought to pin down Saturn \u2019 s moment of inertia via some of the last few observations that were taken by the Cassini in what they refer to as the \u201c Grand Finale \u201d \u2013 the phase of the mission where the spacecraft ended up making a very close approach in order to \u2018 precisely map the gravitational field around the entire planet.\n\u2019 The scientists explain that the gravitational field is used to figure out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe research team modeled the interior of Saturn , and then identified a distribution of mass that matched that of the gravitational field which Cassini observed .\nNotably , what they found was that this newly identified moment of inertia found Saturn quite close to but outside the resonance with Neptune .\nWhile the planets may have formerly been in sync , they are no longer in sync .\nWisdom explains , \u201c Then we went hunting for ways of getting Saturn out of Neptune \u2019 s resonance.\n\u201d To see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satellites in existence influenced Saturn \u2019 s tilt , the research group carried out simulations to evolve the planet \u2019 s orbital dynamics and its moons backward in time .\nBut their search came up empty .\nAs a result , the scientists reexamined the mathematical equations that describe a planet \u2019 s precession , which is actually \u2018 how a planet \u2019 s axis of rotation changes over time.\n\u2019 As for one particular term in this equation , it has contributions from all the satellites .\nAccording to the team , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was removed from this sum , it could affect the planet \u2019 s precession.\n\u2019 But the question remains , how big would that satellite have to be , and what dynamics does it need to undergo to remove Saturn from Neptune \u2019 s resonance ?\nWisdom and his colleagues ran some simulations to figure out the properties of a satellite , like its mass and orbital radius , as well as the orbital dynamics that are needed to knock Saturn out of the resonance .\nIn conclusion , they share that Saturn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the resonance with Neptune , and as for the loss of its satellite , Chrysalis , which is around the size of Iapetus \u2013 which is Saturn \u2019 s third-largest moon \u2013 is what allowed it to escape the resonance .\nIt was sometime between 200 and 100 million years ago when Chrysalis entered a chaotic orbital zone , allowing it to experience a number of close encounters with Titan and Iapetus , which eventually came to close to Saturn .\nThis was a grazing encounter that ended up ripping the satellite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraction to circle the planet as a debris-strewn ring.\n\u2019 What they found was that the loss of Chrysalis explains Saturn \u2019 s precession , as well as its present-day tile , and the late formation of its rings .\nWisdom explained in an article in MIT News , \u201c It \u2019 s a pretty good story , but like any other result , it will have to be examined by others .\nBut it seems that this lost satellite was just a chrysalis , waiting to have its instability.\n\u201d What are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share this news !", "author": "True Activist", "url":

carbon dioxide ventilators may possibly turn fumes into fertilizer in order to bring vegetable patches to high rise building rooftops .\nWhile this wasn \u2019 t just suggested , the study also included an experiment that discovered how spinach , by new air vents , managed to grow four-times bigger than the other plants in the study .\nThe scientists that conducted the study share that this

building air vents into fertilizer that improves the challenging plant-growing environments for plant-life on rooftops .\nThere are hundreds of rooftop vegetable gardens , both big and small , that

grow tend to be smaller or less healthy than others precisely because where they are situated tends to gain more solar radiation , have more wind exposure , and the soil where they are buried is usually drier than usual .\nWhat the research group decided to do was intercede by repurposing the CO2 that \u2019 s usually emitted from the exhaust of the building into a fertilizer to help the plants grow .\nAccording to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarabeth Buckley , who is now with the University of Cambridge , the team started growing corn and spinach on a Boston University campus roof , an experiment they called BIG GRO .\nShe said , \u201c We wanted to test whether there is an untapped resource inside buildings that could be used to make plants grow larger in rooftop farms .\nCreating more favorable conditions that increase growth could help make rooftop farms more successful and therefore more viable options for installation on buildings.\n\u201d The reason Dr. Buckley and the team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because these are commonly edible plants that are also more sensitive to high levels of CO2 when they photosynthesize , as compared other plants .\nThey also placed the plants closer to the exhaust vents of the building , while leaving another control near simple fans .\nIn the classrooms below , the CO2 levels were also measured regularly to find out how much extra CO2 the plants were getting .\nThey found that there were high concentrations in both the rooftop exhaust vents and inside the classrooms when people were in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , \u201c CO2 levels averaged above 1000

monitored in size , how many leaves they had , and their wet and dry biomass after they were harvested .\nThe scientists explained what was striking about the results of the experiment , which was also published in the Frontiers journal , saying that \u2018 spinach grown beside the exhaust vents had four-times the biomass of spinach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moreover , the high winds also decreased the size advantage in some of the plants , although they were still twice as big as the control plants .\nBut Dr. Buckley forewarned that more work is still needed to be done before the system can be put into place .\nShe shared , \u201c There are still many aspects of this system that must be determined before it can be implemented\u2026 \u201d she said .\n\u201c There is a decrease in growth with

environmental and social benefits such as energy savings for the building , carbon drawdown , climate mitigation , urban heat reduction , local food production , community building opportunities , and

as a marshmallow .\nNASA \u2019 s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite spotted how this planet crossed in front of its star .\nThis gave the astronomers the chance to calculate the planet \u2019 s diameter and they saw this to be around 100,000 miles ( or 150,000 kilometers ) .\nThis makes it just a tad bigger than Jupiter .\nAs the planet orbits around its host star , it only takes it just 3.5 days , and this is 25-times less than the closest planet in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As for Mercury , this needs around 88 days to do the orbiting .\nOne might assume that this might be enough to heat up and

dimmest members that is part of what they call the main-sequence stars , which are stars that steadily convert hydrogen into helium at their very cores .\nWhile this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own un , red dwarf stars can be extremely active .\nThese can erupt with powerful flares that are so strong that they have the capacity to strip the atmosphere off a planet .\nThis makes the star system a hostile location to form such a gossamer planet .\n\u201c Giant planets around red dwarf stars have traditionally been thought to be hard to form , \u201d said Shubham Kanodia .\nShe is the first author on a

answered .\nThe main question right now is how a gas-giant planet can form around a red dwarf star , and especially such a low-density planet .\nWhile this may seem baffling , Kanodia \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer to this conundrum .\nThey hypothesized that the extra-low density of TOI-3757 b could be because of two factors .\nThe first one is connected to its rocky core because gas giants are thought to start its life as massive rocky cores that are around ten times the mass of Earth .\nThis is when they are able to quickly pull in large amounts of neighboring gas to form the gas giants that we know of .\nTOI-3757b \u2019 s star doesn \u2019 t have that much abundance of heavy elements when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with gas giants .\nThis may have come about because the rocky core forms more slowly , which delays bringing about the onset of gas accretion that affects its general density .\nThe second one may be linked to the planet \u2019 s orbit , which is assumed to be slightly elliptical .\nThis means that at times , the planet gets closer to its star while sometimes , it doesn \u2019 t , which results to substantial excessive heating , something that causes its atmosphere to bloat .\n\u201c Potential future observations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NASA \u2019 s new James Webb Space Telescope could help shed light on its puffy nature , \u201d said Jessica Libby-Roberts .\nShe is the second author on the paper .\n\u201c Finding more such systems with giant planets , which were once theorized to be extremely rare around red dwarfs , is part of our goal to understand how planets
