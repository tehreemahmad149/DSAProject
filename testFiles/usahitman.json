\u2019 s trucking sector with the imposition of AB5 , and it isn \u2019 t clear what parts of the industry \u2014 if any \u2014 are ready for it .\n\u201c Most immediately , motor carriers must evaluate and adopt alternative operating models to mitigate risk if they intend to continue to do business in California \u201d was the admonition from the Benesch law firm in the wake of the Supreme Court decision in the case of California Trucking Association vs. ( state Attorney General ) Bonta .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of AB5 , the law on independent contractors that leans heavily toward classifying workers as employees rather than ICs .\n\u201c Motor carriers should immediately evaluate their California operations to determine what steps , if any , should be taken to respond to the changed backdrop for trucking \u201d was the call to action from the trucking-focused Scopelitis law firm .\nOn the other side of the divide , there was celebration , including a victory lap by Lorena Gonzalez , the former and future labor leader who successfully pushed for AB5 \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2019 .\n\u201c The fact that trucking companies will have to abide by basic labor laws in CA takes us one step closer to rebuilding the middle class that was almost deregulated out of existence , \u201d Gonzalez said in a tweet .\nIn denying a review of the appellate court decision , the Supreme Court returned the case to the 9th U.S .\nCircuit Court of Appeals .\nA 9th Circuit ruling in 2021 overturned a lower court injunction that had kept AB5 at bay from California \u2019 s trucking sector , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ define independent contractors was implemented in other parts of the economy .\nThe original injunction from the lower court was based on its conclusion that AB5 was in conflict with provisions in the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 ( F4A ) .\nAttorneys for the trucking industry were heartened when the court agreed to consider questions of state preemption of F4A , including looking at a case involving C.H .\nRobinson ( NASDAQ : CHRW ) .\nBut ultimately , the court failed to take up both the CTA and C.H @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had allowed the injunction against the law to remain in effect while the CTA pushed to have the Supreme Court hear its appeal .\nWith that denied , the stay is expected to be lifted within days and AB5 will go into effect , retroactively , to Jan. 1 , 2020 .\nThat creates the prospect of litigation or state action for past actions .\nThe implementation of AB5 throughout the California economy in 2020 came with a Swiss cheese lineup of exemptions , both in the original bill and in AB 2257 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sectors that said they had been particularly hard-hit by AB5 .\nAmong the exempted professions : doctors , dentists and hairstylists .\nAmong those exempted in the second bill : translators ( who were particularly vocal about the damage to their industry under AB5 , ) youth sports coaches and insurance inspectors .\nCritics of AB5 have held that the lengthy , seemingly random list of exemptions was evidence that AB5 was largely targeting two sectors : trucking and gig drivers such as those at Uber , Lyft and with parcel services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not come under AB5 because of voter approval of Proposition 22 on Election Day 2020 , though a court later ruled Prop 22 unconstitutional .\nThat court decision is on appeal , and a stay has allowed gig drivers protected by Prop 22 to remain outside the control of AB5 .\nAB5 is particularly problematic for the trucking sector .\nThat \u2019 s because it is based on the ABC test to define independent contractors , the B prong of which is being interpreted as a possible death knell or at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model in trucking .\nThe B test defines an independent contractor as a worker who is engaged in \u201c work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity \u2019 s business.\n\u201d A trucking company hiring an independent owner-operator to move freight is seen as likely in violation of the B prong .\nThe question now turns to what the trucking industry does specifically in response to the hard reality that AB5 has arrived on the doorstep .\nFrom the organized labor side , recommendations on how trucking companies should proceed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I was advising the trucking sector , I would be getting ready for AB5 to be the law of the land in California , and for the state to begin enforcing it , \u201d Doug Bloch , political director for Teamsters Joint Council 7 , which represents the union in Northern California and northern Nevada , told FreightWaves .\nBloch said the Teamsters \u201c recognizes there are legitimate owner-operators out there in trucking.\n\u201d But he pivoted when discussing trucking to a specific part of the trucking ecosystem : drayage drivers .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state has found misclassification to be the norm , \u201d Bloch said .\nDrayage drivers should now be \u201c looking at where I am going to end up working , \u201d he said , predicting that port companies that now utilize the services of independent drayage drivers will turn to an employee model .\n\u201c That is our goal , to have owner-operators hired as drivers , \u201d Bloch said .\n\u201c Our goal is for the shipping industry to take responsibility for these drivers.\n\u201d If the workers are converted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be easier for them to be paid an amount that reflect at least the minimum wage , and it would push the responsibility for buying new zero-emission vehicles on to the port companies , rather than on to the drivers .\n\u201c We \u2019 ll be asking fleet owners to do this , \u201d Bloch said .\nGiven the state \u2019 s focus on regulatory issues surrounding the ports , it is reasonable to think actions by California under AB5 might first arrive in the drayage industry .", "author": "mediahitman", "url":

Wolter , P.G . )\nIt appears the first eight numbers chronicled within the Kensington Rune Stone inscription are connected to the Masonic legend of Hiram Abiff ; the Grand Architect who oversaw the construction of King Solomon \u2019 s Temple , and to the Select Master degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freemasonry .\nIn nearly every Catholic Church around the world the Crucifixion and Resurrection story of Jesus is told in images called the Stations of the Cross .\nIt isn \u2019 t a coincidence the number of Stations of the Cross is 14 .\nIt appears what we now have is , 8 G\u00f6talanders ( Deity ) and 22 Northmen ( paths that connect the ten spheres ) ; \u2026 2 shelters ( Ahishar and Adoniram ) , and one day \u2019 s journey ( Zerubbabel ) .\nIf we add these numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear on the stone we get , 8 + 22 + 2 = 32 + 1 =33 .\nThose numbers sequentially , follow the Select Master ritual perfectly , AND that those numbers add up to the same total of 33 as in the Kabbalah , simply can not be a coincidence .\nA Masonic Brother reminded me about another connection to the numbers 8 and 22 that I had frankly , forgotten about .\nHere we have the number twenty-two having significance in not just ancient Egyptian mysticism , but as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on into Hebrew mysticism where we find the same numbers being symbolically important in the Kabbalah .\nThe numbers that appear on the Kensington Rune Stone imply the carver was deeply versed in symbolism , allegory , codes , and specific sacred numbers that appear to have been passed on as a continuous thread through mystical sects from ancient Egypt to the Hebrews , to the Cistercian \u2019 s/Knight Templar , and finally into Modern Freemasonry .\nThere is so much more information I decided to cut the article here and then compose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titles to properly document the different branches this investigation leads you .\nSo we can at least say that the Kensington Stone is possibly the earliest evidence of a \u2018 group \u2019 of that voyaged to America for the possible land claim of this area and that this stone was carved in an ancient text which little is still known to this day .\nA couple of tests have been completed on the stone and it provided credibility to its authenticity .\nThis mystery stone will always be a major factor in when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what our modern history books like to claim which was done by Christopher Columbus .\nThe Knights Templar was founded in 1119 and was active until about 1312 .\nThe earliest texts in 1390 mention the first Freemasons , and lastly the Illuminati was found in 1776 .\nNow many believe the Knights Templar dissolved themselves into Freemasonry when King Philip had many of the order \u2019 s members in France arrested , tortured into giving false confessions , and burned at the stake .\nWhat we can be certain that these mysterious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or event has a major significance for our secret societies of today \u2019 s elite .\nMany in these orders have no clue of the true \u2018 secrets \u2019 held within the society but you can be certain that they are keepers of hidden knowledge .", "author": "mediahitman", "url":
