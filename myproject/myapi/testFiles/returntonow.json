field for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers laughed and mocked him , but little did they know , the joke was on them .\nWhen the native grasses and their deep roots were flipped upside-down , it decomposed the soil \u2019 s organic matter faster .\nThis created a flush of nutrients available to the first round of cultivated crops , but left the soil more and more depleted each year it was tilled .\nThe Green Revolution of the following decades ( 1940s \u2013 1960s ) , allowed us to replenish the major nutrients we \u2019 d robbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting a band-aid on the problem until now .\nThe

century old farm in Bird-In-Hand Pennsylvania .\nHis heritage-breed cows are raised on organic pastures , with the chickens following behind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whey-fed pigs trampling all the fertilizer back into the ground after that .\nAround 4000 customers of his private , members-only , food buying club are dependent on his meat , eggs and dairy products , as well as fermented fruits and veggies\u2026 and are willing to spend top dollar to get it shipped to them all over the country , as they don \u2019 t trust food from the grocery store .\nBut a couple of weeks ago , a federal

assigned to his case , $ 50,000 of which was due last week as a \u201c good faith \u201d payment to avoid jail .\nSo what exactly is Miller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meat he raises on his own farm and selling it fresh-frozen to members of his private food buying club , who \u2019 ve all signed contracts stating they understand the meat is not processed in USDA-inspected plants , or treated with

too stupid to think for themselves and need them to come in and protect them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t know ( because I didn \u2019 t until Miller told me ) that all USDA-licensed processing plants are required to treat ALL meat ( even the local , grass-fed , organic variety ) with synthetic preservatives .\n\u201c Often they use citric acid , which you \u2019 d think comes from oranges or lemons , but it \u2019 s a modified substance made from corn\u2026 and they don \u2019 t even have to label it on the meat , \u201d Miller said .\n\u201c The USDA processing plants require the meat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citric acid , lactic acid and peracetic acid , \u201d said a customer who handles Miller \u2019 s website and other modern communications ( because he \u2019 s Amish ) .\n\u201c The peracetic acid is toxic and the citric and lactic are GMO.\n\u201d \u201c It \u2019 s not lactic acid coming from the fermentation of sauerkraut .\nIt \u2019 s all created in a dish in a lab .\nIt \u2019 s a synthetic

meat , with no additives .\nOur members want it straight from the farm with no preservatives on it.\n\u201d \u201c As a farmer , you could invest all your energy and money producing the most healthy , nourishing meat and at the end of the day , you are ruining your meat sending your animals to a USDA facility for slaughter , \u201d Anke added .\nAdditionally , USDA-approved processing plants aren

require preservatives and allowed the sale of organ meats , it still would still be nearly impossible for Miller and other small farmers to make a profit with Big Meat processors acting as middlemen .\nAnd the cost of becoming licensed by the USDA to process their own meat is too steep .\n\u201c The rules and regulations are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt $ 100,000 before you ever sell your first pound of meat , and the market \u2019 s not guaranteed , \u201d Miller said .\n\u201c There \u2019 s no option for farmers to start small and add on and buy equipment as they can.\n\u201d The USDA is basically telling us \u201c either get a license or go out of business .\nAnd our position is we \u2019 d rather go out of business , because their rules and regulations are too hard to follow.\n\u201d \u201c We have many small farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be farmers , but the business has gotten so monopolized.\n\u201d There should be separate regulations for large and small farms , Anke argued : \u201c There \u2019 s a big difference between processing 1000 animals a day or one per week .\nWe don \u2019 t need to track and trace every animal with an ear tag and report about each one to the USDA .\nWe slaughter one animal , distribute it among our members , and then , when the need arises , we slaughter another one .\nThat \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are healthy and thriving and never want to go back to where they came from.\n\u201d Our animals are born and raised on our own farm .\nWe have the oversight .\nWe know the mother .\nWe know the father .\nThere is no incest .\nThere is no cross-breeding .\nWhat does the USDA label on your food doing to make your food safer ?\nNothing .\nThe chickens you buy from the grocery store \u2014 especially Tyson \u2014 have a built-in obesity gene .\nSo they blow up in five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat this stuff !\nThe cows are genetically manipulated to produce 6 gallons of milk per day instead of 2.\n\u201d Miller said he hears of small farmers going out of business every week , \u201c and the past two years have been worse.\n\u201d \u201c If the government continues this harassment of small farmers , the only option is to go out of business and that will create more food shortages more than ever .\nGod has provided .\nGod has given plenty of rain .\nGod has provided plenty of grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is getting in the way of farmers being farmers .\nThey \u2019 re on the hot seat , not me\u2026 if they want to create a food shortage , we can \u2019 t blame God China and Russia have it figured out .\nThey have small farms all over .\nThey have learned their lesson the hard way that that \u2019 s the way of sustainability .\nAmerica has not figured that out yet , but they might just shortly.\n\u201d There are other small farmers who sell directly to their customers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Because Amos has the most business , \u201d Anke explained .\n\u201c People want his food .\nAll over the country.\n\u201d The way Amos is farming is the way it \u2019 s supposed to be .\nWe don \u2019 t need chemicals , we don \u2019 t need fertilizers .\nThe war in Russia has inflated fertilizer and grain prices .\nThey need fertilizer to grow food .\nWe don \u2019 t .\nOur fertilizer is the manure ( which the USDA doesn \u2019 t allow because their animals are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manure is , bar none , the best fertilizer you can have .\nAnd fuel prices ?\nAmos doesn \u2019 t use a tractor .\nHe uses horses .\nWe \u2019 re not effected by these shortages.\n\u201d Anke pointed out the hypocrisy that farmers are legally allowed to slaughter and sell water buffalo , rabbit and fish without a license : \u201c He can slaughter them in his backyard , at the front door , in his living room \u2014 it doesn \u2019 t matter \u2014 as many as he wants .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ or rabbit .\nIf it \u2019 s just about food safety , why don \u2019 t the buffalo and rabbit pose a food safety risk ?\nBecause it \u2019 s all about profit and money .\nThey want a monopoly on beef , pork and poultry .\nIt used to be in our country that you are innocent until proven guilty .\nThey have no evidence , no proof .\nWe have never been in court to debate accusations .\nThey are basically saying unless you go through federal inspection , you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s true , I should be dead , because I \u2019 m drinking raw milk , I \u2019 m eating raw eggs , I eat raw liver .\nI am thriving on this type of food and so are many of our members.\n\u201d We want to turn it around and take the USDA to court , so that we are the prosecutors , and they are the

together and let nature take over.\n\u201d \u201c We start with soil .\nWe touch , feel and even taste it to identify what properties it lacks.\n\u201d Next , his company mixes in local biomass \u2014 compost , manure , etc .\n\u2014 to help compacted soil become more porous and allow water to seep in .\n\u201c If the soil is lacking nutrients , we don \u2019 t just add nutrients directly to the

before human intervention .\nThen they decide whether they want a fruit forest , a flower forest , a forest that attracts a lot of birds or bees , or an evergreen forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layer \u2014 canopy , tree layer , sub tree layer and shrubs .\nThen , they collect the seeds , germinate the saplings , and plant them in a tight-knit pattern that intersperses the various species .\nNext , they spread a thick layer of mulch to hold in moisture during the summer and protect the soil from frost during the winter .\nThis makes for extremely soft soil , allowing roots to penetrate and grow quickly .\nWithin 3 months the roots reach one meter deep and form a mesh holding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nutrients available to the roots .\nThe forest is watered and weeded for two to three years , but as the forest grows it blocks the sunlight and weeds stop growing .\nShortly after this , the canopy becomes so dense , the forest retains every drop of water , eliminating the need for watering .\nThe

non-stick , they cook food better , cost less and literally last forever Cast iron cookware was a staple in European and American homes for 500 years ( first popularized in Asia 2000 years ago ) .\nBut in the late 1950s , Teflon-coated aluminum pans became the new craze .\nThey were lighter weight , heated up and cooled down faster , and best of all , they had some slick mystery coating on them that kept food from sticking and made cleanup easier .\nUnfortunately , like many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we \u2019 ve come to learn the nifty non-stick pans have their drawbacks .\nTeflon belongs to a highly toxic class of \u201c forever chemicals \u201d called perfluoroalkyl chemicals , or PFAs , that slowly leak into our food , especially at high temperatures .\nA recent study found the chemicals in Teflon and other non-stick cookware reduce testosterone , shrink penises , and contribute to infertility .\nWith that in mind , let \u2019 s look at the benefits of going back to good old cast iron : 1 .\nIt \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There \u2019 s nothing like the test of time to see if a product is safe and worthwhile .\nCast iron pots and pans have been used since the end of the Bronze Age (

necessary nutrient in our diets .\n3 .\nNon-stick and easy to clean\u2026 Believe it or not , as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooking oil and get it piping hot before you use it , food should not stick to it , like it does to stainless steel .\nAnd when food does stick to it , you can use steel wool on it ( unlike with Teflon ) , which gets it off no problem .\n4 .\nHandles high heat\u2026 You can put it in the oven or right over an open fire .\n5 .\nCooks evenly\u2026 Many chefs prefer cast iron because of its superior heat distribution .\n6 .\nBrowns food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot , it puts a nice crispy crust on your burgers , sausages , fried fish or broiled veggies .\n7 .\nUsable as a grill\u2026 like we said above , if your going camping or trying out primitive living in your backyard , you can stick it right over the fire , or on your stove ( with a good hood vent ) and get that nice char-broiled taste .\n8 .\nThey \u2019 re cheap\u2026 Compared to all the new fangled varieties of PFA-free , non-stick pots and pans , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for less money .\n9 .\nThey last forever\u2026 You won \u2019 t have to worry about scratching , chipping or handles breaking\u2026 cast iron is as heavy duty as it gets .\nCast iron woks in China are known to have lasted hundreds of years and are passed down from generation to generation , with their seasoning only getting better over time !\nThe only

year .\nConsidering the global population , and therefore the number of abortions , goes up each year\u2026 we \u2019 ve almost reached a billion abortions per decade .\nCan you imagine adding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten years ?\n!\nLast I did the math ( five years ago ) , we had 7.5 billion people on earth , and doubling rate , at that time , was every 60 years ( we were doubling at a rate of every 40 years when the baby boomers were being born ) .\nIf we had continued at that rate , we \u2019 d be at 15 billion by 2080 .\nI don \u2019 t know what the doubling rate is now that so many people have been stealthily sterilized via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 ve got to realize the people in charge must \u2019 ve been terrified of the chaos resulting from the impending population explosion to go to such drastic measures to covertly cull us .\nAnd their fear was warranted ( though their dishonest strategy for dealing with it was not ) .\nA math professor tried to warn us , in the 1980s , that \u201c humanity \u2019 s greatest shortcoming is our inability to understand the exponential function.\n\u201d He explains how the human population has been growing exponentially for thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and extremely rapidly since the industrial revolution , jumping from millions , just 200 years ago , to the ten-billions by the end of the century .\nEvery time you double the population , the population gets exponentially bigger\u2026 For example , it has taken less than 50 years for the population to double from 4 billion to 8 billion .\nIf the eugenicists hadn \u2019 t just sterilized billions of people , we \u2019 d be at 16 billion in another half century or so , then 32 billion by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion , then 128 billion , and so on .\nAnd that \u2019 s with nearly a billion abortions happening per decade !\nImagine if those abortions weren \u2019 t happening !\nAlmost all experts agree the population will peak at around 11 or 12 billion before we hit Earth \u2019 s carrying capacity for humans , and then population growth will naturally stop or even decline\u2026 so many think there \u2019 s nothing to worry about .\nBut how ?\n?\nHow is it going to stop or decline ?\nHere \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in one of six ways\u2026 take your pick : 1 .\nMass starvation and chaos .\nPopulation overshoot occurs when a population temporarily exceeds the long-term carrying capacity of its environment ( depletes all the natural resources ) .\nThe result is a sudden , unexpected , population collapse or die-off .\n2 .\nChild sacrifice .\nIn the dark ages , when people didn \u2019 t know how to regulate their birth rate , they would sacrifice babies and children to the \u201c gods \u201d ( throwing them over cliffs ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c For centuries , millions of European children had been passed through discreet revolving boxes set into the walls of foundling hospitals .\nThese boxes were designed to protect the anonymity of the person leaving the child , but they offered scant protection to the infant .\nThe survival rate in those institutions was little better than if the revolving boxes had opened directly into a crematorium \u2019 s furnace.\n\u201d Sex at Dawn 3 .\nForced or secret sterilization .\nIn China , they resorted to openly and forcibly sterilizing people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid options # 1 and # 2 .\nIn the rest of the world , we are now being secretly sterilized via the co vid shot .\nThere are plenty of studies showing this is the case , but the links to all of them are blocked by Faise book .\nI will save the links for a future post to avoid getting this one sensored .\n4 .\nAbortion .\nPreferably in the first 3 months , which would be more attainable if access weren \u2019 t so restricted and demonized .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t recommend this as it would make for a miserable existence .\nCultivating orgasm energy has the potential to create heaven on Earth .\n6 .\nNatural family planning and orgasm without ejaculation .\nThis is the most appealing option in my opinion .\nWe need to empower ourselves to know our bodies and natural cycles .\nWhen women are in the 5-day \u201c danger window , \u201d men need to be extra careful about pulling out .\nWhen they mature , and master ejaculation control , this becomes easier .\nWhen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn to orgasm without ejaculating at all , recycling their life-force energy toward higher purposes , and creating heaven on Earth .\nIn the meantime , there are tons of herbs women can use as an herbal morning-after pill until their period starts , which is far superior to surgical or pharmaceutical abortions ( or child sacrifice/poverty/neglect/abuse ) in my opinion : I am writing this article as someone whose mom and dad marched in anti-abortion rallies , and as someone who kept an unplanned pregnancy I was totally unprepared for because my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think abortion was NEVER an option .\nObviously , I don \u2019 t regret my daughter \u2019 s existence .\nMy entire life revolves around her , I \u2019 d die and kill for her , and I think I \u2019 m about as good a mom as they come\u2026 such a good mom that when I realized how much energy it took to meet one child \u2019 s needs , I aborted my second pregnancy when she was almost 7 .\nI would \u2019 ve loved to have had two kids , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STILL playing catch-up ,

importantly , my daughter \u2019 s .\nAnd the little psychic that she is , she knew this , crying and begging for me to \u201c get rid of it , \u201d when she found out I was pregnant .\nSo I took my normal regimen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lace , Parsley , Vitamin C and rutin , which I normally used as an herbal \u201c morning-after-pill \u201d , daily , until I started my period .\nBut this time I started the routine too late .\nIt didn \u2019 t work .\nI looked into abortion options in North Carolina , but found out I \u2019 d have to wait until the baby was 16 weeks get an ultrasound , hear the heartbeat and look at the images , before I could go through with it .\nI thought it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much about babies would make you wait until the embryo turned into something resembling a baby to kill it .\nSo I got a hold of a midwife friend of mine and got a black-market , pharmaceutical abortion pill .\nWhen I took it and the contractions began , I was terrified some fully formed little baby the size of a plumb would come out , its tiny fingers grasping for me to bring it back to life , as all the Christian websites warned would happen around 8-10 weeks weeks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my relief as I sifted through several blood clots , the largest one the size of a raspberry , and could only find an even smaller , white jelly-fish-like blob inside of it , which I couldn \u2019 t tear open .\nI put it in a jar , took a few pictures and then buried it in the garden , where I decided its energy would be recycled back into the earth to nourish the undernourished lives that were already here .\nMy daughter , her father , and I had lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and had just moved into our fifth rental house since she had been born .\nWe were Air Bnb \u2019 ing out three of the bedrooms in the house and our camper in the backyard , as it was the only way we could afford to live in a house again .\nWe \u2019 d given up on a food truck business that was far too much work for too little pay and were living on the cheap while we got this natural living blog started .\nShortly after the abortion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 d ever made on the blog .\nThat , combined with the Air Bnb money , allowed us to put our child in a wonderful private Waldorf school and start saving money rapidly with the goal of buying our own land to homestead and grow food on .\nTwo years later , ko vid and the lockdowns hit .\nLike thousands of alternative media outlets , our natural health-oriented blog was severely sensored on Faisebook ( spelling intentional ) and our income dropped to 10 % of what it was .\nWe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things were about to get weird .\nIt was time to buy as much land we could before inflation hit and we \u2019 d never have the chance again .\nWe did .\nAnd we have almost replaced our lost blog income by immediately converting an old barn into an Air Bnb , buying another cheap camper to rent out , and we are almost done building a second cabin .\nWe are now in a massive ton of debt , but still in a much more economically secure place as land owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubled times .\nThe moral of the story\u2026 if we \u2019 d had a second child , we \u2019 d probably be living in a camper with two kids right now , eating crappy food , and tempted to stick our kids in government indocrtrination camps/aka schools for free childcare .\nWe would \u2019 ve

even have to label it on the meat , \u201d Miller said .\n\u201c The USDA processing plants require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemical cocktail of citric acid , lactic acid and peracetic acid , \u201d said a customer who handles Miller \u2019 s website and other modern communications ( because he \u2019 s Amish ) .\n\u201c The peracetic acid is toxic and the citric and lactic are GMO.\n\u201d \u201c It \u2019 s not lactic acid coming from the fermentation of sauerkraut .\nIt \u2019 s all created in a dish in a lab .\nIt \u2019 s a synthetic sterilizer that causes many health problems , \u201d Anke ( who preferred not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c Our members don \u2019 t want any of that , \u201d Miller said .\n\u201c They want fresh , raw meat , with no additives .\nOur members want it straight from the farm with no preservatives on it.\n\u201d \u201c As a farmer , you could invest all your energy and money producing the most healthy , nourishing meat and at the end of the day , you are ruining your meat sending your animals to a USDA facility for slaughter , \u201d Anke added .\nAdditionally , USDA-approved processing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain organ meats and glands for human consumption .\n\u201c The very nutrient-dense organs , that seem to help people , they want to ban , \u201d Miller said .\nEven if the USDA didn \u2019 t require preservatives and allowed the sale of organ meats , it still would still be nearly impossible for Miller and other small farmers to make a profit with Big Meat processors acting as middlemen .\nAnd the cost of becoming licensed by the USDA to process their own meat is too steep .\n\u201c The rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get into debt $ 100,000 before you ever sell your first pound of meat , and the market \u2019 s not guaranteed , \u201d Miller said .\n\u201c There \u2019 s no option for farmers to start small and add on and buy equipment as they can.\n\u201d The USDA is basically telling us \u201c either get a license or go out of business .\nAnd our position is we \u2019 d rather go out of business , because their rules and regulations are too hard to follow.\n\u201d \u201c We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would love to be farmers , but the business has gotten so monopolized.\n\u201d There should be separate regulations for large and small farms , Anke argued : \u201c There \u2019 s a big difference between processing 1000 animals a day or one per week .\nWe don \u2019 t need to track and trace every animal with an ear tag and report about each one to the USDA .\nWe slaughter one animal , distribute it among our members , and then , when the need arises , we slaughter another one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOur members are healthy and thriving and never want to go back to where they came from.\n\u201d Our animals are born and raised on our own farm .\nWe have the oversight .\nWe know the mother .\nWe know the father .\nThere is no incest .\nThere is no cross-breeding .\nWhat does the USDA label on your food doing to make your food safer ?\nNothing .\nThe chickens you buy from the grocery store \u2014 especially Tyson \u2014 have a built-in obesity gene .\nSo they blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you eat this stuff !\nThe cows are genetically manipulated to produce 6 gallons of milk per day instead of 2.\n\u201d Miller said he hears of small farmers going out of business every week , \u201c and the past two years have been worse.\n\u201d \u201c If the government continues this harassment of small farmers , the only option is to go out of business and that will create more food shortages more than ever .\nGod has provided .\nGod has given plenty of rain .\nGod has provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the government is getting in the way of farmers being farmers .\nThey \u2019 re on the hot seat , not me\u2026 if they want to create a food shortage , we can \u2019 t blame God China and Russia have it figured out .\nThey have small farms all over .\nThey have learned their lesson the hard way that that \u2019 s the way of sustainability .\nAmerica has not figured that out yet , but they might just shortly.\n\u201d There are other small farmers who sell directly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amos Miller ?\n\u201c Because Amos has the most business , \u201d Anke explained .\n\u201c People want his food .\nAll over the country.\n\u201d The way Amos is farming is the way it \u2019 s supposed to be .\nWe don \u2019 t need chemicals , we don \u2019 t need fertilizers .\nThe war in Russia has inflated fertilizer and grain prices .\nThey need fertilizer to grow food .\nWe don \u2019 t .\nOur fertilizer is the manure ( which the USDA doesn \u2019 t allow because their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut our manure is , bar none , the best fertilizer you can have .\nAnd fuel prices ?\nAmos doesn \u2019 t use a tractor .\nHe uses horses .\nWe \u2019 re not effected by these shortages.\n\u201d Anke pointed out the hypocrisy that farmers are legally allowed to slaughter and sell water buffalo , rabbit and fish without a license : \u201c He can slaughter them in his backyard , at the front door , in his living room \u2014 it doesn \u2019 t matter \u2014 as many as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for water buffalo or rabbit .\nIf it \u2019 s just about food safety , why don \u2019 t the buffalo and rabbit pose a food safety risk ?\nBecause it \u2019 s all about profit and money .\nThey want a monopoly on beef , pork and poultry .\nIt used to be in our country that you are innocent until proven guilty .\nThey have no evidence , no proof .\nWe have never been in court to debate accusations .\nThey are basically saying unless you go through federal inspection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If that \u2019 s true , I should be dead , because I \u2019 m drinking raw milk , I \u2019 m eating raw eggs , I eat raw liver .\nI am thriving on this type of food and so are many of our members.\n\u201d We want to turn it around and take the USDA to court , so that we are the prosecutors , and they are the defendants .\nLet them take a sample of our meat ,

Ra\u00eblianism .\nThe UFO-worshiping religion was founded in 1973 , when a French man by the name of Claude Vorilhon , later named Ra\u00ebl , claims to have been abducted by aliens , who called themselves Elohim , who claimed to be scientists , who created humanity in a laboratory on another planet\u2026 I mean\u2026 we \u2019 ve all heard stranger stories about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Elohim apparently are trying to bring a message of peace , love and freedom ( especially sexual freedom ) to Earth , and the ONLY rule in their religion is non-violence , so to suggest their trademarked symbol is an \u201c incitement of violence \u201d is actually pretty absurd .\nAnd , what \u2019 s even weirder is Ra\u00ebl honored Elon Musk with the title of \u201c Honorary Guide of Humanity \u201d earlier this year for purchasing Twitter and \u201c promoting free speech.\n\u201d Their website also praises Musk in several articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A.I .\nand his belief in aliens .\nMusk shares the title with a strange bunch of \u201c celebrities \u201d over the years , including Bill Gates , George Soros , Mark Zuckerberg , Madonna , Michael Jackson and Sinead O \u2019 Connor .\nBut it seems now the Ra\u00eblians are upset with Musk for reneging on his promise of \u201c free-speech absolutism \u201d : \u201c While Elon Musk was made a Honorary Guide for Humanity by the Raelian Movement not too long ago for his support on freedom of speech , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the true origin and meaning of the oldest symbol on Earth , which comes from our extraterrestrial creators ,

symbol itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auspiciousness for millennia and is a religious symbol for the billions of Hindus , Buddhists , Raelians and others.\n\u201d \u201c Banning the display of our official symbol is outright religious discrimination and we hope that Mr. Musk , who claims to be a free-speech advocate , will also reactivate the post displaying our symbol .\nLet us always choose education over bans and suppression of freedom of speech.\n\u201d The Raelian philosophy states that the Jewish people are our creators \u2019 ( the Elohim ) \u201c chosen \u201d people .\nThese advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this symbol of infinity containing both the Star of David and the Swastika .\nTherefore , every real Jew should revere this symbol and not be blinded by the abuse of the swastika by the Nazis .\nIn the same vein , the use of the swastika to express antisemitism is ridiculous and outdated , and to this end , we will continue to intensify our pro-swastika rehabilitation campaigns worldwide to restore the true meaning of this \u201c fundamental \u201d symbol.\n\u201d It seems Ra\u00eblians may also regret giving the title of \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , as they have stated they are

be spending Christmas in jail after all , drops $ 300,000 fine , and allows him to sell meat again , so he doesn \u2019 t go bankrupt while a long-term solution is negotiated !\nIn what feels like a Christmas Miracle , a major food freedom case took a turn for the best .\nThe Amish typically shy away from publicity , as a part of their humble religion , but Pennsylvania farmer Amos Miller decided the USDA \u2019 s war against him and other small , organic farmers is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is prepared to take his battle all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court , if necessary .\nThe USDA ( aka Big Ag ) has been harassing Miller for years \u2013 first for his sale of raw milk , and now for his sale of truly raw meat .\nMany of us have become aware of the difference between raw , grass-fed milk straight from the farm , and the pasteurized garbage approved by the FDA\u2026 but not many of us realize that the expensive , grass-fed , \u201c raw \u201d beef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isn \u2019 t really raw .\nIf it \u2019 s USDA-approved , it \u2019 s been treated with antibiotic chemicals , which are not accurately labeled as such .\n\u201c The USDA processing plants require the meat to be treated with a chemical cocktail of citric acid , lactic acid and peracetic acid , \u201d Miller \u2019 s spokeswoman Anke Meyn told us on a phone call last April .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not citric acid from oranges or lactic acid from sauerkraut .\nIt \u2019 s all created in a lab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that causes many health problems.\n\u201d Ironically , because Miller does NOT use antibacterial chemicals to sterilize his meat , the USDA considers it \u201c adulterated , \u201d and convinced a federal judge to force him stop selling it several months ago .\nThe judge also sentenced him to jail for \u201c contempt of court , \u201d starting December 16 , and was going to shut down his farm if he did not immediately pay over $ 300,000 in fines .\nBut thanks to mainstream media coverage ( shortly after we picked

Christmas in jail and is no longer facing imminent bankruptcy , \u201d said his attorney , Robert Barnes , in a video interview .\nBarnes also negotiated away a $ 300,000 judgement that was due immediately , leaving $ 55,000 in fines due over the next six months .\nMiller \u2019 s \u201c contempt of court \u201d hearing has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in stay and abeyance , Barnes convinced the court to allow Miller to sell meat that \u2019 s been locked up in his freezers in the meantime , \u201c so his farm can survive economically while a longer-term solution is negotiated.\n\u201d \u201c The long-term solution is to enact a \u2018 custom exception plan \u2019 that allows people to get the food they want , and farmers to make it the way they want , without the government overseeing it.\n\u201d \u201c Here you have a case of people saying \u2018 I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the USDA wants it , \u2019 and \u2018 they \u2019 re saying nope , you can \u2019 t have it that way , ' \u201d Barnes
