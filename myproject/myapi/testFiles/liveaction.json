one of the nation \u2019 s leading human rights organizations , released undercover footage from The Washington-Surgi Abortion Clinic , that shows a nurse saying a patient is required to take Xanax before speaking with the abortionist , admitting that they do not use digoxin ( a lethal injection given to the infant in utero during an abortion to ensure the baby is not born alive during the procedure ) , and indicating that the patient may deliver her dead child in her hotel room alone .\n\u201c The undercover footage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abortion facility is forcing mothers to take

violence .\nTragically , this footage also shows the nurse relaying the reality that the patient may be left to deliver her dead child alone in her hotel room.\n\u201d In the video , Live Action

do that here .\nPatient : Okay .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nurse : Yeah .\nShe \u2019 ll be alive when you go to sleep , but she will definitely have passed before he does anything .\nThis same abortionist has been under scrutiny in recent months due to photos released of the mangled bodies of infant children who were killed at his facility .\nIn April , five children , some of whom medical experts say may have been able to survive outside the womb , were discovered by pro-life activists .\nNearly a dozen physicians have looked at photos and videos of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following : One intact baby boy may have been nearly full-term , and possibly a victim of infanticide .\nOne baby girl , between 28-30 weeks , had injuries consistent with an illegal partial-birth abortion \u2013\u2013 her neck is cut and her brain removed .\nAnother child , still in her gestational sac , may have been born alive and then left to die .\nThe last two children , a boy , and a girl , approximately 22 weeks and 28 weeks old respectively , were savagely dismembered and were likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dilation and Evacuation ) abortions .\nPatient : This is the possibility of labor , basically ?\nNurse : You may go into premature labor and deliver the fetus in your hotel .\nPatient : Right .\nWhat do you tell me to do when that happens ?\nNurse : That depends on what happens .\nPatient : Do you guys come and like\u2013 Nurse : He could come and help you take care of it .\nWe could just tell you what to do with the remains .\nIt just depends on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This footage also shows the unethical and coerced administration of Xanax prior to seeing the abortionists .\nXanax is a substance that medical experts attest impairs a patient \u2019 s ability to give truly informed consent , particularly when a patient is not used to taking the drug.\n\u201d Patient : No , not the fetus , just my clarity of thinking .\nNurse : It shouldn \u2019 t .\nI mean , you might be a little sleepy , but other

American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists ( AAPLOG ) said , \u201c Xanax is a substance that , in a patient who is not used to taking it , would most definitely impair her judgment and therefore her ability to give truly informed consent .\nThere is no reason a medication like this should be routinely given to a patient prior to her meeting with a physician and going through the consent process .\nOften times patients are not allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 24 hours after even minor procedures due to sedating medications they have received that impair their competence to make complex decisions .\nXanax is a clear sedative , especially in a patient na\u00efve to that medication.\n\u201d Dr. C. Ben Mitchell , ethicist and former Graves Chair of Moral Philosophy at Union University also reviewed the video footage .\n\u201c The footage I viewed indicates a likely ethical violation and could warrant further inquiry due to it demonstrating that patients were required to ingest Xanax before a full medical consultation could occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibilities and professional duties to the patient to inform , treat , and care .\nThe physician himself or herself is ultimately responsible to ensure informed consent , in which the patient understands the diagnosis , treatment options , potential outcomes , and possible complications of a procedure or medication .\nThat means being available to the patient to answer any questions the patient has about his or her care .\nFailure to do so is a dereliction of duty.\n\u201d Rose concluded , \u201c The government of DC including the Mayor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must investigate Santangelo and his facility .\nThey are not only killing children through abortion , but they may be committing illegal infanticide , as well as other federal crimes such as partial-birth abortion .\nWe demand justice for these babies , and the closure of DC \u2019 s House of Horrors , the Washington Surgi-Clinic.\n\u201d About Lila Rose & Live Action \u2013 Lila Rose founded and serves as president of Live Action .\nLive Action is a 501 ( c ) 3 human rights non-profit and the digital leader of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today to shift public opinion on abortion and defend the rights of the most vulnerable .\nWith over 5.6 million social media followers and 1.4 billion lifetime video views , Live Action reaches up to 100 million people per month \u2013 saving lives and transforming hearts , with 38 % of surveyed followers saying Live Action \u2019 s content has changed their position on abortion .\nThrough compelling educational media , human interest storytelling , investigative reporting and community activism , Live Action reveals the humanity of the preborn and exposes the abortion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nLila is also the author of \u2018 Fighting for Life : Becoming a Force for Change in a Wounded World .\nFind Lila on Twitter at @ lilagracerose , and Instagram at @ lilaroseofficial , and Facebook at @ lilagracerose .\nFind out more at http : //www.liveaction.org .", "author": "Jacob Airey", "url": "https://www.liveaction.org/undercover-investigation-prompts-serious-complaints-against-dc-abortion-facility/", "published": "Thu, 23 Jun 2022 14:47:51 +0000", "published_utc": 1656010071, "collection_utc": 1656024324}, {"id": "liveaction--2022-06-24--Historic SCOTUS Decision Reverses Roe, Ends Forced Abortion Nationwide", "date": "2022-06-24", "source": "liveaction", "title": "Historic SCOTUS Decision Reverses Roe, Ends Forced Abortion Nationwide", "content": "Live Action is just Getting Started as Nation Recovers from Killing 63 Million Babies .\nWashington , D.C. \u2013 This morning , the Supreme Court released their opinion in Dobbs v.
