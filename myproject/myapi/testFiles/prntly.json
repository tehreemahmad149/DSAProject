beautiful country geographically , and it has rich history .\nBut unfortunately its not a place I \u2019 d go back to .\nThe country is a perfect example of the disasters of communism .\nThe best analogy to describe it is that its like a case of all the patients taking over an insane asylum , and everyone who knew how to run the hospital left a long time ago .\nThe country is falling apart , literally .\nBeautiful buildings are collapsing everywhere , internet and wifi are nonexistent ( you can go to almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least wifi .\nCuba is the exception ) , and people live in extreme poverty .\nBecause capitalism is banned , there \u2019 s no incentive or ability to do anything productive to even to fix these problems .\nYou can \u2019 t hire a mason to fix a crumbling building for example , or go to a hardware store to get paint to rehab a house .\nSo the country suffers from over a half century of rot .\nAlso , the food is sadly terrible .\nIf you want real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to miami .\nPork and fresh seafood are a luxury few and far between can afford here .\nShow pictures of cuban food in America to cubans in Cuba , and they are shocked and left salivating .\nThey \u2019 re too poor to even eat the way cuban americans eat .\nThe only obese people you will see are the taxi drivers who grow fat from scamming tourists , or those in the high echelons communist party apparatus , Cuba \u2019 s only legal political party .\nOnly in a communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malnutrition on a tropical island .\nThe effects of ppl fleeing this country for 70 years straight is also very obvious .\nYou wont see young ppl in havana ; they have all left for florida ( cuba \u2019 s population is 11 million , but there \u2019 s 3 million cuban americans in the United States alone , and many others elsewhere around the world ) .\nAnd yet , you see no very old ppl here either .\nI think we saw 5 people you \u2019 d consider over 80 our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in far off retirement homes provided by the famous cuban free healthcare , but it \u2019 s doubtful .\nThe talking points that say cuba has a higher life expectancy than the US is thrown around often , but after viewing the sanitation and poverty here , and malnutrition , i feel this is a lie based on skewed numbers by the cuban regime , and American media journalists not questioning the official data due to a decades long romanticism of Communist Cuba .\nLocals seem nice , but you wont hang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s illegal for a local to give a foreigner a ride , invite a foreigner into their home unless they have a special permit , or engage in any type of relationship of any means with a foreigner unless approved by the government .\nEven relationships , friendship or otherwise , are controlled by the government .\nThe country is said to be very safe by latin american standards , and that you rarely see police , and this part is true .\nYou can and will walk through some of the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you .\nBut its not for the reasons people would think .\nThe communist regime has undercover police everywhere , as well as citizens spying on their neighbors , and if any tourist is hurt , they will face a brisk and agonizing imprisonment in one of cuba \u2019 s many , many prisons ( there \u2019 s over 200 on the island for a population of 11 mil .\nCompare this to around 40 in New York State , a high crime state with a population of over 18 million ) .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accusation of a crime committed , will not only see the accused sent to the brutal cuban prison system , where torture or sick degradation of every kind is committed , but their family can also be arrested , punishing everyone .\nIn a culture where family is so important , this alone keeps the impoverished masses in line .\nSo ppl stay impoverished , unable to even resort to crime to try and get ahead .\nIts an island of dispair .\nThe ppl are so poor in fact , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enjoy famed cuban cigars at .\nThere are no cafes or bars with well dressed cubans hanging out in panama hats and playing dominos , smoking Cohibas .\nThose days were probably a thing once upon a time , just as couples once strolled through New York \u2019 s central parks in suits and hats , the lady in a dress and carrying an umbrella in hand .\nBut like this Central Park analogy , these days in Havana are long gone .\nIn fact , It took 5 days to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theres no cigar lounges to purchase them .\nThe \u201c real \u201d cigar we bought was so bad , we figured it was a counterfeit .\nThe only good cigar we smoked was just once , given to us by an agrarian tobacco farmer in the very rural cuban countryside , a symbolic demonstration of a Cuba of a bygone era .\nIn a country where doctors make $ 50 a month , something like a cigar is a luxury the average cuban just doesn \u2019 t seem to enjoy much anymore .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ he shut down all the capitalist cigar factories .\nFactories exploiting workers was bad , and it couldn \u2019 t be allowed .\nBut this presented a unique problem , because castro loved cigars ; he is famed for being photographed constantly with them .\nSo he permitted just one cigar factory to operate : the maker of the famous Cohiba brand cigars .\nThe only problem though ?\nThese official cigars are worth months of salary for an average cuban , and the cigars are mainly used as a cash cow export @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which more resembled a gangster dictatorship than any type of government ( when castro died it was estimated that his net worth was $ 900 million .\nHe was famously filmed in luxury clothing during his final years , and enjoyed yachts , mansions and cars worth the monthly salaries of 10,000 cubans .\nJust look up pictures of him in his last interviews , wearing his expensive watches and track shoots and limited edition addidas shoes for outfits . )\nPpl like to also cite cuba \u2019 s 100 % literacy rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuba .\nBut i found this to also be BS .\nThe one time we were able to access wifi , via booking one of the few \u201c luxury \u201d hotels allowed in the city of Havana , we could finally access Google translate to talk with some ppl .\nBut when we tried showing spanish to the cuban hotel security guard when he was trying to talk to us , he couldn \u2019 t read it or write a msg because he was illiterate .\nSo I \u2019 m not sure what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but 100 % is also a lie propogated by the Cuban Regime , regurgitated by a willfully blind American fake news media .\nWe unfortunately didn \u2019 t have firsthand experience with cuban healthcare , but when locals were asked about it , none had nice things to say .\nWhen somebody asked a waiter how he liked having his free healthcare , he said it was awful .\nYou can \u2019 t complain when its free , were his words .\nAnother cuban waitress said something similar .\nLook at pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the dictator of the country many Cuban communist supporters love to talk about disparagingly .\nThey say that cuba became better off after Battista .\nAnd that inspite of all of Cuba \u2019 s problems , at least they don \u2019 t have Battista .\nBut compared to Cuba today , battista \u2019 s regime looks like a utopia .\nThe city had an academia class , it had social structures , and it had wealth .\nIt had high paying jobs in Havana for those able to compete for them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed in the most modern fasions , and drove the newest cars .\nCuba \u2019 s famed \u201c old cars \u201d that fill the city were top of the line in the Battista era , and if anything , are a testament to the wealth of many classes of Cuba in the country .\nSure there was extreme agrarian poverty in large parts of the country during battista , but there was also a middle and upper class , and a market economy where ppl could make money or a living .\nNow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst elements of the battista regime , from secret police and torture of dissidents , to all the same , or even worse , extreme poverty that the citizens live in .\nAt least in the Battista era , a person from the most impoverished segment of society could take a shot and working in the many rich segments of Havana society , and pull themselves out of poverty .\nNow they \u2019 re just stuck there , their only chance of a decent life to try and get across the sea to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuba is so bad , it exceeded any poverty ive seen in all the 48 countries I \u2019 ve visited , worse than the refugee slums of Lebanon and Iraq , to war-torn Ukraine , to Bogota , Colombia .\nAnybody who had any type of money or talent in Cuba left a long time ago .\nOn one last note , it \u2019 s often used by communist sympathizers in cuba \u2019 s defense the argument that the US Embargo , a set of laws that prevent AMERICAN companies and people from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Castro illegally seized all american owned property in the country without compensation , is the cause of cuba \u2019 s despair .\nBut consider this : there are over 180 countries in the world .\nCuba is allowed to trade with every one of them , including the nations of Europe , Asia , Africa etc , and everywhere in North America , save for the United States .\nIf cuba \u2019 s system is so bad , that it needs to rely on trade with the US to even develop at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system that they have ?\nThe best sentence to end the description of cuba with , a country where people are imprisoned for an actual law called \u201c pre criminal prevention \u201d which means you \u2019 re arrested before you commit a crime because police think you will one day commit a crime , and where there are people who are serving 7 year jail sentences for stealing half a dozen mangos from one of the communist controlled farm collectives because they \u2019 re hungry , is this : whoever the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget to hit the lights on their way out .", "author": "Prntly Editorial Board", "url":
