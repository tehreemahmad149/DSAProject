influence between Russia and the West .\nOne of the most frequently asked questions about U.S.-Russian relations over the last few years has been \u201c have we hit rock bottom ?\n\u201d .\nNo matter how bad things seem , about every six months a few Congressmen with questionable motivations come up with a new pack of sanctions or other threats to make the situation get just a bit worse .\nAfter many years of this it seems as though there is always room for relations to somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are in .\nHowever , Washington may have run out of ideas and threats as both sides of Cold War 2.0 are set to meet around January 10th right after the holiday season in Russia officially ends to build a solid mutually approved deal so that hopefully U.S.-Russian relations can finally be exposed to daylight again .\nImage : Comically bad relations between nuclear powers are still a great danger even after the Cold War .\nFrom a Russian standpoint there is finally some cause for optimism due to the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet Washington , understanding it , has still agreed to discuss it .\nAlthough American diplomats and politicians ( like those in many countries ) are very skilled at nodding their heads for a couple hours then just doing whatever the hell the want to give the illusion of sticking out an olive branch , this time the Russian position is so clear cut that if it were completely off the table Washington wouldn \u2019 t even bother participating .\nThey would be more likely to throw a PR hissyfit via the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Y , and Z , than listen to a position they find revolting for hours of negotiations .\nEssentially , the American side at least humoring Russia \u2019 s demands is a positive step for sure .\nUltimately the Russians want a Multipolar World Order in which they are one of the poles , for Washington this has been an absolutely unacceptable vision that is directly opposed to their Monopolar/Pax Americana .\nSmall-minded clowns can say the problems between Russia and America are cultural misunderstandings or rooted in buzzwords like \u201c Human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooted in these two competing visions for the Geopolitical layout of the 21st century .\nBased on this desire to have a Multipolar World and avoid a WWIII scenario in the process , this is why the Russians have now issued their hardline stance of \u201c no more NATO expansion \u201d .\nAccording to this article by RT , the overall demand from Moscow is as follows\u2026 \u201c The talks , due to be held on January 10 , will focus on two publicly released draft treaties that include a list of promises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and NATO .\nAs well as pledges that the bloc won \u2019 t expand eastwards , the proposals also include the end of Western cooperation with post-Soviet countries , the removal of US nuclear weapons from Europe , and the withdrawal of NATO troops and missiles away from the Russian border.\n\u201d Reading between the lines we can see that what Moscow is really asking for is to redraw the borders of influence between Russia and the West , which in the context of a Monopolar World is essentially demanding for it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington at the very least agrees to the death of NATO expansion , and certainly if it stops supporting puppet regimes on former Soviet territory , then January 2022 will be the official birth month of a Multipolar World .\nIt will be a great opportunity for the producers of collectable coins and stamps to cash in for sure .\nImage : The situation will change radically and instantly in Ukraine if Washington agrees to give up on it .\nPerhaps you see in these words naive optimism coming from an American deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from having better relations between these great nations .\nWhen Biden came into office during that strange election cycle most experts expected a resurgence of the America of old , coming out guns blazing from a foreign policy standpoint .\nThe brief anomaly that was Trump \u2019 s four-year term with no new wars was surely going to end .\nBut the Biden period has seen the sloppy retreat from Afghanistan , and the shift from fighting the \u201c Global War on Terror \u201d to dealing with Russia and China \u2013 essentially what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Russia \u201d part .\nThe Global War on Terror which really defined the essence of the Pax Americana period has just up and vanished and this is not by chance or to woo the Russkies into a false sense of security .\nBiden unblocking Nord Stream 2 to get the Russians to talk was a sign of weakness never before shown .\nThe fact that the American side has read Russia \u2019 s demands for NATO expansion and influence on their former territory and not laughed , but agreed to discuss it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were supposed to lock Russia into two new \u201c Vietnam \u201d scenarios , the former turning out to be a relatively cheap victory for Moscow with Damascus doing the hard fighting and the latter never truly getting off the ground .\nThe various sanctions packages were so incremental that they actually gave the Capitalist ( or State-Capitalist ) Russian economy plenty of time to adapt and thrive under them .\nNow there seems to be nothing left but to threaten ( again ) to boot Russia from SWIFT , but even that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s Washington .\nThings have become much different .\nAs you can see the \u201c Russia Question \u201d is much more difficult when the goofiness of a Khruschev-style Communist system is removed , America is in decline and Washington may be very willing to just \u201c give the damn Russians \u201d control over their traditional 1/7 of the world \u2019 s surface and be done with it .\nThe Russians , despite what CNN will tell you , have become ideologically inwardly focused and are not on the same mission of \u201c Internationalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moscow will be happy to have its Soviet borders essentially restored , and have NATO \u2019 s goodies and America \u2019 s nukes pushed back from their new fancy sphere of influence .\nAt this point both sides would benefit from redrawing the map , meaning that it is very possible , and things in our world which have changed so much recently will yet again go through a restructuring process .\nJanuary 2022 will be a very big month for Geopolitics .", "author": "Guest Author", "url":

Javelin anti-tank missiles & howitzer large caliber artillery deliveries to Ukraine . )\nIt \u2019 s time to bring \u201c NATO \u2019 s Three Chihuahuas \u201d back to front & center .\nOriginal article ( info-satire ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to boil : Small Dog Syndrome or \u2018 Yappy Dogs With a Death Wish.\n\u2019 Did you know if you get up close , face to face , with the Chihuahua in the window of a car in the parking lot , the miniature dog will become so insane with wishing to terrify you , he \u2019 ll involuntarily urinate on the door inside the car ?\nThat must be what Putin is doing to our Chihuahuas Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania : NATO \u2019 s three Chihuahuas , Lithuania , Latvia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a serious case of what \u2019 s called \u2018 small dog syndrome \u2019 Small dog .\nBig mouth .\nAre our blustery , pint-sized pooches the product of nature , nurture , or a bit of both ?\nPerhaps it \u2019 s a genetically ingrained Napoleon complex .\nOr could it be that our pooch has developed Small Dog Syndrome as a result of social experiences and parenting ?\nOr , perhaps the better question to ask , is this on account of negative social experiences & parenting ?\nOur three Chihuahuas probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of both .\nTo begin our analysis , it should be pointed out our three Chihuahuas , that is Lithuania , Latvia & Estonia , were all provinces of Russia to 1918 , when the world \u2019 s map had been redrawn on account of World War One .\nBriefly independent , the Soviet Union grabbed them back about the time Josef Stalin became ( with good cause ) paranoid of NAZI Germany .\nHe wanted to put a buffer between the Germans and St Petersberg ( a.k.a .\nPetrograd & Leningrad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on the changes in our rapidly disintegrating geopolitic . )\nMeanwhile , NAZI Germany grabbed the three Chihuahuas from the Soviet Union with the design to make them into a part of \u2018 NeueOstLand.\n\u2019 The Soviet Union grabbed the Chihuahuas back at the conclusion of the war and then , the Chihuahuas were set free again , when it was Russians had dismantled the Soviet Union .\nNow , it stands to reason the three Chihuahuas would not have enjoyed what the Soviet Union became under Stalin , but the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 d dismantled that empire , something the Russian writer Solzhenitsyn had established beyond a doubt .\nAnd somehow , possibly because the Chihuahua breed has a skull configuration appearing as though its brain had collapsed from inbreeding , our three Chihuahuas can not seem to separate out the fact Stalin was a Georgian in their paranoia of Russians and the fact it was Russians had freed them .\n\u201c Vilnius : Lithuania on Thursday accused Russia of a military \u201c invasion \u201d of conflict-torn Ukraine and called for a United Nations Security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lithuania strongly condemns the obvious invasion of the territory of Ukraine by the armed forces of the Russian Federation , \u201d the foreign ministry said , adding that the Security Council should address the matter \u201c immediately \u201d \u201d Never mind the CIA , with the complicity of the political party providing the current German chancellor , overthrew an elected government in Ukraine and has supported a post-coup neo-nazi regime in Kiev .\n\u201c one of the \u201c heroes \u201d of the marchers whose portrait appeared on a large banner was Juozas Ambrazevicius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lithuanian government of June 1941 , which fully supported the Third Reich [ \u2026 ] in May 2012 , his remains were brought back to Lithuania and buried in Kaunas with full national honors , despite his despicable role in Holocaust crimes \u201d \u201c These sanctions will not be catastrophic for the Latvian economy , \u201d Straujuma said , adding that behind the scenes \u201c Latvia has been working hard to ensure the gas sector is not affected \u201d as Latvia is almost totally reliant on Russia for supplies of natural gas \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proverb \u2018 Don \u2019 t bite the hand that feeds you \u2019 got lost in translation , or was just lost .\nNotice the dent in the skull of the Chihuahua , indicating collapse where the brain should have been .\nA physiological trait the Latvian government appears to share with Nazis : \u201c Four Latvian MPs ( E. Cilinskis , J. Dombrava , R. Dzintars , I. Par\u0101dnieks ) attended the Waffen SS fest giving it , in 2014 , a flavor of state approval taken in tandem with the gifting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Screenshot of the Latvian National-Socialist Party glorifying this annual festival ( now deleted ) at youtube : \u201c Russia has been destabilising Ukraine for too long .\nBy now , terrorists acting in Eastern Ukraine have received added reinforcements in the form of Russian military forces that can clearly be recognised .\nThis is undeclared war \u201d Sure , it actually is undeclared war , a war began by NATO and the EU undermining Ukraine , empowering neo-nazis , while crapping on its promise to Russia not to expand NATO when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd speaking of terrorists in Eastern Ukraine , what do you suppose that might have to do with the coup supporters murdering people en mass on multiple occasions ?\nOne of those occasions is spoken to by the Estonian foreign minister , captured in a phone call : Now , why do you suppose the Estonian didn \u2019 t go public with this ?\nBecause the Estonian government also harbors Nazi sentiment ?\n\u201d It is really surprising that Estonia has so hysterical reactions in their need [ to ] support the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about two weeks ago about these celebrations .\nAnd now SS-Waffen celebrations are carried out again in Estonia , but Estonia \u2019 s security service wrote the prohibition against me to enter the country .\nEstonia limits the freedom of journalists to report about the political phenomena , if these journalists don \u2019 t work under the service of Estonian security service and their ideology .\n\u201d I had a plan to enter to Estonia and write a RT-column about these SS-Waffen celebrations , feelings , symbols , etc .\nI haven \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or in other country ) , I am an EU-citizen .\nFortunately , I had planned to travel separately from Finnish friends of mine .\nIf did I travel with them on board , now I would sit in a prison cell , together with Dr. Johan B\u00e4ckman .\n\u201d Johan B\u00e4ckman , an adjunct professor at the Helsinki university , was arrested during last night 30th July although his name was not on any \u201c blacklist \u201d .\nB\u00e4ckman has never done any crime in Estonia .\nHe would have written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Petri Krohn , the president of the association Finland without Nazism has also an entry ban for the days of SS-celebrations.\n\u201d Now , we \u2019 ve established the three Chihuahuas have some common traits , collapsed heads where brain cavity should have existed , related Nazi sympathies & associations , and not least , Small Dog Syndrome , in lay terms known as \u2018 Yappy Dogs with a Death Wish \u2019 Small Dog Syndrome develops when an owner \u201c protects \u201d their dog from the world .\nThey may not allow their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in size for fear they will be hurt .\nInstead of allowing the dog to play , they sit with him in their lap or race in and swoop up the pup each time a bigger dog comes near .\nBy doing so , they deprive their dog of important socialization with his surroundings and other dogs , creating an aggressive dog that is unsure , fearful , and anxious .\nHuh .\nSounds like NATO has been an irresponsible parent , protecting our three Chihuahuas from Russia and reality .\nBut you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sympathetic relations towards & support for Nazis in Kiev , considering Russia \u2019 s history , could get small dogs penalty-kicked like a football at the poorly defended NATO goal .\nBut hey , with a depression where a brain cavity should

and Demand Immediate Stop to All Vaccinations", "content": "By Dr. Roxana Bruno , Dr. Peter McCullough , and et al .\nA group of 57 leading scientists , doctors and policy experts has released a report calling in to question the safety and efficacy of the current COVID-19 vaccines and are now calling for an immediate end to all vaccine programs .\nWe urge you to read and share this damning report .\nThere are two certainties regarding the global distribution of Covid-19 vaccines .\nThe first is that governments and the vast majority of the mainstream media are pushing with all their might to get these experimental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe second is that those who are willing to face the scorn that comes with asking serious questions about vaccines are critical players in our ongoing effort to spread the truth .\nYou can read an advanced copy of this manuscript in preprint below .\nIt has been prepared by nearly five dozen highly respected doctors , scientists , and public policy experts from across the globe to be urgently sent to world leaders as well as all who are associated with the production and distribution of the various Covid-19 vaccines in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many unanswered questions regarding the Covid-19 vaccines \u2019 safety , efficacy , and necessity .\nThis study is a bombshell that should be heard by everyone , regardless of their views on vaccines .\nThere aren \u2019 t nearly enough citizens who are asking questions .\nMost people simply follow the orders of world governments , as if they have earned our complete trust .\nThey haven \u2019 t done so .\nThis manuscript is a step forward in terms of accountability and the free flow of information on this crucial subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and share it widely .\nSARS-CoV-2 mass vaccination : Urgent questions on vaccine safety that demand answers from international health agencies , regulatory authorities , governments and vaccine developers Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak , the race for testing new platforms designed to confer immunity against SARS-CoV-2 , has been rampant and unprecedented , leading to emergency authorization of various vaccines .\nDespite progress on early multidrug therapy for COVID-19 patients , the current mandate is to immunize the world population as quickly as possible .\nThe lack of thorough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and authorization based on safety data generated during trials that lasted less than 3.5 months , raise questions regarding the safety of these vaccines .\nThe recently identified role of SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein Spike for inducing endothelial damage characteristic of COVID-19 , even in absence of infection , is extremely relevant given that most of the authorized vaccines induce the production of Spike glycoprotein in the recipients .\nGiven the high rate of occurrence of adverse effects , and the wide range of types of adverse effects that have been reported to date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine-driven disease enhancement , Th2-immunopathology , autoimmunity , and immune evasion , there is a need for a better understanding of the benefits and risks of mass vaccination , particularly in the groups that were excluded in the clinical trials .\nDespite calls for caution , the risks of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination have been minimized or ignored by health organizations and government authorities .\nWe appeal to the need for a pluralistic dialogue in the context of health policies , emphasizing critical questions that require urgent answers if we wish to avoid a global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public health .\nSince COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March 2020 , over 150 million cases and 3 million deaths have been reported worldwide .\nDespite progress on early ambulatory , multidrug-therapy for high-risk patients , resulting in 85 % reductions in COVID-19 hospitalization and death [ 1 ] , the current paradigm for control is mass-vaccination .\nWhile we recognize the effort involved in development , production and emergency authorization of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines , we are concerned that risks have been minimized or ignored by health organizations and government authorities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nVaccines for other coronaviruses have never been approved for humans , and data generated in the development of coronavirus vaccines designed to elicit neutralizing antibodies show that they may worsen COVID-19 disease via antibody-dependent enhancement ( ADE ) and Th2 immunopathology , regardless of the vaccine platform and delivery method [ 9-11 ] .\nVaccine-driven disease enhancement in animals vaccinated against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is known to occur following viral challenge , and has been attributed to immune complexes and Fc-mediated viral capture by macrophages , which augment T-cell activation and inflammation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vaccine immunologists and coronavirus experts assessed SARS-CoV-2 vaccine risks based on SARS-CoV-vaccine trials in animal models .\nThe expert group concluded that ADE and immunopathology were a real concern , but stated that their risk was insufficient to delay clinical trials , although continued monitoring would be necessary [ 14 ] .\nWhile there is no clear evidence of the occurrence of ADE and vaccine-related immunopathology in volunteers immunized with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines [ 15 ] , safety trials to date have not specifically addressed these serious adverse effects ( SAE ) .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ not exceed 2-3.5 months after the second dose [ 16-19 ] , it is unlikely such SAE would have been observed .\nDespite92 errors in reporting , it can not be ignored that even accounting for the number of vaccines administered , according to the US Vaccine Adverse Effect Reporting System ( VAERS ) , the number of deaths per million vaccine doses administered has increased more than 10-fold .\nWe believe there is an urgent need for open scientific dialogue on vaccine safety in the context of large-scale immunization .\nIn this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risks of mass vaccination in the context of phase 3 trial exclusion criteria and discuss the SAE reported in national and regional adverse effect registration systems .\nWe highlight unanswered questions and draw attention to the need for a more cautious approach to mass vaccination .\nWith few exceptions , SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trials excluded the elderly [ 16-19 ] , making it impossible to identify the occurrence of post-vaccination eosinophilia and enhanced inflammation in elderly people .\nStudies of SARS-CoV vaccines showed that immunized elderly mice were at particularly high risk of life-threatening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this evidence and the extremely limited data on safety and efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the elderly , mass-vaccination campaigns have focused on this age group from the start .\nMost trials also excluded pregnant and lactating volunteers , as well as those with chronic and serious conditions such as tuberculosis , hepatitis C , autoimmunity , coagulopathies , cancer , and immune suppression [ 16-29 ] , although these recipients are now being offered the vaccine under the premise of safety .\nAnother criterion for exclusion from nearly all trials was prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it denied the opportunity of obtaining extremely relevant information concerning post-vaccination ADE in people that already have anti-SARS-Cov-2 antibodies .\nTo the best of our knowledge , ADE is not being monitored systematically for any age or medical condition group currently being administered the vaccine .\nMoreover , despite a substantial proportion of the population already having antibodies [ 21 ] , tests to determine SARS-CoV-2-antibody status prior to administration of the vaccine are not conducted routinely .\nWill serious adverse effects from the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines go unnoticed ?\nCOVID-19 encompasses a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mild to severe pulmonary pathology and fatal multi-organ disease with inflammatory , cardiovascular , and blood coagulation dysregulation [ 22-24 ] .\nIn this sense , cases of vaccine-related ADE or immunopathology would be clinically-indistinguishable from severe COVID-19 [ 25 ] .\nFurthermore , even in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 virus , Spike glycoprotein alone causes endothelial damage and hypertension in vitro and in vivo in Syrian hamsters by down-regulating angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) and impairing mitochondrial function [ 26 ] .\nAlthough these findings need to be confirmed in humans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staggering , as all vaccines authorized for emergency use are based on the delivery or induction of Spike glycoprotein synthesis .\nIn the case of mRNA vaccines and adenovirus-vectorized vaccines , not a single study has examined the duration of Spike production in humans following vaccination .\nUnder the cautionary principle , it is parsimonious to consider vaccine-induced Spike synthesis could cause clinical signs of severe COVID-19 , and erroneously be counted as new cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections .\nIf so , the true adverse effects of the current global vaccination strategy may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this question .\nThere is already non-causal evidence of temporary or sustained increases138 in COVID-19 deaths following vaccination in some countries ( Fig .\n1 ) and in light of Spike \u2019 s pathogenicity , these deaths must be studied in depth to determine whether they are related to vaccination .\nAnother critical issue to consider given the global scale of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is autoimmunity .\nSARS-CoV-2 has numerous immunogenic proteins , and all but one of its immunogenic epitopes have similarities to human proteins [ 27 ] .\nThese may act as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autoimmunity [ 28 ] .\nWhile it is true that the same effects could be observed during natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 , vaccination is intended for most of the world population , while it is estimated that only 10 % of the world population has been infected by SARS-CoV-2 , according to Dr. Michael Ryan , head of emergencies at the World Health Organization .\nWe have been unable to find evidence that any of the currently authorized vaccines screened and excluded homologous immunogenic epitopes to avoid potential autoimmunity due to pathogenic priming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disorders , have already been reported in healthy and young vaccinated people .\nThese cases led to the suspension or cancellation of the use of adenoviral vectorized ChAdOx1-nCov-19 and Janssen vaccinesin some countries .\nIt has now been proposed that vaccination with ChAdOx1-nCov-19 can result in immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia ( VITT ) mediated by platelet-activating antibodies against Platelet factor-4 , which clinically mimics autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [ 29 ] .\nUnfortunately , the risk was overlooked when authorizing these vaccines , although adenovirus-induced thrombocytopenia has been known for more than a decade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adenoviral vectors [ 30 ] .\nThe risk of VITT would presumably be higher in those already at risk of blood clots , including women who use oral contraceptives [ 31 ] , making it imperative for clinicians to advise their patients accordingly .\nAt the population level , there could also be vaccine-related impacts .\nSARS-CoV-2 is a fast-evolving RNA virus that has so far produced more than 40,000 variants [ 32,33 ] some of which affect the antigenic domain of Spike glycoprotein [ 34,35 ] .\nGiven the high mutation rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-SARS-CoV-2-Spike antibodies could theoretically lead to suboptimal responses against subsequent infections by other variants in vaccinated individuals [ 36 ] , a phenomenon known as \u201c original antigenic sin \u201d [ 37 ] or antigenic priming [ 38 ] .\nIt is unknown to what extent mutations that affect SARS-CoV-2 antigenicity will become fixed during viral evolution [ 39 ] , but vaccines could plausibly act as selective forces driving variants with higher infectivity or transmissibility .\nConsidering the high similarity between known SARS-CoV-2 variants , this scenario is unlikely [ 32,34 ] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more in key epitopes , the global vaccination strategy might have helped shape an even more dangerous virus .\nThis risk has recently been brought to the attention of the WHO as an open letter [ 40 ] .\nThe risks outlined here are a major obstacle to continuing global SARS-CoV-2 vaccination .\nEvidence on the safety of all SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is needed before exposing more people to the184 risk of these experiments , since releasing a candidate vaccine without time to fully understand the resulting impact on health could lead to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 41 ] .\nRisk-stratification of vaccine recipients is essential .\nAccording to the UK government , people below 60 years of age have an extremely low risk of dying from COVID-191 187 .\nHowever , according to Eudravigillance , most of the serious adverse effects following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination occur in people aged 18-64 .\nOf particular concern is the planned vaccination schedule for children aged 6 years and older in the United States and the UK .\nDr. Anthony Fauci recently anticipated that teenagers across the country will be vaccinated in the autumn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the UK is awaiting trial results to commence vaccination of 11 million children under 18 .\nThere is a lack of scientific justification for subjecting healthy children to experimental vaccines , given that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that they have a 99.997 % survival rate if infected with SARS-CoV-2 .\nNot only is COVID-19 irrelevant as a threat to this age group , but there is no reliable evidence to support vaccine efficacy or effectiveness in this population or to rule out harmful side effects of these experimental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physicians advise patients on the elective administration of COVID-19 vaccination , there is a great need to better understand the benefits and risk of administration , particularly in understudied groups .\nIn conclusion , in the context of the rushed emergency-use-authorization of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines , and the current gaps in our understanding of their safety , the following questions must be raised : \u2022 Is it known whether cross-reactive antibodies from previous coronavirus infections or vaccine206 induced antibodies may influence the risk of unintended pathogenesis following vaccination with COVID-19 ?\n\u2022 Has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autoimmunity , and serious adverse reactions been clearly disclosed to vaccine recipients to meet the medical ethics standard of patient understanding for informed consent ?\nIf not , what are the reasons , and how could it be implemented ?\n\u2022 What is the rationale for administering the vaccine to every individual when the risk of dying from COVID-19 is not equal across age groups and clinical conditions and when the phase 3 trials excluded the elderly , children and frequent specific conditions ?\n\u2022 What are the legal rights of patients if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nWho will cover the costs of medical treatment ?\nIf claims were to be settled with public money , has the public been made aware that the vaccine manufacturers have been granted immunity , and their responsibility to compensate those harmed by the vaccine has been transferred to the tax-payers ?\nIn the context of these concerns , we propose halting mass-vaccination and opening an urgent pluralistic , critical , and scientifically-based dialogue on SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among scientists , medical doctors , international health agencies , regulatory authorities , governments , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to bridge the current gap between scientific evidence and public health policy regarding the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines .\nWe are convinced that humanity deserves a deeper understanding of the risks than what is currently touted as the official position .\nAn open scientific dialogue is urgent and indispensable to avoid erosion of public confidence in science and public health and to ensure that the WHO and national health authorities protect the interests of humanity during the current pandemic .\nReturning public health policy to evidence-based medicine , relying on a careful evaluation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt is imperative to follow the science .\nThe authors declare that the

"fortruss--2022-01-07--Drafting Women in Ukraine", "date": "2022-01-07", "source": "fortruss", "title": "Drafting Women in Ukraine", "content": "In a totally delirious drift worthy of the VolkSturm ( which enlisted adolescents , old men , and other civilians to defend Germany at the end of the Third Reich ) , some in Ukraine are thinking to send children to fight in case of war , after the Ministry of Defense has already forced women to register for the draft .\nAt the end of December 2021 , the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense introduced the obligation for women working in several hundred specialties to register to be called upon to serve in the army if necessary .\nAccountants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bus drivers , secretaries and even journalists , millions of Ukrainian women are thus obliged to register for the military and to pass a medical examination to determine if they are able to serve .\nMillions of Ukrainians from 18 to 60 years old ( yes , yes , 60 years old !\n!\n! )\n, even pregnant women , or mothers with young children , will thus be registered forcibly as reserves !\nEmployers or future employers of women entering these specialties must ensure that they have registered in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their jobs or can not be hired .\nUkrainian women have up to the end of 2022 to comply with this order of the Ministry of Defense .\nThose who will dodging the draft can be fined from 510 to 820 hryvnia , and from 850 to 1,700 if the violation is repeated .\nThough the Ukrainian Defense Ministry promises that women will not be subject to military exercises and incorporated into the army only if they wish , in fact , the goal is to force them to the military service with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the former Ukrainian Minister of Justice , Elena Loukach , the voluntary side of the commitment of women thus listed in the military registers is only valid in time of peace .\nThanks to a law adopted by the RADA in April 2021 , in the event of war , \u201c women , listed in the military register , may be called upon to do their military service or participate in work in time to ensure the defense of the \u2018 State \u201c .Actually of course , Ukraine has not been \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2014 and the decree introducing the \u201c exceptional period \u201d ( martial law that does not say its name ) has allowed the mobilization of men .\nThis means that in reality military service and participation in military exercises for women is not at all optional as claimed by the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense , but mandatory just as for men !\nThis measure is neither more nor less than the implementation of the Declaration of Volodymyr Zelensky of December 25 , 2020 , where he said during an interview that in case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Women would be mobilized to defend Ukraine !\nHow has a country of 37 million people ( which therefore theoretically can mobilize several million men ) come to such a measure ?\nWell , it \u2019 s because conscription campaigns have long been a disaster and that Ukraine lacks cannon fodder , sorry , soldiers .\nThe problem is that this measure is raising a lot of trouble in Ukrainian society .\nA petition published on the Ukrainian President \u2019 s site \u2014 requesting the withdrawal of this measure that they qualify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with regard to women \u201d \u2014 has already collected enough signatures to be considered by the head of the state .\nAnd on social networks , Ukrainians and Ukrainians are unleashed against Zelensky and his wife following this order .\nSome emphasized that it is inadmissible that Zelensky forces Ukrainian women to do their military service , while he did not do it himself in 2014-2015 , despite four calls for conscription sent to his address .\nOthers like this woman , interviewed the sidewalk by the Strana media , openly say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the law authorizing the sale of agricultural land ) and they will not go about risking their skin to defend the property of Porochenko or Zelensky .\n\u201c Negative .\nThe land has been sold \u2013 we have nothing to defend .\nIt is out of the question that I defend the property of Poroshenko , Zelensky , and others , \u201d replied the woman .\nShe concluded her remarks with middle finger addressed to the President of Ukraine and his other senior officials : \u201c This is for you !\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under fire from criticism following a post on her Instagram account .\n\u201c Ms .\nZelensky , we are awaiting a response regarding your registration with the military registry , \u201d wrote one of her subscribers .\n\u201c When do you register at the military registration office ?\nShow by example !\nAnother asked .\n\u201c Who had the idea of \u200b\u200bputting women on the military register ?\nIt makes no sense !\n\u201d another commentator wrote .\nSome even demanded a photo of Zelensky \u2019 s wife from the front line .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your photo from the trenches !\n\u201d One commentator wrote wryly .\nFollowing the scandal unleashed in Ukraine by this order from the Defense Ministry , Rada deputies proposed that the registration of women in military registers be voluntary and not compulsory , in order to calm the spirits .\nSixty Ukrainian deputies have thus proposed a bill making the registration of women in military registers voluntary ( except for doctors ) .\nAnd while some try to put out the fire , others add fuel to the it , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an article for Glavred has proposed enlisting the children to defend Ukraine in the event of war with Russia , in what looks like a bad remake of the Volkssturm .\n\u201c There is a reason for recruiting women for military service .\nIt is for Special Ops that the protagonists \u2019 level of training matters .\nBut modern warfare is a statistic of large numbers .\nAccording to which the probable losses of the aggressor are directly proportional to the number of soldiers that the defending side is able to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t matter which \u2013 male , female , or teenage , the bottom line is that they shoot machine guns and other weapons at the enemy .\nIn the case of group fire , the theory of probability will work , and the bullets and shells will find their target , \u201d he writes .\nAnyone knowing a little bit of history ( and among other things that of the Volkssturm , its enormous losses , and its inability in 1944-1945 to stop enemy armies whether in the west or in the east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , and knowing the weaponry available to the Russian army , among other things , can only be stunned in the face of such a heap of nonsense .\nThe only thing that sending inexperienced women and children to shoot against the enemy will succeed in , is dramatically increasing the losses of the Ukrainian side , and deepening the country \u2019 s already abysmal demographic deficit !\nUkraine \u2019 s demographic deficit will certainly worsen more and more following the order of the Defense Ministry to force women to register in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow , all women able to emigrate will do so ( like the men before them ) to escape military enlistment , and prevent their children or future children from being the next to be registered to become soldiers to serve as cannon fodder .", "author": "Tom Winter", "url": "https://fort-russ.com/2022/01/drafting-women-in-ukraine/",

\u2019 s complicated .\nSo is that much fear and loathing all about gas ?\nNot really .\nKazakhstan was rocked into chaos virtually overnight , in principle , because of the doubling of prices for liquefied gas , which reached the ( Russian ) equivalent of 20 rubles per liter ( compare it to an average of 30 rubles in Russia itself ) .\nThat was the spark for nationwide protests spanning every latitude from top business hub Almaty to the Caspian Sea ports of Aktau and Atyrau and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The central government was forced to roll back the gas price to the equivalent of 8 rubles a liter .\nYet that only prompted the next stage of the protests , demanding lower food prices , an end of the vaccination campaign , a lower retirement age for mothers with many children and \u2013 last but not least \u2013 regime change , complete with its own slogan : Shal , ket !\n( \u201c Down with the old man.\n\u201d ) The \u201c old man \u201d is none other than national leader Nursultan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stepped down from the presidency after 29 years in power , in 2019 , for all practical purposes remains the Kazakh gray eminence as head of the Security Council and the arbiter of domestic and foreign policy .\nThe prospect of yet another color revolution inevitably comes to mind : perhaps Turquoise-Yellow \u2013 reflecting the colors of the Kazakh national flag .\nEspecially because right on cue , sharp observers found out that the usual suspects \u2013 the American embassy \u2013 was already \u201c warning \u201d about mass protests as early as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Almaty ?\nOh yeah .\nBut it \u2019 s complicated .\nFor the outside world , it \u2019 s hard to understand why a major energy exporting power such as Kazakhstan needs to increase gas prices for its own population .\nThe reason is \u2013 what else \u2013 unbridled neoliberalism and the proverbial free market shenanigans .\nSince 2019 liquefied gas is electronically traded in Kazakhstan .\nSo keeping price caps \u2013 a decades-long custom \u2013 soon became impossible , as producers were constantly faced with selling their product below cost as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expecting a price hike , as much as everybody in Kazakhstan uses liquefied gas , especially in their converted cars .\nAnd everybody in Kazakhstan has a car , as I was told , ruefully , during my last visit to Almaty , in late 2019 , when I was trying in vain to find a taxi to head downtown .\nIt \u2019 s quite telling that the protests started in the city of Zhanaozen , smack into the oil/gas hub of Mangystau .\nAnd it \u2019 s also telling that Unrest Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation \u2019 s real business hub , and not the isolated , government infrastructure-heavy capital in the middle of the steppes .\nAt first President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev seemed to have been caught in a deer facing the headlights situation .\nHe promised the return of price caps , installed a state of emergency/curfew both in Almaty and Mangystau ( then nationwide ) while accepting the current government \u2019 s resignation en masse and appointing a faceless Deputy Prime Minister , Alikhan Smailov , as interim PM until the formation of a new cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unrest .\nIn lightning fast succession , we had the storming of the Almaty Akimat ( mayor \u2019 s office ) ; protesters shooting at the Army ; a Nazarbayev monument demolished in Taldykorgan ; his former residence in Almaty taken over ; Kazakhtelecom disconnecting the whole country from the internet ; several members of the National Guard \u2013 armored vehicles included \u2013 joining the protesters in Aktau ; ATMs gone dead .\nAnd then Almaty , plunged into complete chaos , was virtually seized by the protesters , including its international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under extra security , and in the evening had become occupied territory .\nKazakh airspace , meanwhile , had to contend with an extended traffic jam of private jets leaving to Moscow and Western Europe .\nEven though the Kremlin noted that Nur-Sultan had not asked for any Russian help , a \u201c special delegation \u201d was soon flying out of Moscow .\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov cautiously stressed , \u201c we are convinced that our Kazakh friends can independently solve their internal problems \u201d , adding , \u201c it is important that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How could it all derail so fast ?\nUp to now , the succession game in Kazakhstan had been seen mostly as a hit across Northern Eurasia .\nLocal honchos , oligarchs and the comprador elites all kept their fiefdoms and sources of income .\nAnd yet , off the record , I was told in Nur-Sultan in late 2019 there would be serious problems ahead when some regional clans would come to collect \u2013 as in confronting \u201c the old man \u201d Nazarbayev and the system he put in place .\nTokayev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to succumb to internal and external provocations \u201d \u2013 which makes sense \u2013 yet also assured that the government \u201c will not fall \u201d .\nWell , it was already falling , even after an emergency meeting trying to address the tangled web of socioeconomic problems with a promise that all \u201c legitimate demands \u201d by the protesters will be met .\nThis did not play out as a classic regime change scenario \u2013 at least initially .\nThe configuration was of a fluid , amorphous state of chaos , as the \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply incapable of comprehending the wider social malaise .\nA competent political opposition is non-existent : there \u2019 s no political exchange .\nCivil society has no channels to express itself .\nSo yes : there \u2019 s a riot goin \u2019 on \u2013 to quote American rhythm \u2019 n blues .\nAnd everyone is a loser .\nWhat is still not exactly clear is which conflicting clans are flaming the protests \u2013 and what is their agenda in case they \u2019 d have a shot at power .\nAfter all , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simultaneously all over this vast nation virtually overnight .\nKazakhstan was the last republic to leave the collapsing USSR over three decades ago , in December 1991 .\nUnder Nazarbayev , it immediately engaged in a self-described \u201c multi-vector \u201d foreign policy .\nUp to now , Nur-Sultan was skillfully positioning itself as a prime diplomatic mediator \u2013 from discussions on the Iranian nuclear program as early as 2013 to the war in/on Syria from 2016 .\nThe target : to solidify itself as the quintessential bridge between Europe and Asia .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were officially launched by Xi Jinping at Nazarbayev University in September 2013 .\nThat happened to swiftly dovetail with the Kazakh concept of Eurasian economic integration , crafted after Nazarbayev \u2019 s own government spending project , Nurly Zhol ( \u201c Bright Path \u201d ) , designed to turbo-charge the economy after the 2008-9 financial crisis .\nIn September 2015 , in Beijing , Nazarbayev aligned Nurly Zhol with BRI , de facto propelling Kazakhstan to the heart of the new Eurasian integration order .\nGeostrategically , the largest landlocked nation on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Chinese and Russian visions , BRI and the Eurasia Economic Union ( EAEU ) .\nFor Russia , Kazakhstan is even more strategic than for China .\nNur-Sultan signed the CSTO treaty in 2003 .\nIt \u2019 s a key member of the EAEU .\nBoth nations have massive military-technical ties and conduct strategic space cooperation in Baikonur .\nRussian has the status of an official language , spoken by 51 % of the republic \u2019 s citizens .\nAt least 3.5 million Russians live in Kazakhstan .\nIt \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c revolution \u201d tinged with national liberation colors were the old system to eventually collapse .\nAnd even if that happened , Moscow will never lose all of its considerable political influence .\nSo the immediate problem is to assure Kazakhstan \u2019 s stability .\nThe protests must be dispersed .\nThere will be plenty of economic concessions .\nPermanent destabilizing chaos simply can not be tolerated \u2013 and Moscow knows it by heart .\nAnother \u2013 rolling \u2013 Maidan is out of the question .\nThe Belarus equation has shown how a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the CSTO agreements do not cover assistance in case of internal political crises \u2013 and Tokayev did not seem to be inclined to make such a request .\nUntil he did .\nHe called for the CSTO to intervene to restore order .\nThere will be a military enforced curfew .\nAnd Nur-Sultan may even confiscate the assets of US and UK companies which are allegedly sponsoring the protests .\nThis is how Nikol Pashinyan , chairman of the CSTO Collective Security Council and Prime Minister of Armenia , framed it : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security \u201d and the \u201c sovereignty \u201d of Kazakhstan , \u201c caused , inter alia , by outside interference.\n\u201d So the CSTO \u201c decided to send peacekeeping forces \u201d to normalize the situation , \u201c for a limited period of time \u201d .\nThe usual destabilizing suspects are well known .\nThey may not have the reach , the political influence , and the necessary amount of Trojan horses to keep Kazakhstan on fire indefinitely .\nAt least the Trojan horses themselves are being very explicit .\nThey want an immediate release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a provisional government of \u201c reputable \u201d citizens ; and \u2013 what else \u2013 \u201c withdrawal of all alliances with Russia.\n\u201d And then it all gets down to the level of ridiculous farce , as the EU starts calling on Kazakh authorities to \u201c respect the right to peaceful protests.\n\u201d As in allowing total anarchy , robbery , looting , hundreds of vehicles destroyed , attacks with assault rifles , ATMs and even the Duty Free at Almaty airport completely plundered .\nThis analysis ( in Russian ) covers some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internet is full of pre-arranged propaganda posters and memos to the rebels \u201d and the fact that \u201c the authorities are not cleaning up the mess , as Lukashenko did in Belarus.\n\u201d Slogans so far seem to originate from plenty of sources \u2013 extolling everything from a \u201c western path \u201d to Kazakhstan to polygamy and Sharia law : \u201c There is no single goal yet , it has not been identified .\nThe result will come later .\nIt is usually the same .\nThe elimination of sovereignty , external management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the formation of an anti-Russian political party.\n\u201d Putin , Lukashenko and Tokayev spent a long time over the phone , at the initiative of Lukashenko .\nThe leaders of all CSTO members are in close contact .\nA master game plan \u2013 as in a massive \u201c anti-terrorist operation \u201d \u2013 has

to understand the argument between the Federalists and anti-Federalists was never solved , but the Federalists ( essentially today \u2019 s corporate America ) have played dirty ever since , one only need examine the history of the 11th Amendment and the associated , suspect , idea the USA has rightfully asserted the doctrine of Sovereign Immunity : The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State , or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State .\n\u2013 11th Amendment What had happened here , is a contractor from South Carolina was owed a Revolutionary War debt by the State of Georgia , which didn \u2019 t want to pay up .\nThe Supreme Court had ruled there was no such thing as state sovereign immunity , in the case of Chisholm v Georgia .\n\u201c Chisholm v. Georgia , 2 U.S. ( 2 Dall . )\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first United States Supreme Court case of significance and impact .\nSince the case was argued prior to the establishment of judicial review by Marbury v. Madison ( 1803 ) , there was little available legal precedent ( particularly in U.S. law ) .\nThe Court , in a 4-1 decision , ruled in favor of Alexander Chisholm , a citizen of South Carolina , stating that states did not enjoy sovereign immunity from suits made by citizens of other states in federal court \u201d [ 4 ] Nearly all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having to pay up on their war debts and the 11th Amendment was passed , posthaste : \u201c To this day , Chisholm stands as one of only a handful of Supreme Court rulings that have been overturned by constitutional amendment .\nEven more important , the Supreme Court has built on the repudiation of Chisholm to hold that the Eleventh Amendment exemplifies a sovereign-immunity principle that sweeps well beyond the amendment \u2019 s text \u201d [ 5 ] And just like that , two immediate and a third , remarkable things happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is specific and narrow , and doesn \u2019 t so much as mention Sovereign Immunity , the legendary English Common Law expert William Blackstone \u2019 s Sovereign Immunity doctrine is reinstated in the former colonies : \u201c The King moreover is not only incapable of doing wrong , but even of thinking wrong ; he can never mean to do an improper thing : in him is no folly or weakness.\n\u201d Only now , suddenly it is no longer the \u2018 King \u2019 can act with impunity , but the institutions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n2 ) With the passing of the 11th Amendment by the several states \u2019 legislators , all of the lawsuits pending in federal court per state war debts had been erased , and half the language of Article One , Section Nine , of the Constitution had been tossed into the ash bin : \u201c No Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed.\n\u201d Thomas Jefferson indicated this language had been meant to cover both criminal and civil circumstance of law , and the constitutional language supports this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attainder \u2019 should refer to criminal , and \u2018 ex post facto \u2019 should refer to civil liabilities .\nIn other words , the USA should not have been allowed to make law , criminalizing or creating liability , or excusing crime and liability , after the fact , to get the outcome it wants .\nThe 11th Amendment neither mentions nor lifts this other constitutional provision .\nBut now , civil ex post facto law happens frequently , such as Congress \u2018 forgiving \u2019 the telecom companies illegally spying on Americans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day in court .\n3 ) The third thing to happen was , as late as 1991 , in Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak , the Supreme Court wrote : \u201c we have understood the Eleventh Amendment to stand not so much for what it says , but for the presupposition of our constitutional structure which it confirms : that the States entered the feudal system with their sovereignty intact , that the judicial authority in Article III is limited by this sovereignty , and that a State will therefore not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has consented to suit , either expressly or in the \u201c plan of the convention \u201d [ my correction of SCOTUS language in bold ] And there you have it , from the early days of the Supreme Court saying Sovereign Immunity is a non existent thing in immediate post colonial USA law , to the several states \u2019 legislatures passing the 11th Amendment which doesn \u2019 t so much as mention Sovereign Immunity , to escape war debt , to the modern Supreme Court stating the language of our constitution \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it actually says , but instead means what they want it to say , essentially stating \u2018 we \u2019 ll extend \u2018 the King \u2019 s prerogative \u2018 as far as we please , and we \u2019 ll use the 11th Amendment to absurdly assert what amounts to a claim the King \u2019 s Sovereign Immunity ( impunity ) was never a point of the American Revolution.\n\u2019 Here \u2019 s the simple math : From King George III was our \u2018 sovereign \u2019 entitled to immunity ( amounting to impunity ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereign , to politicians claiming they hold the people \u2019 s sovereignty ( amounting to impunity ) , to judges appointed by those very politicians upholding this political theft of our freedoms , to the oath to uphold our constitution becoming patently meaningless , especially when cases come before the courts .\n[ 6 ] It is in the light of this preceding we can examine ( shortly ) Rall \u2019 s \u201c hilariously \u201d ignorant idea ( his second paragraph quoted at the beginning of this article ) there is no existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution as written .\nIn fact , with the enfranchisement of women ( right to vote ) via the 19th Amendment , the constitution \u2019 s \u201c Equal Protection \u201d of the law should have served as basis for enforcing gender equality .\nBut what is it Rall ( and liberals generally ) don \u2019 t want to be honest about ?\nIf THERE WERE gender equality , in a context of \u2018 equal protection of the law \u2019 , women would be subject to military conscription , not only men .\nPeople @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( together with their heads ) out of where the sun never shines in their small understanding of the difficulties attending social evolution , probably because they fear losing it .\nInsofar as Rall asserting the USA constitution \u201c a work of genius it is not \u201d should recall the same people ( the anti-federalists which , as a popular movement , ratified the \u2018 Bill of Rights \u2019 from New Hampshire to Georgia ) who wrote the 2nd Amendment also wrote the 4th amendment concerning privacy in one \u2019 s papers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-federalists \u2019 actual intentions .\nAs well , other rights , for instance prohibition of a bill of attainder , prevention of ( warrantless ) unreasonable searches & seizures and the right to confront your accuser .\nTo name but a few provisions of the first through eighth amendments authored by the anti-federalists .\nIf our \u201c Bill of Rights \u201d had been insisted upon by anti-federalists ( James Madison was the compromise proxy author ) , and it most certainly was , the entire world is indebted to our \u2018 hilariously archaic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Civil and Political Rights inspired by the American Bill of Rights and certain of its provisions .\nThe 2nd Amendment \u2019 s original intent had been to secure these rights against the state .\nWell , it didn \u2019 t work out as planned because of the Federalist heirs \u2019 dirty play , related dirty propaganda , that , and a self-righteous , arrogant ignorance coupled with moral turpitude & ethical cowardice across all sectors of society .\nTo be honest , humankind is not yet evolved to point of functioning within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other Western democracies , such as Germany , have functioning constitutions because they can be easily amended .\nSquare that with the reality of German politics and its role in imperialism within today \u2019 s European Union ; the best joke ( cartoon in reality ) a cynic could dream up : 1 ) Merkel goes out with a torch-lit parade featuring military sporting Nazi era helmets and music by the lover of an SS criminal executed for war crimes and gets a standing ovation at the Reichstag a day or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain NATO aggressive states \u2019 political behaviors embedded in the European Union .\n[ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] So , going to the history of judicial corruption in the dirty play of the modern Federalists ( today \u2019 s corporate America , spanning the political spectrum from Chevron \u2019 s Condoleezza Rice to Microsoft \u2019 s Bill Gates ) , we can wrap up this \u2018 Rall Constitutional Vivisection \u2019 with the doctrine of \u201c Strict Scrutiny \u201d which was the WWII era invention of the USA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom protections when the new doctrine was employed to over-ride fundamental rights to secure a Federalist \u2018 compelling state interest \u2019 ( includes \u2018 sovereign immunity \u2019 from suit and suspension of habeas corpus ) with the internment of the USA \u2019 s Japanese-American population across the board .\nThat was more than a simple prescience constituting a precedent , it was the judicial power grab that prepared the USA for the so-called \u2018 National Security Act of 1947 \u2019 , authorizing creation of the CIA , resultant color revolutions , creation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the so-called \u2018 Patriot Act \u2019 and the only thing \u2018 secured \u2019 was color of law

international competitors in a technology race with far-reaching military and diplomatic implications .\nHypersonic weapons are one of six emerging technologies the Pentagon believes could dictate the outcomes of future conflicts , but as America \u2019 s competitors continue to field new hypersonic missiles\u2026 the U.S. \u2019 own efforts continue to rack up failures .\nSo what gives ?\nHow is it possible that the United States , with a $ 700+ billion annual defense budget , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service while Russia \u2019 s military , assigned just $ 61 billion annually , already has two ?\nWell , the truth , as truths tend to be , is complicated , and as we \u2019 ll see a few hundred words from now , that very question may misrepresent the true nature of the hypersonic arms race we now find ourselves in .\nLast week , we explored the hypersonic missiles America \u2019 s competitors in Russia and China already have in service , and briefly discussed America \u2019 s efforts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , it \u2019 s time to explore the reasons America has fallen behind in this rapidly advancing field .\nDespite leading the world in hypersonic technologies in the \u2019 90s and having plans for hypersonic aircraft dating back to the 1950s , the past two decades of asymmetric conflicts in the Middle East forced a shift in focus away from advancing military technologies and toward the large scale employment of existing combat systems .\nLike the F-14 and F-22 Raptor , hypersonic missiles were seen as incredibly expensive weapons with no potent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , with a new Cold War of sorts kicking off between world powers , the Pentagon is making up for lost time the best way it knows how : by throwing a bunch of money at the problem .\nIn 2020 , the Pentagon devoted just over $ 2 billion to developing hypersonic technologies , including missiles .\nIn 2021 , that number jumped to $ 3.2 billion .\nIt grew once again in the Defense Department \u2019 s 2022 budget proposal , with $ 3.8 billion now earmarked for the effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least 70 hypersonic programs drawing funds from this pool , seven of which are for publicly disclosed hypersonic missiles .\nHypersonic missiles tend to come in two forms : hypersonic glide vehicles ( HGVs ) and hypersonic cruise missiles ( HCMs ) .\nFor a refresher on the differences between them , make sure to check out our previous coverage .\nWhy is the US behind in fielding hypersonic missiles ?\nThe United States is indeed lagging behind the competition in fielding operational hypersonic missiles , but the word operational can be pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , says their premiere stealth fighter , the Su-57 , is in operational service despite possessing only a single production aircraft and a dozen prototypes .\nBy American military standards , the Felon would still be many years away from earning that coveted \u201c operational \u201d label .\nBut the fact remains that the United States still appears to be literally years away from fielding a hypersonic weapon , and in the minds of many , that \u2019 s a serious problem .\nAmerica isn \u2019 t as far behind as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cutting edge connotation to it and recent media coverage of these technologies has treated the realm of hypersonic flight like it \u2019 s right out of a science fiction movie .\nThe truth , however , is that hypersonic platforms have already been around for decades , and you \u2019 re almost certainly already familiar with a number of them .\nThe hypersonic barrier is , as we \u2019 ve already discussed , Mach 5 , or approximately 3,838 miles per hour .\nAt these speeds , air itself becomes the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough friction to damage or even incinerate most common aircraft and missile materials .\nThe space shuttle , however , regularly exceeded Mach 25 , or more than 17,500 miles per hour , during reentry .\nThe Air Force \u2019 s current ( and secretive ) X-37B can also reach these blistering speeds .\nIn fact , practically every ballistic missile and spacecraft mankind has ever launched had been and still is hypersonic in nature .\nThat means , not only does the U.S. already possess a wide variety of hypersonic platforms just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operated by Americans like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos can claim hypersonic capabilities .\nThat \u2019 s not to say that we should adjust the hypersonic weapons conversation to include everything from NASA \u2019 s Mercury missions to SpaceX \u2019 s latest Crew Dragon flights .\nRather , it \u2019 s meant to highlight the selective use of the term \u201c hypersonic \u201d in most media to frame the discussion specifically around the capabilities America lacks .\nThat is , after all , the more dramatic story .\nBoth Russia and China , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to aid in their own defense efforts , with China testing their own version of America \u2019 s X-37B for the first time in September of 2020 , and Russia announcing the development of their own \u201c X-37B-like \u201d reusable spacecraft in March of 2021 .\nWhen viewing hypersonics through a lens of reusable military space platforms then , the United States has the resounding lead .\nThe X-37B made its space debut nearly 12 years ago now .\nThe competition isn \u2019 t as far ahead as they seem either Even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contemporary sense of the word , the U.S. again has a solid pedigree .\nAll the way back in 2004 , NASA \u2019 s 12-foot long scramjet technology demonstrator known as the X-43A reached Mach 9.6 in testing .\nIn 2011 , Boeing \u2019 s B-51 Waverider , also a scramjet technology demonstrator , flew under scramjet power for 210 seconds , reaching Mach 5.1 .\nIn August of that same year , DARPA \u2019 s Falcon Project and its HTV-2 boost-glide vehicle achieved Mach 20 during a nine-minute flight test .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia conducted a joint test of the HiFire scramjet missile , reaching speeds in excess of Mach 8 .\nMeanwhile , Russia \u2019 s Kh-47M2 Kinzhal ( or Dagger ) , which entered service in 2017 , is neither a hypersonic boost-glide vehicle nor is it a scramjet-powered cruise missile .\nInstead , it \u2019 s little more than the first stage of a 9K720 Iskander short-range ballistic missile married to a new targeting apparatus and mounted on the belly of a MiG-31 ( or carried inside Tu-22M3 bombers ) .\nIn other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballistic missile made of components that were largely designed all the way back in 1988 .\nLike so many of Russia \u2019 s highest-profile weapons , the Kh-47M2 is little more than a redress of Soviet-era firepower .\nWhile this sort of weapon does offer Russia increased military capability , there \u2019 s little practical value in the U.S. rushing a similarly rudimentary design into service beyond garnering press attention , which is , of course , one of Russia \u2019 s longstanding strategic goals ( making the deployment of the Kinzhal a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States \u2019 hypersonic missile efforts currently include at least two hypersonic boost-glide vehicles and potentially up to five hypersonic cruise missiles leveraging scramjet propulsion .\nA scramjet , or supersonic ramjet , is essentially an air-breathing jet engine that reaches combustion with supersonic airflow ( unlike traditional ramjets which use shock cones to reduce airflow to subsonic speeds ) .\nThis type of propulsion allows for incredibly high rates of travel , but it needs to rely on a conventional source of power , whether a ramjet or a rocket booster , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well .\nOf course , putting a ramjet/scramjet-powered weapon system into service has never been done by any nation before , making it pretty logical that this effort would lag behind Russia \u2019 s approach to using old technology and brute force to enter the hypersonic arena .\nAmerica \u2019 s approach will result in a longer timeline to service , but it may well also result in far more capable weapon systems in the long run .\nRussia and China both do have hypersonic boost-glide vehicle weapon systems in service , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this specific realm , there \u2019 s no denying that the U.S. has yet to match that capability\u2026 but there may be good reason for that too .\nAmerica only has plans to develop new conventional , or non-nuclear , hypersonic weapons at this point , and that poses larger technical challenges than fielding nuclear ones .\nNuclear weapons , as you can imagine , don \u2019 t need to be nearly as accurate because of the relative size of their blast radius .\nA conventional weapon , on the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as such , must be more accurate in order to destroy its target .\nThis point was laid out more than once in a recent report on hypersonic missiles published by the Congressional Research Service : Both of Russia \u2019 s operational hypersonic weapons , the KH-47M2 Kinzhal and the Avangard boost-glide vehicle , can

targets at great distances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and to date , there \u2019 s little evidence to suggest that their targeting apparatus could accomplish such a feat with a conventional warhead .\nThere \u2019 s an argument to be made that new and more advanced nuclear weapons , hypersonic or otherwise , offer little strategic value .\nAny nuclear exchange would almost certainly result in full-scale nuclear war , so unless a new weapon can neuter the opposition \u2019 s nuclear triad or equivalent , a dated nuke is just as good as a 21st-century one .\nStrategic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that forces a shift in your opponent \u2019 s strategy .\nTo date , Russia \u2019 s hypersonic weapons don \u2019 t seem to cross that barrier .\nChina , however , has forced a massive shift in U.S. Navy and Marine Corps priorities thanks to the introduction of the DF-17 , but it \u2019 s still important to remember that this shift is based on the expectation that China will eventually get over the massive technical hurdles associated with targeted a moving vessel at range\u2026 not necessarily the understanding that they already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technical failures can \u2019 t be ignored It seems clear that the conversation about the modern hypersonic arms race has been slightly skewed by a combination of confusion about the latest defense buzzword and maybe even some good old fashioned media sensationalism .\nBut to call that the end of this story would mean ignoring the Mach 5 elephant in the room : America \u2019 s hypersonic weapons programs have been riddled with failure in recent years .\nWhen looking back at hypersonic test programs operated by the Department of Defense over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the tech demonstrator tests discussed earlier ) , you won \u2019 t just find a list ripe with frustrating failures , but seemingly preventable ones .\nMany of these failures occurred before reaching hypersonic velocities , meaning it was tried and true technology like rocket boosters and stage separation mechanisms that went wrong .\nMost frustrating of all , there \u2019 s no data to be poured over with these sorts of failures , and thus , no lessons to be learned about the nature of hypersonic flight .\nOut of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed due to problems with the missile \u2019 s conventional rocket booster , with one other called a total failure for undisclosed reasons .\nTwo more failed due to issues with stage separation mechanisms or control fins , both of which are technologies the U.S. has had in service for decades .\nAn additional three tests were considered partial failures after achieving hypersonic speeds before something went wrong .\nIn all , the Pentagon has only had six successful hypersonic weapons tests since 2010 , with the most recent in September of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only successful test out of America \u2019 s last five attempts .\nThe most recent failure came on October 21 of this year , when again , a conventional rocket booster failed .\nIf these were tests in Geometry instead of hypersonic missiles , it \u2019 s safe to say America would be looking at summer school .\nAmerica \u2019 s limited test infrastructure can \u2019 t be ignored either But weapons tests are supposed to fail , that \u2019 s the very nature of testing .\nThere \u2019 s no telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China have experienced in their own hypersonic efforts , thanks to these nations lacking a free press to report on them .\nThe more egregious issue here isn \u2019 t necessarily that 10 out of 16 tests at least partially failed\u2026 it \u2019 s that the United States has only conducted 16 tests since 2010 to begin with .\nThe fact of the matter is , until recently , the U.S. simply didn \u2019 t feel a pressing need to invest in hypersonic technology .\nBut even after the defense apparatus shifted focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area of focus .\nThat means hypersonic weapons have to compete for time on test ranges with other developmental programs that have similarly far-reaching implications and national importance .\nIt \u2019 s not just military test ranges holding hypersonic efforts back .\nThere is only one wind tunnel in the country that can manage both the high speeds and the high temperatures associated with hypersonics testing , and it belongs to NASA ( who have their own programs to focus on ) .\nThe U.S. has earmarked around $ 500 million to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choke point , but it \u2019 s not the only one .\nTest range facilities are expanding , but will remain limited for years to come .\nThe hypersonics arms race isn \u2019 t quite what it seems Maybe it \u2019 s not quite fair to say that nobody is currently winning the hypersonic arms race , because it seems clear that not all nations are pursuing this technology with the same goals .\nFor a nation like Russia , suffering under international sanctions and a stagnate economy , fielding the first hypersonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer little in the way of strategic capability , but garnered the nation \u2019 s weapon programs a great deal of international attention and prestige .\nThat matters for a country that can \u2019 t afford to repair its single , ailing aircraft carrier , has struggled to fund its standing Su-57 orders , and has yet to find a way to finance large-scale production of their advanced T-14 Armata tank ( among a long list of other unfunded or underfunded programs ) .\nRussia needs foreign buyers for platforms like their new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to afford to build their own in any real numbers .\nThe same can be said for advanced missile systems .\nChina \u2019 s hypersonic goals have a lot to do with presenting an image of military parity with the United States , in keeping with their stated aim of becoming the dominant world power by 2049 .\nThe DF-17 system has also forced the U.S. military to reconsider its approach to force projection in the Pacific , making it a successful strategic weapon even if it never proves capable of hitting an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there \u2019 s the United States , which is not reliant on foreign weapon sales to fund its own programs , and is already perceived as the world \u2019 s preeminent military power .\nAmerica has nothing to gain by rushing a hypersonic weapon into service beyond prestige , but prestige itself is a funny game .\nRussia and China \u2019 s hypersonic weapons have been in service for a few years , and it stands to reason that America \u2019 s missiles could be as much as five years behind them before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point forward , the hypersonic arms race will stop being about when each nation brings them online and start being about the strategic and tactical capability these weapons provide .\nAmerica was poorly positioned to win the first leg of this race , but is now well-positioned to win the second .\nAnd the truth is , while the first sprint is aimed at winning headlines , the second , while perhaps less prestigious in the eyes of the media , is aimed at winning wars .", "author": "Guest Author", "url": "https://fort-russ.com/2022/01/is-america-really-losing-the-hypersonic-arms-race/", "published": "Mon, 10 Jan 2022 01:41:29 +0000", "published_utc":

"content": "Kazakhstan is potentially a watered down version of the Ukrainian Crisis , Tim Kirby writes .\nIt seems that a very typical Color Revolution scenario is starting to play out in Kazakhstan just as it did in many former Soviet Republics .\nThe big issue for those who are actually concerned with Human Rights is whether this will degenerate into a Ukrainian Maidan type of scenario leading to oppression , war and brutal poverty for the masses .\nSo where is this all going and why is it happening now at this moment in history ?\nWhy does the chaos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nUsually , it is something like elections or a new unpopular policy that gets people out onto the streets .\nThe failed White Ribbon movement of 2010-2011 in Russia was in response to \u201c electoral falsification \u201d that seems to have been falsified itself .\nThe Turkish Gezi Park protests of 2013 vastly overblew issues related to demonstrations for the good said park .\nScreenshot : Video of a local Kazakh man saying the people want to live like in \u201c Sweden or Norway \u201d has gone viral on Russian social media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assertions of Western superiority are textbook Color Revolution strategies .\nIn the case of Kazakhstan it is the price of natural gas which has ( ironically ) sparked massive highly organized protests that seem to come out of nowhere .\nThe demands of the disgruntled during a Color Revolution are always either abstract or impossible .\nAbstract demands are things like \u201c we want Democracy even if we can not define it \u201d and impossible ones like \u201c the entire government must step down because of feelings \u201d are perfect examples .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter , that the government should just go quietly off into the night of their own volition .\nSince no government in history has unilaterally stepped down because of protestors \u2019 fancy signs and pointing while sputtering we know that this demand can not be met and thus is used as a justification for revolution and further action .\nThe Mainstream Media is also critical for any Color Revolution because they are the ones who can convince the public that the actual overthrow of the government has been completed .\nIf every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the dollar is worthless , it would be .\nThus , if all media shrieks that a revolution has taken place , then it essentially has .\nCNN is already on the case weaving their narrative but at least they were fair enough to point out that the government has already buckled to the gas price issue , giving the protestors in theory what they initially wanted , but that is not going to stop their organizers who have a whole laundry list of impossible to meet demands .\nWill the scenario @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In many ways Ukraine and Kazakhstan are similar but they are far from being the same .\nAlthough the territory of Kazakhstan has been a part of Russia for hundreds of years and the majority of the population still prefers to speak Russian , the Ukraine is the inalienable cradle of Russian Civilization while Kazakhstan is a lovely later addition .\nYou simply can not trace the Tsars all the way back to ancient Almaty .\nAlthough the Russian-speaking population of the Eastern Steppe is big they are mostly non-ethnic Russians which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukraine , who mostly consider themselves Russian .\nScreenshot : Color Revolutions take their toll on monuments \u2013 history and reality are the enemy .\nAs someone who lived in Kazakhstan for two years you could really feel the paradox of Kazakhstan being newly nationalistic yet favorable to the Russian language .\nThe interpretation of historical events like the Russian Revolution and WWII were being quickly rewritten .\nAt the time , even way back then , you could also see ( that just like in Ukraine ) Kazakhstan was trying hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every child learned top-level English with Hollywood movies galore on TV .\nBoth Kiev and Astana/Nur-Sultan have for years ( even before the Maidan ) tried to put governmental pressure onto the Russian language .\nThis is an actual example of the \u201c Institutional Racism \u201d that our rainbow-haired friends always talk about , but because it happens to the Evil Russians it never counts .\nKazakhstan was able to drive out about half of its Russian population through various forms of intimidation and racist hiring practices in the government and big business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that they simply had no choice but to leave or eternally be at the bottom economic rung of society .\nThis exodus means that only about one in four citizens of Kazakhstan are now Russians and they are mostly in the north .\nThere were many rumors that in the early 90s the upper half of the nation could have broken away as it is far more industrial , Soviet-built , ethnically diverse , Russian-speaking and secular than the south .\nWith far fewer Russians remaining and moving the capital from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potentially explosive issue seems to have been resolved , but if Kazakh nationalists start to put together their own Azov Battalions then a break-away people \u2019 s republic is sure to form in the north somewhere .\nScreenshot : Protestors attack an ambulance .\nWhat an odd target .\nIn short , Kazakhstan \u2019 s government has acted much like the one in Ukraine pre-Maidan and there are some similar demographic , linguistic and cultural issues between the two , however they are less extreme as the Ukrainian situation , which almost looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the start that should break into two more logical pieces .\nKazakhstan is potentially a watered down version of the Ukrainian Crisis .\nThe Russo-American factor is always at play Coincidences are not proof of conspiracy , but it is certainly interesting that a new Color Revolution on Russia \u2019 s former territory that could lead to a Maidan scenario has flared up just days before the potentially historic big negotiation session between Putin and Biden .\nScreenshot : Government buildings ablaze \u2013 very similar to the Maidan Revolution .\nAlthough it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unofficially agreed upon going into the meeting , starting a Color Revolution in Kazakhstan will not sit well with Moscow .\nHowever , the necessity to resolve the Ukrainian Crisis and make a final deal about how NATO \u2019 s troops and Washington \u2019 s nukes will be distributed in Europe is of such great importance to the Russians that anarchy in Kazakhstan can be ignored at least for now and the negotiations will go forward mostly unaffected .\nWe can not forget that the U.S. and Russia were on the brink of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Maidan Revolution : once over the absorption of the Crimea , and once due to the potential \u201c big one \u201d attack that was supposed to have been launched by an emboldened Kiev when Biden took office .\nYou can only roll the dice so many times before eventually snake eyes come up , and anything happening in the heart of Central Asia can not be allowed to force the great powers to keep rollin \u2019 them bones .\nSo will Kazakhstan turn into post-Maidan Ukraine ?\nThis is simply a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Russians have really finally mastered the process of deflating Color Revolutions .\nThey lost in Ukraine , won in Belarus and Kazakhstan will be the deciding \u201c best of three \u201d

so that free citizens police , interrogate , and report on each other .\nAcademia , with its woke newspeak , is a god-awful thing .\nOnly through the complete destruction of language can actually fascist policies , which threaten to eradicate humanity , be passed off as progressive , even social-democratic .\nOur aim is to build upon our previous chapters to show that these were not intellectual fishing expeditions \u2013 we \u2019 re here with the receipts .\nJeremy Bentham \u2019 s horrific theory and model of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 positive vision of the future \u2019 which official academia endorses through its ivory-tower liberal idealists as the foundation of \u2018 Smart Cities \u2019 .\nThe Great Reset openly takes its inspiration for the \u2018 Smart City \u2019 from the Panopticon prison system .\nIn his 1975 work , \u2018 Discipline & Punish : The Birth of the Prison \u2019 , the French poststructuralist Michel Foucault , combining the ideas of his Marxist mentor Althusser and those of Nietzsche , looks at Bentham \u2019 s panopticon and traces it back in time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plague .\nHe goes on to describe the 17th century city under quarantine as the basis of our modern conception of prison in horrifically prescient detail , given the present reality of a plague-justified lockdown , citizen tracking , and control system already imprisoning millions of people in Europe and the Anglophone world .\nIs this a mere coincidence ?\nOr have the planners of the Great Reset intentionally taken Foucault \u2019 s critical description of the plague-to-panopticon as their operating system ?\nThe prison grid society , the Panopticist project was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeremy Bentham , as we discussed in \u2018 Smart Cities : The Perfection of the Prison Grid Society \u2019 .\nSmart Cities are not merely poor or distorted manifestations of a genuinely positive vision , they are genealogically defective , going back to that great enemy of humanity , Thomas Hobbes , whose influence on Bentham was profound .\nFrom the perspective of planned development , these new cities are the culmination of several decades of \u2018 green \u2019 initiatives at the heart of public-private synergy initiatives , which has been the meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because of the corporatized decline of western civilization , including at the level of the academy , there has been a compartmentalization and lack of a truly critical interdisciplinary approach .\nThis has left the schools of law , engineering , and technology the task of proposing neo-Benthamian panopticons as Smart Cities , and openly so , but with a shockingly impoverished understanding of political science and political philosophy .\nYou see , in their minds , these things are good .\nAnd yet these fields necessarily inform both the ethical and practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a \u2018 Great Reset \u2019 to \u2018 build back better \u2019 into \u2018 Smart Cities \u2019 .\nNone of which is to say that there isn \u2019 t some attempt to grapple with the ethics of the endeavor at the academic level .\nThe point here is that the state of the academy has been so far impoverished , precisely as the result of the awards for faculty and chairs system has been driven by philanthropy \u2013 a philanthropy which in turn serves the interests of the technocracy , in line with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like its \u2018 Partners Program \u2019 , which works in tandem with its \u2018 Young Global Leaders \u2019 initiative .\nThis creates an echo chamber and vicious cycle , where chairs of departments with powers over curriculum and emphasis of the departments in question , then promote the next generation of candidates through their post-secondary programs , who in turn advance through a \u2018 merit \u2019 program of awards on the basis of embodying the vision already laid out by the WEF .\nIt \u2019 s a gift that keeps on giving .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 as the economics of fascism with its twin system of corporate dominance plus a welfare state , add to it the recent emergence of an official \u2018 in-group vs. out-group \u2019 two-citizen class system , take away meaningful elections , then we can see a parallel construction or analogous evolution of para-fascist technocracy emerging from various fields of \u2018 expertise \u2019 .\nAll without the fachidiots in each field having a view of the entire leviathan .\nThe work of Foucault and his influence on \u2018 Smart Cities \u2019 is not merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rests firmly and openly in the peer-review and academic literature on the construction of Smart Cities .\nWe do not claim that Foucault advocated such , as his analysis is non-advocacy .\nBut the institution he labored in had a reason for his retention .\nFor context , we will first cite the relevant section of the text from the above referenced \u2018 Discipline & Punish \u2019 .\n\u201c This enclosed , segmented space , observed at every point , in which the individuals are inserted in a fixed place , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which all events are recorded , in which an uninterrupted work of writing links the centre and the periphery , in which power is exercised without division , according to a continuous hierarchical figure , in which each individual is constantly located , examined and distributed among the living beings , the sick and the dead \u2013 all this constitutes a compact model of the disciplinary mechanism .\n[ \u2026 ] But there was also the political dream of the plague , [ \u2026 ] The plague-stricken town , traversed throughout by hierarchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town immobilized by the functioning of an extensive power that bears in a distinct way over all individual bodies \u2013 this is the utopia of the perfectly governed city .\nThe plague ( envisaged as a possibility at least ) is the trial in the course of which one may define ideally the exercise of disciplinary power .\nIn order to make rights and laws function , according to pure theory , the jurists place themselves in imagination in the state of nature ; in order to see perfect disciplines functioning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plague.\n\u201d \u2013 ( Michel Foucault , Discipline and Punish : The Birth of the Prison , chapter \u2018 Panopticism \u2019 pp .\n197-198 ) Those who are aware , who have enough of an interdisciplinary foundation to see what is truly developing , find themselves as either renegades of that system , or as its minions and ideologues , whose own motivations border on irrelevant given that the system will always tend to produce the parts which it requires .\nA typical example of these minions can be found at the Queensland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nEmerging from corporate \u2018 synergy \u2019 law studies in the arenas of intellectual property , ecological concerns , international law , and the development of \u2018 Smart Cities \u2019 we find the Datafication and Automation of Human Life Research Program .\nThe entire project is framed just like the \u2018 criticism \u2019 of the IMF which comes from the WEF .\nTheir masthead art reflects that : it is a person imprisoned , and here we are to assume that they are against such a system .\nIf polled , how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illiberal solutions , and instead support a discourse of empowerment ?\nYet the meaning and substance of their work is entirely corporatist and technocratic , demeaning human beings and changing laws from minimum requirements to maximum demands of the technocracy .\nFor example , the work of Lachlan Robb and Felicity Deane of the DAHL program , in \u201c Smart Cities as Panopticon : Highlighting Blockchain \u2019 s Potential for Smart Cities Through Competing Narratives \u201d , we find a microcosm of the inverted world , where technocracy is disguised in the language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstract alone : \u201c This chapter argues that the narratives of smart cities demonstrate the potential value of blockchain technologies .\nDrawing upon competing narratives within the cultural imaginary , both the \u2018 dream \u2019 of a better city , and the \u2018 fear \u2019 of an oppressive structure will highlight the need to consider both Bentham and Foucault \u2019 s Panopticon .\nThe term \u2018 panopticon \u2019 is defined and explored within the context of blockchain technology .\nIn doing so three concepts are identified : the enabling nature of a panopticon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage human flourishing ; and the ability for technology such as this to enhance standards above a basic minimum of the law .\nThis chapter suggests that understanding smart cities , panopticon and blockchain , may allow for a better account for competing narratives of fear that can lead to a deeper understanding of how this technology can be deployed.\n\u201d What is being proposed here is identical to what we have consistently warned about in pieces such as \u2018 Deplorable Until Proven Compliant : Kafka , Social Credit , & Critical Theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community standards , to go from a basic minimum of legality , to enforced maximal conformity to an ideal ; erasure of the distinction between lawfulness and \u2018 virtue \u2019 .\nAlso in the atrocious neo-fascist work of Deane , to add clarity and veracity to our interpretation of the newspeak , we have added , in brackets , the decoded meaning of the newspeak used in \u2018 Panoptic blockchain ecosystems : An exploratory case study of the beef supply chain \u2019 : \u201c Within this paper we look at this technology through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a technologically enabled expression of the modern panopticon , somewhat turned inside out .\n[ It is literal , not inside out ] The term panopticon , first conceptualised by Jeremy Bentham in the 19th century , initially described a physical structure of a jail , which at its heart included a central tower .\nSurrounding the tower are those who are objects of observation , \u2018 the watched \u2019 , or the prisoners .\nThe prisoners \u2019 surroundings and circumstances meant that they could not tell if they were being observed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraged [ terrorized ] to behave in the way that the rules dictated .\nTo do anything short of this would potentially result in punishment after the behaviour had occurred.1 This panopticon can be likened to the existing understanding of law and governance .\nThe suggestion that we promote in this paper is that blockchain technology can augment the negative power [ disciplinary power ] associated with law and governance .\nIndeed , we show how blockchain enables the creation of voluntary common knowledge associations ( voluntary associations ) [ involuntary block-chain-gangs ] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empowered to regulate themselves [ forced to police each other in a collective punishment system ] in a manner which replicates qualities of the panopticon .\nTo illustrate these ideas , we use observations from the Beefledger project [ the project aims to reduce beef availability ] .\nThrough these observations we illustrate why blockchain-enabled technology and the resultant formation of voluntary common knowledge associations can be desirable using the metaphor of the panopticon .\nIn the panopticon , the relationship is a one to-many [ dictatorial and authoritarian ] configuration where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the watcher over the watched ) .\nHowever , blockchains can enable a new role for the \u2018 watched \u2019 - namely , to also be \u2018 watchers \u2019 .\nThe original \u2018 watcher \u2019 can therefore take a step back , conserve energy , and let the subjects do their own supervision [ involuntary block-chain-gangs ] .\nIn this regard , these voluntary associations will benefit [ spare from further punishment ] not just those who participate within them , but the broader community [ community standards created top-down ] .\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create systems suitable for prison , for the free citizens in a society ?\nWhy is the actual failure of the Panopticon prison , built at Millbank , not mentioned ?\nIt did not produce meaningful labor from inmates , and the rate of mental illness and suicides skyrocketed .\nHow is this left unaddressed ?\nThis is because progressivism says that past attempts at social engineering only failed because the past didn \u2019 t enjoy the contemporary state of the science .\nTrust the science .\nIt is here we can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share Bentham \u2019 s conflation of technological innovation with good .\nIn tracing the perfection of this system of the panopticon itself , the new technologies allow the prison to be decentralized and not requiring location .\nMovements , thoughts , activities which today are still legal , can at some later date be declared retroactively illegal , and the same can be used as a pre-crime prediction leading towards the algorithmically based arrest for crimes not yet committed .\nThe prisoners become the prison guards , and taking together Bentham \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have a system which overcomes any potential budgetary obstacle , which Bentham hoped himself to overcome through the tinted glass .\nThe panopticon of the Smart City is a system set up so that free citizens police , interrogate , and report on each other , and worse , internalize these technocratic rules such that a mass-collective Stockholm syndrome is induced .\nWe see this cancer growing already with the \u2018 Karen \u2019 phenomenon on Covid19 mandates .\nLikewise , the system of academia is a system set up so that students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exit \u2018 Stockholmed \u2019 with a discursive framework connotative of liberation but yet ironically denotative of the top-down order of the technocracy .", "author": "Joaquin Flores", "url": "https://fort-russ.com/2022/01/panopticon-how-mainstream-academia-normalized-mass-imprisonment/",

policy and his attitude to the EU seems to be a clone of Trump \u2019 s .\nWhich oddly and incredibly , lends more to the Handmaid scenario than it does Black Mirror .\nHow can we explain how Australia , Britain , Austria , Italy , and more have gone the path of arbitrary and capricious detention and exclusion from society ?\nThe Austrian government mobilized perhaps 500 people into the streets in support of lockdown and apartheid measures , colluding with media to inflate that number by a massive factor of sixty .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polarization of society .\nYet in politics , there are no coincidences .\nSo while the ruling class would prefer little resistance by some metrics , the popularization of resistance and the potentials this arena holds are also promising in elite contingency planning .\nSuch will be our primary focus in this review .\nWhichever holds the most potential and handles resistance in the best way , while carrying out some form of the underlying plan , will be the version of the plan the managers attempt to deliver for the elites .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ those still capable of thinking being demoralized by the state of humanity , and drawing eugenicist conclusions parallel to those of the elites .\nAfter all , how can the great herd of humanity acquiesce in such a way ?\nIf there is a lesson to be learned from history , perhaps it is not \u2018 never again !\n\u2019 so much as \u2018 it will always happen again \u2019 .\nWhile the state and corporate sanctioned hatred espoused by media to the unvaxed has reached an alarming temperature , the counter-narrative of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new age of mass house-arrest and social apartheid is also growing .\nWhile one is situated as an overt policy of the state apparatus , the other builds popular support and has all the trappings and bearings of authenticity , people power , life , and motion .\nIn 168 AD the Greek physician Galen was summoned by the synarchy of Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus then ruling the Roman Empire , to provide guidance on the management of the small-pox pandemic then affecting millions , now called the Antonine Plague .\nNicolas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Plague of Ashdod , 1630 .\nOil on canvas , 148 \u00d7 198 cm .\nMus\u00e9e du Louvre , Paris Then as now , according to Sabbatani and Fiorino ( Infez Med .\n2009 Dec ; 17 ( 4 ) :261-75 ) , the primary factors that led to the pandemic were underlying conditions : primarily poor sanitation and hygiene , and poor diet and access to food .\nA disproportionate number of Roman subjects lived in overcrowded cities , and lived at the hands of landlords , speculators , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 .\nThen as now , all of these factors were socially constructed and were not merely \u2018 facts of life \u2019 as if handed down by the gods , but rather were conditions imposed upon the great mass of humanity by an unhinged oligarchy .\nWhether this plague was seen as beneficial by the oligarchy , for whom \u2013 then as now \u2013 maintenance of a declining population rate was subsidized by coordinated migration from the reaches of the empire \u2013 is a subject of debate .\nDid they see the unwashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metropolis as useless eaters , then as they do now ?\nAt any rate , history views the Antonine Plague as a turning point , after which came an age of inflation and division from which the Roman Empire is said to have never fully recovered .\nThe response to the plague from Christians , with their care for the ill , is also a factor in the rapid growth of this monotheism in the empire .\nUltimately Lucius Verus would himself succumb to the mystery illness the following year in 169 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which provide for us some insight into new methods of biological warfare when class war is the proscribed remedy for surplus population .\nIf manufacturing such a contagion , it would make sense that it be no more lethal than the common cold , and that nevertheless the concentration of power and an economic regimen which also decreased lives and livelihoods could be obtained at a far smaller cost .\nThe Antonine and then Cyprian Plague in the 3rd century AD would together lead towards an increased mysticism , religiosity , and tended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , as now , the scenario fuels the \u2018 Great Awakening \u2019 , and public embrace of conspiracy theories is at an all-time high , just as mysticism and superstitions also grew through the Roman Empire during these centuries .\nProblem-Reaction-Solution , and other things unrelated to Hegel It is said that history repeats or at the very least parallels , but rather than ascribe these to abstract and still mysterious iron laws of history or any providence directing these , perhaps instead these events return and return again because they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marx said , when history does repeat , the first is tragedy , the second is farce .\nThe farce at hand today no doubt is that the plague is real and yet also nary more deadly than the flu .\nAs we previously discussed , it was Foucault who shows convincingly that it was the first the authorized response to the plagues , with its systems of quarantine and mass surveillance , etcetera , that gave initial impulse and inspiration towards the construction of the first modern prisons a century or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in regards to the growth of mysticism , paranoia , and religiosity , we see this growing in all areas , both for and against the mandates .\nCommon now is the paranoia around infection , when the common cold never produced this except among germophobes , or in the ritualized wearing of masks which in fact \u2018 do \u2019 nothing , or rather do something other than what is being publicly explained .\nAnd on the other side , the rapacious and gratuitous abuses by the elites whose evil knows no bounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual or religious awakening against the mandate .\nNaturally those managing for those in power at the very top , above and beyond mere elected politicians and public health \u2018 experts \u2019 , understand this \u2018 problem-reaction-solution \u2019 pattern which has so far worked for them .\nSo in light of that fact , we are drawn to a particularly problematic notice of potential danger scribbled in Schwab \u2019 s Covid-19 book .\nHere we are instructed to infer from the pattern and logic of the text so far , that if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ruling class , with its social credit system \u2013 if this does not work \u2013 then we have a fall-back plan for a sort of Handmaid \u2019 s Tale scenario .\nAs ridiculous at face value as such things may have sounded just a few short years ago , here we are today with open eyes and open minds , understanding precisely such scenarios and their potentials .\nSchwab , for his part , does anyhow .\nIt is there on page 167 that we find it laid out in the standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also something that elites have thought through potential outcomes .\nThat \u2019 s an awfully specific outcome , to be mentioned .\nThe social credit scenario in the Black Mirror seems much more obvious , in part because we are already now living it .\nWhat sorts of problems would be presented so that the reaction could produce that , specifically that , as a solution ?\nInterestingly , we have numerous factors lining up .\nWhile we have noted previously that the population \u2018 Great Replacement \u2019 conspiracy theory popular in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is depicted in films like \u2018 Children of Men \u2019 , a common theme with that dystopia and the Handmaid \u2019 s Tale is a population and reproduction crisis .\nPerhaps it was Victoria \u2018 F*ck the EU \u2019 Nuland who first truthfully articulated a shift in U.S. policy away from Trans-Atlanticism .\nThough , her faction still rests on this doctrine and Biden has struggled to make good on such a return to good EU relations after a stark departure during the Trump years .\nBut an isolated U.S. is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tale .\nIn the TV series version , a more thorough geopolitical situation is relayed to the audience .\nThe premise of the story is that as the result of the overuse of GMOs with their terminator seeds , men \u2019 s sperm count rapidly declined .\nBut because the broader crisis , it ushered in a neo-Puritan theocracy , and women were blamed for it .\nAt the same time , the \u2018 war against boys and men \u2019 theme was depicted as a problem in the U.S. , the reaction to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ militant group with MRA beliefs infused with Christian fundamentalism that ultimately seizes power .\nUndoubtedly , the elites prefer the Black Mirror scenario of a Trans-Atlanticist surveillance state , and indeed that it is not just a social credit state but a surveillance state is also mentioned on the same page 167 in the typical Schwabian manner .\nThis is the method whereby the entire book can be understood , where certain kinds of \u2018 warnings \u2019 are precisely the kinds of outcomes the ruling class wants .\nAnd we know this because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pursued those outcomes for decades .\nThe surveillance state reference relates here to a disingenuous social-democratic nod to Shoshana Zuboff \u2019 s tome \u2018 Surveillance Capitalism \u2019 , mentioned also by Schwab on page 167 in connection to the dystopia warnings on the same page .\nZuboff is a member of the establishment \u2018 temple \u2019 in good standing , and also a member of the \u2018 state \u2019 .\nLike Schwab , she explains the dangers of rapacious predatory capitalism while being a vociferous defender of its ethos .\nIt may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u2019 s possible to hold such positions while also selling one \u2019 s financial services to the very target of the same criticisms .\nBut neuroticism and self-serving hypocrisy are par for the course in that world .\nSchwab pretends to warn and lament that such an outcome like The Handmaid \u2019 s Tale is a possibility of certain societies like the U.S. , if they \u2018 mismanage \u2019 the situation , by which we understand means \u2018 manage precisely as we want once the pushback forces us to \u2019 .\nWhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlanticist model requires increased ideological harmony between the U.S. as Europe is instructed to \u2018 love \u2019 a sort of strange cultural hybrid of intersectional \u2018 black struggle \u2019 with something closer to home , cross-dressing , which a few decades ago we could simply call \u2018 RuPaul \u2019 .\nAnd the U.S. is instructed to look at European \u2018 social democracy \u2019 as an inspirational model , though in practice also it comes with less social and less democracy .\nBut it is the \u2018 vibe \u2019 of a state that provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. it doesn \u2019 t .\nIt feels like it does when Democrats are in office .\nSo together there is some hegemonic ideological construct that conjoins Western Europe to the U.S. , despite that spatially and economically Europe is more dependent on Eastern Europe , China and MENA .\nThere are also big pushes by some dissenting voices within the elites , who got behind Trump and may well still be behind him , that want to collapse Atlanticism all together , meaning the end of NATO but also the IMF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nevertheless bent on population reduction and their own preservation are looking at ways to manage the blowback as well .\nFor reasons beyond our scope here , Biden \u2019 s foreign policy and his attitude to the EU seems to be a clone of Trump \u2019 s .\nWhich oddly and incredibly , lends more to the Handmaid scenario than it does Black Mirror .\nConclusively , while legal and constitutional pushes for election reform and a robust curtailment of the covid restrictions is in order , on our radar screen should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theocratic aims \u2013 not because they challenge the status quo , but because they would be controlled by it .", "author": "Joaquin Flores", "url":

s war is a class war of the super elites , and this can be fought and won by the great masses of people against their own oligarchs .\nThe American deep state is playing upon the public \u2019 s distaste of China towards its own ends , and just as with the present global mystery illness , they will blame China for a social credit system which in reality was made in the USA .\nWe can deconstruct the anatomy of this scam through the handling of Covid and biological warfare in general .\nThis same deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utilize the incessantly bad behaviour of its own rapacious oligarchy , who it must serve , an oligarchy trapped in a system of capital accumulation at all and any costs , even collective suicide , into some sort of controlled paradigm collapse .\nThe incentive to destroy society is just too great compared to the costs of keeping it together .\nThe super elites themselves , like some super virus , can always just vacate the premises and find some other host to infect .\nThis is a pandemic of speculation , usury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Senator Rand Paul exposed in public hearings on the senate floor , was that the novel Corona virus was produced at Dr. Anthony Fauci \u2019 s discretion .\nThis was a project of the U.S. corporate state , of a corrupted U.S. intelligence agency , we conclude from Senator Paul \u2019 s findings .\nThis much is also so well known by now , that it \u2019 s reached the level of common knowledge .\nBut we say it again now not to preach about it , but to connect it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China .\nDigging further , we see it was all based upon long-standing plans to upwards distribute wealth and strip away constitutional rights from citizens , further concentrate socio-economic power , and destroy medium and small businesses .\nBy any definition of the term , this is open class warfare being waged by the ruling class against all other classes .\nAnd so this same ruling class has used the politics of normalized class war to divide and conquer the citizenry along race and gender lines , using new-left tropes , to shift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to abstract identity issues .\nA portion of the intelligentsia and student/youth are weaponised into a faux \u2018 progressive \u2019 militancy against \u2018 Trumpism \u2019 , Antifa and BLM and the non-profit industrial complex all connected to Democracy Action and Sorosian wonderworks .\nThe non-event which was January 6th is used as some sort of newfangled Oklahoma City bombing which only emboldens the parasitic proclivities of the prosecution and investigation power fetishists , which American authoritarianism has allowed to fester in its crevices .\nWell , a non-event except for the unjustified killing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Four officers who died , actually died \u2018 by suicide \u2019 within a week of the event .\nWhat did they know ?\nWhy were they \u2018 suicided \u2019 ?\nMeanwhile the real opponents of Trump are those behind the entire Great Reset and class war of \u2018 some against all \u2019 underway right now in the U.S. And that this is already a burgeoning civil war and inter-elite conflict is also openly known .\nOn December 20th , CNN ran video under the heading , \u201c How close is the U.S. to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , study says \u201d .\nThe accuracy or motivations of the study itself are neither here nor there , we can develop a superior metric and method probably at random , because the situation is obvious .\nThe real point of interest is that America \u2019 s flagship fake news outlet is openly pushing the story .\nWhat could the reason for it be ?\nWhat was said is of particular interest : Host : \u201c The rigid refusal of lawmakers of compromise underscore the disturbing findings of one study on democracy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Post editorial , data from the Center for Systemic Peace finds that the U.S. no longer qualifies as a democracy .\nAfter the Trump administration years , it \u2019 s somewhere between a democracy and an autocratic state .\nBarbara Walter is a professor of International Relation at the School of Global Policy and Strategy at the University of California at San Diego , she joins me now , I \u2019 m delighted .\nWhen we look at the research it \u2019 s frankly frightening , and you conclude that the U.S. is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us would like to Believe .\nHow close ?\n\u201d Barbara Walter : \u201c Well I \u2019 ve been studying civil wars for the last thirty years across the globe , and in fact the last four years I \u2019 ve been on a task force run by the CIA that tries to predict where outside the U.S. a civil war , political violence , and instability is likely to break out .\nAnd we actually know now that the two best predictors of whether violence is likely to happen are whether a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s a fancy term for partial democracy , and whether ethnic entrepreneurs have emerged in a country that are using racial , religious , or ethnic divisions to try to gain political power .\nAnd the amazing thing about the United States is that both of these factors currently exist , and they have emerged at a surprisingly fast rate.\n\u201d Naturally CNN twists words and reason , and makes implications at odds with the real dynamic now working .\nThe \u2018 Trump administration years \u2019 is thrown in to make us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his doing .\nIt was the opposite : it was those opposed to Trump that eroded the republic .\nIt was the collusion of the Great Reset technocracy , the collusion of the IMF , the WEF and domestic players in the Transition Integrity Project ( which we have written so much about ) , big media , big tech , big pharma , the too big to fail , that subverted a populist movement and their rightful electoral outcome .\nThey openly bragged about it and showed the receipts .\nIt is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already openly confessed .\nIn truth , a better study from Princeton concluded in 2014 that the U.S. was no longer a Democracy .\n\u201c A new study from Princeton spells bad news for American democracy\u2014namely , that it no longer exists .\nAsking \u201c [ w ] ho really rules ?\n\u201d researchers Martin Gilens and Benjamin I .\nPage argues that over the past few decades America \u2019 s political system has slowly transformed from a democracy into an oligarchy , where wealthy elites wield most power .\nUsing data drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1981 to 2002 , the two conclude that rich , well-connected individuals on the political scene now steer the direction of the country , regardless of or even against the will of the majority of voters.\n\u201d Of course Barbara Walter is either a liar or an idiot , probably a bit of both , because there is no correlation between a democracy index and stability .\nWell , there is a connection : once the U.S. targets a country or region for destabilization , they begin to point out features of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idealist dream of a utopian democracy .\nAn easy task and a useful trick , given that we are in reality and not a dream .\nThen they go on to lay a trade embargo and other punitive measures , thereby exacerbating the tensions within that society , tensions which all societies in reality actually have .\nThe intelligence agencies foster \u2018 gangs \u2019 , counter-gangs , and political violence in the targeted states , to create failed states .\nThey do this across Africa .\nThey did it in Yugoslavia , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy and stability are directly related works against the truth exposed in the fact of the general tendency of elites in struggling countries to tilt towards dictatorship , in order to bring stability to the instabilities which democratic institutions are subject to , once broader economic issues come to bear .\nThe optimal situation of course are strong democratic institutions which are both justified by , and in turn support , economic prosperity .\nLikewise , the U.S. tilts towards dictatorship not as the result of \u2018 ethnic entrepreneurs \u2019 , whatever that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just now ? )\ngive us any pause .\nRather , the developing system of internal passports , digital ID \u2019 s , Covid pass , forced vaccination and imprisonment under the pretext of \u2018 pandemic \u2019 , these are what ought to , and do , give us cause for great concern .\nWhich brings us back to China .\nThe pretext of the virus was certainly used in China towards its own \u2018 national security \u2019 ends in the digital age .\nRussia has done the same .\nNeither country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experimental , opting instead to use this U.S. manufactured crisis towards its own security advantage .\nAll while not using it to experiment upon the population with untested gene therapies .\nBut China will do China , and a country so far away and so far out of reach of the will and moral authority of American citizens to be concerned about , is hardly the proper focus of American citizen concerns .\nThe biggest problem that Americans face is certainly its own deep state and super elite , who seem to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuse , elective warfare , and the fetishization of power dynamics observed under late capitalism .\nThe focus on China \u2019 s social credit system has a positive effect on western movements against the system insofar as westerners view the developments in Chinese society as negative .\nBut the blame placed on Chinese society has worked against understanding social credit .\nWhile the Chinese social credit system may utilize some of the same technologies as in the U.S. , it is different in context , history , and meaning .\nMost understandable is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferences traditional and socially conservative values , whereas the emergent one in the U.S. imposes bourgeois-libertine values .\nWhile Americans transform their justified fears over social credit , alongside the decline of meaningful work and living standards , into anti-China rhetoric , the focus on China serves as a distraction from what is entirely a domestic and technology-driven phenomenon .\nIf the lesson drawn is that \u2018 we must not become like Chinese society \u2019 , it is missing the mark .\nChina sits in a markedly different position , where its automated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. in many cases , while its large rural population lives in pre-industrial conditions .\nChina \u2019 s social credit system was initially aimed at big firms : imagine something like a \u2018 better business bureau \u2019 and consumer reporting that actually had teeth .\nChina \u2019 s system did not place profitability as the only determining factor for credit worthiness , and given its scale and anonymity , required a numerated system .\nImagine if Pfizer , for example , had reduced access to capital because of its criminal activity .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has come about in the Chinese system , one of the few countries that is prone to execute a billionaire oligarch on occasion .\nChinese billionaire businessman , Liu Han was executed after being found guilty of murder and running a mafia-style criminal gang .\nCredit BBC , February 10 , 2015 When China \u2019 s system was moved forward , its aim was to develop a non-monetary credit system for rural inhabitants who are still living in pre-industrial conditions .\nIt \u2019 s also a massive country , really a civilizational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many regions and varying , even conflicting , credit and legal policies .\nIt is very difficult to implement the modern system of monetary credit when people live on barter , and their psychological motivations relate to not just pre-industrial but pre-modern and onymous social standing .\nBear in mind that China moved through three industrial revolutions within the span of about eighty years , whereas the 1st Industrial Revolution in the U.S. began around 1750 .\nBig tech mirrors aspects of China \u2019 s social credit system , and there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 in the U.S. if we compare it to the Chinese system .\nBut that \u2019 s precisely where we will get it wrong .\nIn our work on Oriental Despotism and Hydraulic societies , we demonstrated the present push by western elites is to prepare for a transition away from a money-regulated ( i.e .\nlabor driven ) society .\nThis leads to their need for a social credit system that matches the post-labor age of the 4th Industrial Revolution .\nThere are certainly Chinese people unhappy with the Chinese social credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is their issue to solve .\nIt \u2019 s a pattern for other countries \u2019 elites to blame its internal woes on the U.S. Whatever truth value those claims have are muddied with the convenience it gives , relieving those political elites of their own responsibilities to govern fairly and justly .\nLikewise , the focus on the \u2018 China virus \u2019 disguises the fact that it was probably created on Dr. Fauci \u2019 s watch , coordinating with Bill Gates and other oligarchs invested in the vaccine mandate scheme .\nSocial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s far too convenient to misplace both blame and understanding of social credit onto China .\nChinese elites , the CCP , the PLA , all have absolutely nothing to do with the growth of social credit on American soil .\nSocial credit in the U.S. has distinctly American characteristics , based in new-left tropes , backed by American companies and none of the Chinese .\nIn the U.S. , social instability has come about through the logic and process of its own machinations , the socio-economic disparity .\nThe growth of authoritarianism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social credit is , if anything , a mitigating force meant to manage the other crises of its own making .\nWhat elites do love to do , however , is blame other countries for their own-goals .\nWhen empires collapse , they often like to engage in \u2018 great resets \u2019 , often total wars .\nToday \u2019 s war is a class war of the super elites , and this can be fought and won by the great masses of people against their own oligarchs .\nIntroducing China as a responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social credit , however , will only serve to embolden our own oligarchy in a great distraction from their own crimes and programs .", "author": "Joaquin Flores", "url":

will not consider Russian proposals on no expansion of NATO , and has no intention of even discussing the idea .\nSo much for \u201c dialogue \u201d .\nIt was the first high-level Russia-NATO meeting since 2019 \u2013 coming immediately after the non sequitur of the U.S.-Russia \u201c security guarantee \u201d non-dialogue dialogue earlier in the week in Geneva .\nSo what happened in Brussels ?\nEssentially yet another non-dialogue dialogue \u2013 complete with a Kafkaesque NATO preface : we \u2019 re prepared for dialogue , but the Kremlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a double down on the American envoy to NATO , Julianne Smith , preemptively blaming Russia for the actions that \u201c accelerated this disaster \u201d .\nBy now every sentient being across Eurasia and its European peninsula should be familiar with Russia \u2019 s top two , rational demands : no further NATO expansion , and no missile systems stationed near its borders .\nNow let \u2019 s switch to the spin machine .\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg \u2019 s platitudes were predictably faithful to his spectacular mediocrity .\nOn the already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c important to start a dialogue \u201d .\nRussia , he said , \u201c urged NATO to refuse to admit Ukraine ; the alliance responded by refusing to compromise on enlargement \u201d .\nYet NATO \u201c welcomed bilateral consultations \u201d on security guarantees .\nNATO also proposed a series of broad security consultations , and \u201c Russia has not yet agreed , but has not ruled out them either.\n\u201d No wonder : the Russians had already noted , even before it happened , that this is noting but stalling tactics .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Stoltenberg defended NATO \u2019 s military blitzkriegs in both Kosovo and Libya : after all \u201c they fell under UN mandates \u201d .\nSo they were benign .\nNot a word on NATO \u2019 s stellar performance in Afghanistan .\nAnd then , the much-awaited clincher : NATO worries about Russian troops \u201c on the border with Ukraine \u201d \u2013 actually from 130 km to 180 km away , inside European Russian territory .\nAnd the alliance considers \u201c untrue \u201d that expansion is \u201c an aggressive act \u201d .\nWhy ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ So here \u2019 s the NATO gospel in a flash .\nNow compare it with the sobering words of Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko .\nGrushko carefully enounced how \u201c NATO is determined to contain Russia .\nThe United States and its allies are trying to achieve superiority in all areas and in all possible theaters of military operations.\n\u201d That was a veiled reference to Full Spectrum Dominance , which since 2002 remains the American gospel .\nGrushko also referred to \u201c Cold War-era containment tactics \u201d , and that \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been halted \u201d \u2013 by NATO .\nStill , \u201c Russia honestly and directly pointed out to NATO that a further slide of the situation could lead to dire consequences for European security.\n\u201d The conclusion was stark : \u201c The Russian Federation and NATO do not have a unifying positive agenda at all.\n\u201d Virtually all Russophobic factions of the bipartisan War Inc. machine in Washington can not possibly accept that there should be no forces stationed on European states that were not members of NATO in 1997 ; and that current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Ukraine as well as in other Eastern European , Transcaucasian , and Central Asian states .\nOn Monday in Geneva , Deputy Foreign Minister Ryabkov had already stressed , once again , that Russia \u2019 s red line is unmovable : \u201c For us , it \u2019 s absolutely mandatory to make sure that Ukraine never , never , ever becomes a member of NATO.\n\u201d Diplomatic sources confirmed that in Geneva , Ryabkov and his team had for all practical purposes to act like teachers in kindergarten , making sure there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now compare it with the U.S. State Department \u2019 s Ned Price , speaking after those grueling eight hours shared between Ryabkov and Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman : Washington will not consider Russian proposals on no expansion of NATO , and has no intention of even discussing the idea .\nSo much for \u201c dialogue \u201d .\nRyabkov confirmed there was no progress .\nReferring to his didacticism , he had to stress , \u201c We are calling on the U.S. to demonstrate a maximum of responsibility at this moment .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ confrontation shouldn \u2019 t be underestimated.\n\u201d To say , in Ryabkov \u2019 s words , that \u201c significant \u201d Russian effort has been made to persuade the Americans that \u201c playing with fire \u201d is not in their interests is the euphemism of the young century .\nLet me sanction you to oblivion A quick recap is crucial to understand how things could have derailed so fast .\nNATO \u2019 s not exactly secret strategy , from the beginning , has been to pressure Moscow to directly negotiate with Kiev on Donbass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Minsk Agreements .\nWhile Moscow was being forced to become part of the Ukraine/Donbass confrontation , it barely broke a sweat smashing a coup cum color revolution in Belarus .\nAfterwards , the Russians assembled in no time an impressive strike force \u2013 with corresponding military infrastructure \u2013 in European Russia territory to respond in lightning quick fashion in case there was a Ukrainian blitzkrieg in Donbass .\nNo wonder an alarmed NATOstan had to do something about the notion of fighting Russia to the last impoverished Ukrainian .\nThey may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be completely destroyed .\nThe beauty is how Moscow turned things around with a new geopolitical jiu-jitsu move .\nUkro-dementia encouraged by NATO \u2013 complete with empty promises of becoming a member \u2013 opened the way for Russia to demand no further NATO expansion , with the withdrawal of all military infrastructure from Eastern Europe to boot .\nIt was obvious that Ryabkov , in his talks with Sherman , would refuse any suggestion that Russia should dismantle the logistical infrastructure set up in its own European Russia territory .\nFor all practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhat was left was meek threats of more sanctions .\nStill , it will be a Sisyphean task to convince the Empire and its NATO satrapies not to stage some sort of military adventure in Ukraine .\nThat \u2019 s the gist of what Ryabkov and Grushko said over and over again in Geneva and Brussels .\nThey also had to stress the obvious : if further sanctions are imposed on Russia , there would be severe blowback especially in Europe .\nBut how is it humanly possible for seasoned pros like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a bunch of amateur blind bats such as Blinken , Sullivan , Nuland and Sherman ?\nThere has been some serious speculation on the timeframe ahead for Russia to in fact not even bother to listen to the American \u201c baby babble \u201d ( copyright Maria Zakharova ) anymore .\nCould be around 2027 , or even 2025 .\nWhat \u2019 s happening next is that the five-year extension of the new START treaty expires in February 2026 .\nThen there will be no ceiling for nuclear strategic weapons .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China will make Gazprom even less dependent on the European market .\nThe combined Russia-China financial system will become nearly impervious to U.S. sanctions .\nThe Russia-China strategic partnership will be sharing even more substantial military tech .\nAll of that is way more consequential than the dirty secret that is not a secret in the current \u201c security guarantees \u201d kabuki : the exceptionalist , \u201c indispensable \u201d nation is congenitally incapable of giving up on the forever expansion of NATO to , well , outer space .\nAt the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a quite prosaic truth ; the U.S. will not fight for Ukraine .\nSo welcome to Instagrammed Irrationalism .\nWhat happens next ?\nMost possibly a provocation , with the possibility , for instance , of a chemical black ops to be blamed on Russia , followed by \u2013 what else \u2013 more sanctions .\nThe package is ready .\nIt comes in the form of a bill by Dem senators supported by the White House to bring \u201c severe costs \u201d to the Russian economy in case Moscow finally answers their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sanctions would directly hit President Putin , Prime Minister Mishustin , Foreign Minister Lavrov , the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces Gen Gerasimov , and \u201c commanders of various branches of the Armed Forces , including the Air Force and Navy.\n\u201d Targeted banks and financial institutions include Sberbank , VTB , Gazprombank , Moscow Credit Bank , Alfa-Bank , Otkritie Bank , PSB , Sovcombank , Transcapitalbank , and the Russian Direct Investment Fund .\nThey would all be cut off from SWIFT .\nIf this bill sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s because it is .\nCall it the American version of \u201c dialogue \u201d .",

Increased Risk of Mortality Since the beginning of the health crisis , the French government has claimed that early treatment was ineffective .\nIt has imposed major restrictions on our freedoms , in particular on doctors \u2019 prescriptions , [ 1 ] It has also promised that vaccination would achieve collective immunity , the end of the crisis and a return to normal life .\nBut the failure for 18 months of this so-called \u201c health strategy \u201d based on false simulations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as the propaganda and fear campaign has become unbearable .\nIn turn this has been followed by the extortion of consent to be vaccinated , by outright blackmail , while curtailing our freedoms to move and socialize , our right to work and engage in leisure activities .\nAre the current vaccines that they want to impose on us effective ?\nCan they lead to a collective immunity or is it only a myth ?\nTo answer this question , we will make the current sanitary assessment of the most vaccinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the World Health Organization and the curves of OurWorldinData .\n( From Vaccine outset in December 2020 to September 15 , 2021 ) Gibraltar ( 34,000 inhabitants ) started vaccination in December 2020 when the health agency counted only 1040 confirmed cases and 5 deaths attributed to covid19 in this country .\nAfter a very comprehensive vaccination blitz , achieving 115 % coverage ( vaccination was extended to many Spanish visitors ) , the number of new infections increased fivefold ( to 5314 ) and the number of deaths increased 19fold .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 97 , i.e .\n2853 deaths per million inhabitants , which is one of the European mortality records .\nBut those responsible for the vaccination deny any causal link without proposing any other plausible etiology .\nAnd after a few months of calm , the epidemic resumed , confirming that 115 % vaccination coverage does not protect against the disease .\nMalta : 84 % vaccine coverage , but just as ineffective Malta is one of the European champions of pseudo-vaccines : on this island of 500,000 inhabitants , nearly 800,000 doses have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nearly 84 % with a delay of about 6 months .\nBut since the beginning of July 2021 , the epidemic has started again and the serious ( fatal ) forms are increasing , forcing the authorities to recognize that vaccination does not protect the population and to impose restrictions .\nHere again , the recurrence of the epidemic in terms of cases and mortality proves that a high rate of vaccination does not protect the population .\nIn Iceland , people no longer believe in herd immunity In this small country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % are primo-vaccinated and 75 % have a complete vaccination cycle .\nBut by mid-July 2021 , new daily infections had risen from about 10 to about 120 , before stabilizing at a rate higher than the pre-vaccination period .\nThis sudden recurrence convinced the chief epidemiologist of the impossibility of obtaining collective immunity through vaccination .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a myth , \u201d he publicly declared .\nBelgium : recurrence of the disease despite vaccinationTrends in Mortality and Morbidity in the Most Vaccinated Countries : Twenty-one Proven Facts In Belgium , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primo-vaccinated .\nAnd 65 % of the population has a complete vaccination cycle .\nHowever , since the end of June 2021 , the number of new daily infections has risen from less than 500 to nearly 2000 .\nAs RTBF acknowledges , in the face of the Delta variant , current vaccination is far from sufficient to protect the population .\nSingapore abandons the hope of \u201c Zero Covid \u201d through vaccines This small country is also highly vaccinated and nearly 80 % of the population has received at least one dose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it has had to face an exponential resumption of the epidemic with an increase in cases from about ten in June to more than 150 at the end of July and 1246 cases on September 24 .\nThis uncontrolled recurrence of the disease despite vaccination has led to the abandonment of the strategy of eradicating the virus for a model of \u201c living with the virus \u201d by trying to treat the disease \u201c like the flu \u201c .\nIn the UK : a worrying rise in infections The United Kingdom is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with more than 70 % of the population vaccinated for the first time , and 59 % with a complete vaccination schedule .\nThis high \u201c vaccination \u201d rate did not prevent an explosion of cases at the beginning of the summer , with up to 60,000 new cases per day by mid-July .\nFaced with this significant resumption of the epidemic despite vaccination , Andrew Pollard , representative of the Oxford Vaccine Group , acknowledged before Parliament : \u201c collective immunity through vaccination is a myth \u201c .\nThis resumption of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hospitalizations , severe cases and deaths .\nAccording to the official report of August , [ 2 ] deaths were more frequent among fully vaccinated patients ( 679 ) than among non-vaccinated patients ( 390 ) , thus cruelly denying the hopes of a protective effect of the vaccine on mortality .\nAfter the last sanitary restrictions were lifted , the epidemic decreased to a level of less than 30,000 cases per day , whereas at the beginning of July , simulations by covid specialists were predicting up to 100,000 new cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed .\nIsrael , champion of the Pfizer injection , once everywhere cited as an example of effectiveness , is now being harshly reminded of reality and is now the model of vaccine failure .\n70 % of the population is primo-vaccinated , and nearly 90 % of those at risk have a complete vaccination cycle .\nBut the epidemic has rebounded stronger than ever since the end of June , and more than 11,000 new cases were recorded in 1 day ( September 14 , 2021 ) surpassing the peaks seen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first Pfizer injections by nearly 50 % .\nThis resumption of the epidemic , despite the Pfizer injections , is accompanied by an increase in hospitalizations where the vaccinated represent the majority of those hospitalized .\nVaccination does not protect against severe forms of the disease or against death .\nEnd of July : 71 % of the 118 seriously ill Israelis ( serious , critical ) were fully vaccinated !\nThis proportion of seriously ill people vaccinated is much higher than the proportion of fully vaccinated people : 61 % .\nTo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms of the disease , as the Israeli Minister of Health imprudently declared , is a mistake ( or disinformation ? )\n.\nIn order not to acknowledge its mistakes , the Israeli government remains in denial of this obvious failure and continues to propose only vaccination as a solution .\nHow many more deaths will it take before it follows the example of India or Japan and finally adopts early treatment ?\nThe current pseudo vaccines are not effective enough .\nThey do not prevent the recurrence of the epidemic , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death .\nIn Israel and Great Britain , which specify the vaccination status of the victims , the vaccinated suffer from an increased risk of mortality compared to the non-vaccinated .\nThe pursuit of a vaccine-only policy leads to a deadly impasse , whereas countries that officially advise early treatment ( India ) or allow their doctors to prescribe it ( Japan , Korea ) fare much better .\nWhat are our health authorities waiting for to stop believing in false simulations carried out by epidemiologists who are too closely linked to vaccine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts and to interrupt their deceptive and deleterious pro-vaccination campaign and recommend early treatment ?\nThe continuation of the ban on early treatment by treating physicians leads to a loss of chances for many patients and directly engages the responsibility of the government and particularly the Minister of Health .\nDr G\u00e9rard Del\u00e9pine is an

Harvard University , Brown University , and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation calculates how different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pandemic to date .\nThe findings reveal that government lockdown orders devastated workers at the bottom of the financial food chain but left the upper-tier actually better off .\nThe analysis examined employment levels in January 2020 , before the coronavirus spread widely and before lockdown orders and other restrictions on the economy were implemented .\nIt compared them to employment figures from March 31 , 2021 .\nThe picture painted by this comparison is one of working-class destruction .\nEmployment for lower-wage workers , defined as earning less than $ 27,000 annually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the time period .\nEmployment for middle-wage workers , defined as earning from $ 27,000 to $ 60,000 , declined by a modest 4.5 percent .\nHowever , employment for high-wage workers , defined as earning more than $ 60,000 , actually increased 2.4 percent over the measured time period despite the country \u2019 s economic turmoil .\nThe data are damning .\nThey offer yet another reminder that government lockdowns hurt most those who could least afford it .\nSome critics argue that the pandemic , not government lockdowns , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhile there \u2019 s no doubt the virus itself played some role , government lockdowns were undoubtedly the single biggest factor .\nIt \u2019 s pretty intuitive that ordering people not to patronize businesses and criminalizing peoples \u2019 livelihoods would hurt the economy .\nThis intuition is confirmed by data and studies showing as much .\nAnd don \u2019 t forget the fact that heavy lockdown states have consistently had much higher unemployment rates than states that took a more laissez-faire approach .\nOthers might insist that the mitigation of the spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic fallout .\nBut this argument fails to account for the many peer-reviewed studies showing lockdown orders did not effectively slow the pandemic \u2019 s spread , or the painfully inconvenient fact that most COVID-19 spread occurred not in workplaces , restaurants , or gyms but at home .\n( Making \u201c stay-at-home orders \u201d seem like an astonishing mistake in hindsight . )\nSo , all lockdowns really seem to have accomplished is at best a mild delay in the pandemic \u2019 s trajectory in exchange for a host of lethal unintended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and skyrocketing drug overdoses .\nAnd , as we now know , a highly regressive economic fallout for the working class .\nOf course , Ivy League

PCR tests , especially in the context of an alleged epidemic of national or pandemic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibility of a pseudo or testing epidemic .\nIn 2007 , the New York Times , virtually the bible of journalists whose integrity they still trusted at the time , publishes an important piece entitled : \u2018 Faith in Quick Test Leads to Epidemic That Wasn \u2019 t \u2019 .\nDr. Herndon , internist at a medical centre in the U.S. state of New Hampshire , coughs seemingly incessantly for a fortnight starting in mid-April 2006 .\nSoon , an infectious disease specialist has the disturbing idea that this could be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of April , other hospital staff are also coughing .\nSevere , persistent coughing is a leading symptom of whooping cough .\nAnd if it is whooping cough , the outbreak must be contained immediately because the disease can be fatal for babies in the hospital and lead to dangerous pneumonia in frail elderly patients .\nIt is the Start of a Bizarre Episode : the Story of an Epidemic that wasn \u2019 t .\nFor months , almost everyone involved believes there is a huge whooping cough outbreak at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,000 staff members are given a quick PCR test and put on leave from work until the results are in ; 142 people , 14.2 % of those tested , including Dr. Herndon , are positive on the quick PCR test and diagnosed with pertussis .\nThousands , including many children , receive antibiotics and a vaccine as protection .\nHospital beds are taken out of service as a precaution , including some in the intensive care unit .\nMonths later , all those apparently suffering from whooping cough are stunned to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard for pertussis , could not detect the bacterium that causes whooping cough in any single sample .\nThe whole insanity was a false alarm .\nThe supposed pertussis epidemic had not taken place in reality , but only in the minds of those involved , triggered by blind faith in a highly sensitive quick PCR test that had become , oh , so modern .\nIn truth , all those who had fallen ill had suffered from a harmlesscold .\nInfectiologists and epidemiologists had put aside their expertise and common sense and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the symptom cough .\nMany of the new molecular tests are quick but technically demanding .\nEach laboratory performs them in its own way as so-called \u2018 home brews \u2019 .\nOften they are not commerciallyavailable and there are rarely good estimates of their error rates .\nTheir high sensitivity makes false positives likely .\nWhen hundreds or thousands of people are tested , as happened here , false-positive results can give the appearance of an epidemic .\nAn infectiologist said , I had a feeling at the time that this gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it might be like during a pandemic flu epidemic .\nAnd an epidemiologist explained : One of the most troubling aspects of the pseudo-epidemic is that all the decisions seemed so sensible at the time .\nThe madness of a pseudo or testing epidemic had seemed perfectly normal to so many people involved .\nI recommend you read this article published in the New York Times in 2007 and ask yourself : \u201c Shouldn \u2019 t we all have learned a lot from this for the future ?\n\u201d As responsible physicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real epidemic of national or pandemic of international scope we must always remember previous alleged or real epidemics and pandemics .\nHere is the last allegedly serious pandemic : The swine flu scandal .\nIn spring 2009 , a highly contagious , very dangerous influenza virus , H1N1 , seems to threaten humanity .\nThe disease it causes is clinically indistinguishable from seasonal flu .\nIt is called swine flu .\nExperts like the German virologist Prof. Christian Drosten spread horror scenarios predicting millions of deaths worldwide .\nIn May , the WHO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for reasons that have never been explained .\nIt removes the dangerousness of the causative pathogen from the definition of a pandemic .\nNow , the rapid massive spread of a comparatively harmless pathogen over at least two WHO regions is enough .\nAny endemic , every seasonal wave of any flu or cold virus , no matter how harmless it is , can be called a pandemic .\nPromptly , the WHO declares an H1N1 pandemic on June 11th .\nPoliticians are taking seriously the warnings of the experts and the WHO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are procuring hundreds of millions of packages of sparsely effective , expensive antiviral drugs and hundreds of millions of doses of hastily approved vaccines which are , after all , produced using conventional methods .\nCritics , who describe the virus as comparatively harmless , are ridiculed or ignored initially .\nFinally , scientists , in Europe especially the German microbiologist and infection epidemiologist Prof. Sucharit Bhakdi , and the German pneumologist and politician Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg , gain media and political attention .\nThe global madness , already threatening at that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 150 000 to 600 000 people died with or from H1N1 , which turned out to be less dangerous than seasonal influenza .\nCorrespondingly , vaccination readiness was low .\nNevertheless , in Sweden alone , about 700 children contracted disabling narcolepsy , sleeping sickness , caused by hastily approved unnecessary and unsafe vaccines .\nIn Switzerland alone , 1.8 million vaccine doses were sold abroad or given away , and 8.9 million were disposed of .\nThere was hardly any media coverage of the swine flu scandal .\nThe temporary success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the interconnectedness of experts , the pharmaceutical industry , the WHO and health politicians .\nIn the end , the seemingly completely overwhelmed health authorities had fallen for an almost perfectly orchestrated propaganda campaign .\nI recommend you watch the documentary \u2018 Profiteers of Fear \u2013 The Swine Flu Business \u2019 , produced in German by Arte in November 2009 , and ask yourself : \u201c Shouldn \u2019 t we all have learned a lot from this for the future ?\n\u201d The situation is threatening .\nA new corona virus is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Johns Hopkins University dashboard are rising and rising .\nThe highly contagious , immune-resistant , dangerous virus is paralysing trade and transport globally and sending the world economy into free fall .\nWhat sounds like the alleged outbreak of the alleged pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 in China \u2019 s Wuhan province in December 2019 , is the scenario of \u2018 Event 201\u2032 , which , because the figure zero is actually a globe , should rather be called \u201c Event 21 \u201d .\nOn October 18th 2019 , Bill and Melinda Gates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Economic Forum are organising a pandemic simulation under this name .\nAfter the Spanish flu , the bird flu and the swine flu , they do not choose another influenza virus as the pathogen , but a corona virus that was completely unknown to laypeople so far , especially not to politicians and journalists .\nThis simulation of a corona pandemic that broke out in South America is not attended by doctors , but by Western representatives of the organisers , the UN , the WHO , governments , authorities and global corporations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pharmaceuticals , logistics , tourism and the media , as well as Dr George Gao , virologist and director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) ( see list of participants below ) The Event 201 Pandemic Exercise .\nOctober 18 , 2019 also addressed within the simulation how to deal with online social media and so-called \u201c misinformation \u201d .\n( Listen carefully ) The participants agree that a corona pandemic is disruptive , can only be overcome by global governmental and private cooperation , that system-relevant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while medium-sized businesses must be sacrificed if necessary , that voices who deviate from the prevailing narrative must be censored consistently in the social and mass media , and that the pandemic can only be terminated by vaccinating the entire world population .\n\u201c The entities directly or indirectly \u201c represented \u201d by the \u201c players

trusted at the time , with the title \u2018 Transmission of 2019-nCoV Infection from an Asymptomatic Contact in Germany \u2019 .\nOn February 11th , the WHO names the novel corona virus SARS-CoV-2 , the disease it causes COVID-19 ; coronavirus disease .\nIt does so against the request of Chinese virologists .\nThey preferred to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the danger that the name SARS-CoV-2 could stir up unfounded fears out of its biological and epidemiological lack of similarity to the much more dangerous SARS-CoV-1 .\nOn March 11th , the WHO declares a COVID pandemic .\nMeanwhile , its Director-General , the biologist , immunologist and philosopher Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , has been charged with genocide in Ethiopia before the International Criminal Court in The Hague .\nThe presumption of innocence applies , of course .\nNow , almost everything is going on as it did during the swine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an even more lubricated way .\nExperts , mostly laboratory physicians and biologists working as virologists or epidemiologists , who have never examined anyone suffering from a respiratory infection , let alone treated them , declare that SARS-CoV-2 is virtually an alien about which we know absolutely nothing and that we must regard as extremely dangerous , until largely the same experts will have proven otherwise at some point .\nIn Switzerland , they constitute themselves as \u2018 Swiss National COVID-19 Science Task Force \u2019 and offer themselves to the Swiss Federal Council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislative politicians as well as the federal and cantonal health authorities , all panicked by them , accept their offer and seem to follow them as blindly as the Federal Council apparently blindly followed the WHO when it declared the COVID pandemic .\nUnlike any ninepins club , the now official scientific advisory board to the Swissgovernment through what is supposed to be Switzerland \u2019 s biggest crisis since the Second World War does not keep any record of its activities .\nOn March 16th , the Swiss Federal Council declares the \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of the epidemic law , based on exactly zero scientific evidence .\nThe mass media , including the Swiss public service broadcaster SRG , take on the third part in this conglomerate of mutually escalating ignorance , arrogance , incompetence and organised irresponsibility .\nBrainless and heartless themselves , they hammer into our heads around the clock : There is a pandemic of a highly contagious and even epidemiologically relevant asymptomatically transmissible corona killer virus .\nEvery seemingly hale and hearty fellow human being can be your angel of death !\nUnlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ censor , discredit and defame questioning doctors and scientists , including luminaries such as John Ioannidis , Professor of medicine , epidemiology and public health at Stanford University School of Medicine , oneof the world \u2019 s most renowned and most cited scientists , specialised in science fraud , Prof. Sucharit Bhakdi , and Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg .\nAt Easter 2020 , after having been libelled , including an alleged threat to politicians and to my family , by a private person well known to me , myself , was brutally arrested by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after it immediately turned out that I had not threatened anyone , merely the world view of insane people , I was shipped off to a closed psychiatric ward for six days becauseof \u2018 self-endangerment while in COVID insanity \u2019 .\nThe governments of almost all countries seem to have forgotten their epidemic plans , which wisely spare the individuals , the society and the economy .\nIn blind obedience to the WHO and to lobbyists , called experts , they are enacting self-destructive non-pharmacological interventions , including lockdowns never considered before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThey are doing this almost globally , in lockstep .\nWithout consulting the population , they procure billions of doses of emergency mRNA and DNA injections , which are even temporarily approved by Swissmedic .\nThis technology is being widely used on humans for the first time .\nAlmost worldwide , the constitution , the rule of law , human rights , civil liberties , ethics , science and common sense are being sacrificed in favour of a quasi-global authoritarian regime under the control of the WHO .\nWho controls the WHO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corona narrative is this : Since early 2020 , there is a pandemic of a perennial killer virus , that must be searched for with the Corman-Drosten RT-PCR test in everybody , that is even spreading epidemiologically relevantly asymptomatically , against which there is no basic or cross-immunity , whose provoked disease , COVID-19 , is barely treatable , which is becoming increasingly infectious and dangerous due to erratic mutations , and which can only be overcome by non-pharmacological measures that have never been applied before , such as antisocial distancing , masks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isolation , quarantine , school closures and curfews , nowadays called lockdowns , even for asymptomatic , previously called healthy , people , and by serial vaccination of the entire world population .\nAll myths of the prevailing corona narrative are made up out of a fact-free vacuum Based on the current state of science , these are my top 10 .\n1 .\nThere has been no epidemic of COVID-19 of national scope in any country , no pandemic internationally , for the general population SARS-CoV-2 is not a killer virus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country .\nIn many countries , for example in Switzerland , there was no exceptional excess mortality when adjusted to changing demographics .\nThe excess mortality in other countries is the best proof that the real killer is not the virus , but our paradoxical response to it , which differs from country to country and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction .\nAlso , the occupancy of the intensive care units , whose capacities have been massively reduced in the course of the alleged pandemic , has never been unusually high .\nIf the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substituting the number of deceased from whatever cause within 28 days after a positive RT-PCR test with the number of deceased from COVID-19 , the infection fatality rate , IFR , is below that of influenza viruses , which are deadly to some people , of course , and , unlike SARS-CoV-2 , sometimes are also deadly to children .\n2 .\nThe indication to test , namely not only critically ill hospitalised patients with a need forspecific antiviral therapy , in the surveillance system for respiratory infections and in an epidemiological study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people and , on top of that , to test only for one single of all respiratory viruses that must be considered in the differential diagnosis of respiratory infections , is wrong .\n3 .\nThe Corman-Drosten RT-PCR test is neither diagnostic for an infection with SARS-CoV-2 nor for a sickness or death from COVID-19 .\nOn November 27th 2020 , an international group of 22 life scientists , including myself , published an \u2018 External Peer Review of the Corman-Drosten Paper \u2019 , the recipe by which laboratories developed the RT-PCR test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared that conflicts of interest existed , that the alleged peer review within 24 hours was absurd , and ten fundamental scientific flaws .\nThis most momentous medical publication of 2020 , which can hardly be surpassed in terms of lack of scientificity , should never have been published .\nThe Corman-Drosten RT-PCR test protocol is fabricated poorly and vaguely , without validation and standardisation .\nFrom a laboratory survey conducted in Germany , we know that due to cross-reaction with other beta coronaviruses its specificity of about 98.6 % , correspondingto 1.4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low in the absence of any virus , is further reducedto up to 92.4 % , corresponding to 7.6 % false positives , during the flu season .\nThese rates offalse positive tests may seem low to many laypeople and allegedly even to many \u2018 experts \u2019 , because they do not realise that in the virtual absence of the virus between the flu seasons , at prevalence close to 0 , almost all positive RT-PCR tests are false positives .\nPlease consider that if we test 1000 men with a 99 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 tests , will be positive and because of prevalence 0 of pregnancy in men , these positive pregnancy tests are all false positives .\nEverywhere , the test is performed differently and at too high cycle thresholds .\nAlthough studies have shown that no culturable viruses are present in samples with a Ct value above 28 , the tests are still carried out with cycle threshold values above 35 .\nTheir results are reported without reference to clinical symptoms and findings , worldwide .\nThe Corman-Drosten RT-PCR test is scientifically incorrect and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case numbers , a testing pandemic .\n4 .\nThere is no epidemiologically relevant asymptomatic transmission of respiratory viruses .\nWhat we learned in medical school has been confirmed also for SARS-CoV-2 by numerous peer reviewed studies .\nThe \u2018 asymptomatic contact \u2019 invented by Prof. Drosten in the Letter to the Editor of January 30th 2020 was very much symptomatic : the patient had suppressed her symptoms with medication .\nTherefore , all non-pharmacological interventions for asymptomatic , formerly called healthy , people beyond the proven effective measures to contain the spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-isolation of sick people , are harmful and ineffective also against SARS-CoV-2.5 .\nThereiseffectiveprophylaxis , for example , healthy lifestyle , lots of social contacts , and vitamin D3 , andthereiseffective , welltolerated , lowcosttherapyofCOVID-19 , for example , anti-inflammatory drugs , topical budesonide , hydroxychloroquine , ivermectin , and anticoagulants .\n6 .\nUnlike influenza viruses , SARS-CoV-2 does not mutate erratically , but slowly and permanently .\nFor this reason alone , even the most effective vaccines always lag behind its new variants .\n7 .\nSARS-CoV-2 is not becoming more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous .\nLike all other respiratory viruses , it obeys the laws of evolution .\nWithout human intervention , the variant that spreads most easily prevails .\nThat is why it is becoming more and more contagious indeed , but less and less dangerous , of course .\n8 .\nSARS-CoV-2 , like all viral pathogens of acute respiratory infections , does not occur perennially , but seasonally , in our mid-northern latitudes from November to April .\nWhat \u2018 experts \u2019 call the heroic overcoming of the pandemic of a killer virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole populace , we doctors call , the end of the flu season .\n9 .\nDue to basic and cross-immunity , during each flu season only about 10-20 % of the population contract the seasonal beta corona and influenza viruses .\nThis is also true for SARS-CoV-2 .\nAn \u2018 nth wave of a respiratory virus \u2019 is a biological impossibility .\nRather , the season of Corona-19 is followed by that of Corona-20 and now by that of Corona-21 , to which most people are partially cross-immune , at least .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ alleged killer virus SARS-CoV-2 can not be overcome by vaccinating the entire world population , including the immune or recovered .\nThe serial experimental mRNA and DNA injections are unnecessary because the IFR is 0.15 % , for less than 70-year-olds below 0.05 % , for children 0.00 % , and even much lower if the causes of death are established correctly , so below that of seasonal influenza .\nMoreover , SARS-CoV-2 is mutating permanently and always in the sense that it becomes more infectious while less dangerous .\nThe experimental foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already known this from the registration studies , which are not worth the paper they are written on .\nFor example , the mRNA injections reduced the risk of mild COVID-19 disease absolutely by less than 1 % .\nThere were no data for severe courses , for disease transmission and for over 75-year-old sick persons .\nTheir ineffectiveness has alsobeen proven in the real world by now .\nFinally , the gene injections are unsafe .\nThey can cause anaphylactic reactions , thromboembolism , thrombocytopenia , disseminated intravascular coagulation , and myocarditis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible immunosuppression and antibody-dependent enhancement , ADE , in the medium-term .\nAnd in the long term there are possible autoimmune diseases , cancer and infertility , risks that have not been ruled out yet .\nFurthermore , natural immunisation is stronger and more sustainable than the best vaccine , and immune or recovered people do neither need basic immunisation nor a booster .\nOr , if you had gone through measles , mumps andrubella as a child or had received the basic MMR immunization , did anyone ever recommend that you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time or again ?\nThe mainly testing pandemic present since the end of the 2020 flu season , at least , can only be overcome by ending the unscientific testing of even asymptomatic people .\nThese are the major myths of the prevailing corona narrative .\nWe doctors and scientists have not been allowed to debunk them publicly for over a year and a half .\nIf we dare to fulfil our moral duty , we are ignored and censored at best , libelled , banned or forcibly detained psychiatrically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second year , as medical students we had to study basic epidemiology .\nThere we learned that in the event of a possible epidemic of national scope , a study cohort representative of the population must be formed immediately .\nIts purpose is to monitor the prevalence , incidence , and severity of the disease and the status of immunity , here by testing for antibodies AND T-cell immunity .\nThus , in April 2020 we would already have realised that there was no epidemic of national scope , presumably that almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was exactly 0 scientific evidence for painful and costly nonsensical interventions , for the enactment of epidemic laws , for the draftingof COVID laws and for digital COVID certificates .\nAllegedly , no one in the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health ( FOPH ) and in its affiliated Swiss National COVID-19 Science Task Force has the knowledge of a second-year medical student .\nFor , although it is 20 months since the WHO declared the COVID pandemic , such a representative epidemiological surveillance cohort does not exist .\nEven worse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had also paused the surveillance systemof viral respiratory infections based on representative medical practices , thereby completing the blind flight in favour of total interpretive sovereignty of the arbitrarily manipulable useless RT-PCR test \u2018 case numbers \u2019 .\nDo not gloat .\nIt is the same shame in your country .\nIt is wrong to test symptomatic people for only one of all respiratory viruses .\nIt is insane to do this only with a hypersensitive , nonspecific RT-PCR test with cycle threshold above 35 , without considering number of cycles , symptomatology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more insane to mass test also asymptomatic , previously called healthy , people in this way .\nAnd it is the coronation of insanity to serially administer unnecessary , ineffective , unsafe experimental mRNA and DNA injections tothe entire world population , on top of that without regard to their immune status .\nShould this text seem too long or too complicated to you , please take a close look at this picture .\nat least : It paints a thousand words .\nJust a glance at near-real-time monitoring of intensive care occupancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2021 , exposes the fundamental fraud of the prevailing corona narrative .\nDuring each alleged wave happens the same .\nCompletely synchronously and to almost the same extent as the number of COVID patients , yellow curve , goes up , the number of non-COVID patients , green curve , goes down , although there are high reserves of intensive care beds , dashed curve , throughout the whole course of he alleged epidemic .\nAt the end of each alleged wave , the same thing happens in the opposite directions .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment a COVID patient enters an intensive care unit a supernatural entity is postponing non-emergency major surgery , another viral pneumonia , a bacterial or fungal pneumonia , a myocardial infarction , a central pulmonary embolism , a cerebral stroke , or a major car accident with numerous serious injuries .\nOr , on admission to hospital every patient is tested for SARS-CoV-2 using the RT-PCR test , which is unsuitable for diagnostic purposes \u2013 rolling a dice would be cheaper .\nAccording to the test result , he or she is assigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the yellow , COVID patients , curve , in short : other diagnoses areoften mislabelled as COVID-19 .\nThis fraud occurs not so much in the intensive care units themselves , as rather in the direct reporting by the laboratories to the FOPH , which reports these and all other meaningless \u201c case numbers \u201d to the mass media , who then bombard us with them around the clock .\nSince April 2020 , at least , the total number of ICU patients , black curve , changes little due to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt also explains why the intensive care units were not overloaded in any country , regardless of whether there are almost three times as many ICU beds per capita , for example in Germany , or only about half as many , for example in Sweden , as in Switzerland .\nThose responsible must have known this .\nOtherwise they would not have cut ICU capacity worldwide since April 2020 , in Switzerland from over 1500 to under 900 , but would have built up more .\nInstead of redistributing 100 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle to the very top , I would have recommended to my government investing a fraction of it in recruiting retired and in increasing the workload of part-time ICU staff .\nI guess the coming so-called 5th wave will be very similar to the so-called 2nd wave during the last flu season with the usual hump in the total number of ICU patients , black curve , due to more frequent severe acute respiratory infections during every flu season .\nI wish that the alleged \u2018 killer variant \u2019 Omicron is natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but less dangerous than the alleged \u2018 killer variant \u2019 Delta , and that there will not be many very severe COVID cases due to ADE , and not too many very severe adverse events of the experimental mRNA and DNA injections .\nShould you have a better explanation for the almost perfect symmetry of the yellow and green curves with an imaginary mirror axis located between the two , I will be the first to examine it closely and publicly apologize for my , then fake news .\nSARS-CoV-2 is not an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the well-known beta corona virus family .\nFrom my allegedly crazed cardiologist \u2019 s view , this is the prevailing corona nonsense narrative .\nAn endemic of a seasonal beta corona cold virus , that may kill some people , of course , and becomes increasingly harmless through permanent slow mutation , has been inflated into a pandemic of a perennial killer virus , which is becoming ever more dangerous through erratic mutations , with PR , PCR , frightening masks , and the myth of epidemiologically relevant asymptomatic transmission , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmful non-pharmacological interventions even for asymptomatic , formerly called healthy , people and with serial unnecessary , ineffective , unsafe experimental mRNA and DNA injections of the entire world population .\nIf you still do not realise that this is , pardon , utter nonsense , from A for epidemiologically relevant Asymptomatic transmission to Z for Zero COVID , I am afraid I can \u2019 t help you either and this German proverb comes to my mind , translated into English : The greater the damage of the roof , the more beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still prevailing corona nonsense narrative justifies the globally dominating unscientific , inhumane madness .\nSuch can be wrought with any respiratory virus , by the way : if we no longer test everybody with a hypersensitive , low-specific RT-PCR test , that cross-reacts with other viruses , for theoretically one RNA fragment of SARS-CoV-2 , but for one of , say , influenza or metapneumo viruses , we immediately have an influenza or metapneumo virus testing pandemic .\nThe alleged pandemic is mainly an unreal PCR testing pandemic , but the totalitarian repressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they threaten our freedom , our livelihoods and even our lives .\nPlease remember the Hippocratic Oath , \u2018 Primum non nocere , secundum cavere , tertium sanare \u2019 ; \u2018 First do no harm , second be careful , third heal \u2019 , and the Geneva Declaration of the World Medical Association , especially \u2018 I will not use my medical knowledge to violate human rights and civil liberties , even under threat !\nFinally help to end this total insanity , first and foremost by no longer applying unnecessary , ineffective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by reporting all their adverse events .\nThen the corona house of nonsense cards will immediately collapse .\nWake up , stand up and vote against the unscientific , unconstitutional , unlawful , inhumane , insane COVID law , for you , for your loved ones and for the whole human family , today !\nWake up , stand up and fight , peacefully but firmly ; if not for yourself , then for your children \u2019 s future and that of your grandchildren , now !\nThis article was originally published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Humanismus 2020 .\nDr. Thomas Binder

were trampling on the civil rights of their subjects due to a viral strain with a better than 99 percent survival rate , Russian lawmakers adopted \u2013 and without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # 1248305-7 that

a time when the world is struggling against a Western invasion of \u2018 progressive \u2019 thought that is totally at odds with what defines a healthy and sane state .\nThat is not to suggest that

progressive tendencies that have begun devouring Western capitals .\nAnd as most people can appreciate , ideas have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the internet \u2013 for national borders , nor do they require passports .\nIn the not-so-distant past , most people \u2013 at least among the mentally stable \u2013 would agree that pedophilia is a crime of the highest magnitude against society \u2019 s most vulnerable members .\nNowadays , such a statement of \u2018 certainty \u2019 finds no shortage of cynical detractors .\nAlthough the Western world has not come out and pledged its allegiance to child

things stand , public libraries are proudly hosting ( taxpayer funded ) Drag Queen Story Hours ; a 13-year-old transgender boy named \u2018 Desmond is Amazing \u2019 is touted in the media as the ideal role model for children ; and medical practitioners are strongly discouraged from challenging those children who say they want to \u2018 transition \u2019 to the opposite sex , a decision

children can make critical life decisions for themselves \u2013 up to and including what sex they may identify as ( an incredibly complicated and unproven concept that is oftentimes planted in young

enter into sexual relations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other words , there is no longer any need for parental guidance , it is believed , in this bizarre new world order .\nThe mainstream media , Hollywood , public schools and social media have taken over the shop .\nThis slow-drip indoctrination process has been gathering momentum for a long time in various publications .\nIn 2017 , for example , BBC ran with an article entitled , \u2018 Paedophiles need help , not condemnation \u2013 I should know.\n\u2019 Here the reader is introduced to an anonymous 60-something male who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It \u2019 s a

childhood.\n\u201d Did you catch it ?\nThe author has said that pedophilia , as opposed to being a mental affliction , is yet another harmless \u201c sexual orientation.\n\u201d Just so we \u2019 re

between \u2018 victim \u2019 and \u2018 martyr \u2019 .\nIn any case , it is clear where this game of linguistic gymnastics of turning predators into victims is heading .\nThe world must stand firm

decides to grind the wheels the engine comes to a halt The sum of all fears for the average Russian has just been averted .\nThe large packet of totalitarian answers to a problem of questionable magnitude has been booted from the State Duma .\nThere has been an air of dread amongst the populace who were waiting to see if nationwide QR-code legislation would make it into law destroying their lives and businesses to separate those vaccinated from plague ridden riff raff .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hegelian Dialectic gamesmanship would get a watered down , but still crushing version of this system passed .\nThankfully for the sake of the Russian economy and sanity itself this is now not to be .\nThis decision to completely bail on a QR Code apartheid not only comes at an interesting moment in history but has great relevance for Russia itself and issues related to Covid-19 on a global scale .\nScreenshot : From the official Instagram account of the State Duma : \u201c The Council of the State Duma unanimously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration \u201d .\nInterestingly the text says the next big law under consideration is about \u201c punishing pedophiles \u201d even more harshly .\nWhy was the public so concerned over this , shouldn \u2019 t we fight Covid-19 ?\nThere was a sort of test run of this QR code system in Moscow .\nIt didn \u2019 t last very long and from the onset it was clear that the Russian masses were not going to let laws get in the way of their daily activities as is tradition .\nAny filtration processes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused a complete transport collapse and lasted around 48 hours in total .\nThe boiled down version of this idea mostly applied to restaurants which were forced to check guests for having a vaccination code .\nThere was much resistance to this , and certain crafty restaurateurs saw the value of convincing the government that they were enforcing QR code restrictions while just letting anyone through the door anyways .\nAfter Putin came back from one of his trips abroad , this system , which was ever so critical for our safety , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly left a bad taste in the public \u2019 s mouth and many bankrupt restaurants .\nLater a similar project was put into place in Tatarstan with even more violently resisted results .\nPerhaps if this were to have happened on a national level in one clean sweep it could have broken the Russian economy .\nThe QR madness in Moscow/Tatarstan from St. Petersburg to Vladivostok would have been vastly more devastating than all of Washington \u2019 s sanctions packages combined .\nPerhaps it was a wise choice for a certain President to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d issue and repeatedly reaffirm that vaccination is a personal choice .\nSo why did this happen now ?\nPeople have been asking me for quite some time about the reality of anti-Covid measures here in Russia and what the government is doing .\nThe problem is that to understand today \u2019 s Russia you simply can not think of the state as a monolithic block .\nThere is no Putin dictatorship under a crushing cult of personality with all roads to power leading to an often shirtless God-Emperor .\nRussia is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a massive unseen war going on behind the walls of government institutions over the pandemic , which explains why Covid policies here have come and gone seemingly at random in various regions .\nEven at the macro level , there has been a soft push ( with the threat of a hard push ) for vaccination and yet Putin himself a few weeks ago said something very important about the Omicron Strain\u2026 \u201c Although they say it ( Omicron ) is not so harmful , some experts even call it live vaccination .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ get ahead of ourselves \u201d .\nIn political terms this seemed like a big call to just let the whole Covid situation go while having the ability to retract this statement in a few weeks if necessary .\nIt is also a very Russian answer to a problem for things to just magically work themselves out on their own .\nFor those conspiratorially minded it is interesting that this self-vaccinating Omicron Variant of Covid-19 that Putin brought to public attention is accused of being artificially created by the Mainstream Media .\nThis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nGoing further into the realm of conspiracy , there could be a connection between the absolute failure of negotiations between Russia and the U.S. and finally dropping this QR code legislation .\nRussia got nothing that it wanted from the Globalists so maybe the Globalists are going to get nothing from Russia ?\nMoscow \u2019 s participation in the big school play may be over for good .\nWhat does this mean for Russia ?\nBoth sides of the Covid fight in Russia have done a good job of building up enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other .\nWhen one side wins in this type of scenario we can all guess what is going to happen next .\nThere could be some major restructuring and firings coming up within the next year as revenge time is surely nigh .\nFor the Russian masses this will show that being obstinate pays off .\nVery often people of questionable intelligence vastly overestimate the ability of the individual to make change in society , but one thing the individual can do is resist , and when the majority of the population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to a halt .\nThe more collective mindset of Russians has saved the day and the Russian cultural traits of complete disregard for rules and brutal obstinacy have been revalidated for another generation .\nWhat does this mean in the context of Covid-19 globally ?\nThere is now a major nation that has essentially given up on anti-Covid measures .\nIt is also a global player with some significant media and internet presence that can advertise this fact .\nWhile Australians are being beaten and gassed for not wearing a mask at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the world how great it is that they defeated Covid using measures that had a minimal impact on the rights of citizens and now everything is back to the Old Normal .\nThey may even broadcast the whole notion that Omicron is a passive solution to the problem and that there is no threat .\nThis will make Russia become even more attractive to Western Conservatives and we should expect a wave of anti-vaxxer immigration to the land of bears and snow .\nYou may scoff at this notion , but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , things look a lot different .\nBut of course , if Russia completely drops its war on Covid , that will mean that Russians will suddenly present a \u201c danger \u201d to the populations of foreign nations and may be banned from traveling to most if not all of the West regardless of vaccination .\nAnd going to Russia as a Westerner could mean the death of your travel future as you \u2019 ve been tainted by their lack of anti-Covid measures .\nThat may sound insane but it is bureaucratically logical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever devolving Monopolar vs. Multipolar conflict that we are all in

Trojan Horse", "content": "As the west continues to slide inexorably towards a dystopian economic and societal abyss , its people still fail to recognise the true enemy , Eamon McKinney writes .\nThe concept of Oligarchy is not new , it dates back to the days of Aristotle and before .\nRule by a wealthy rich and powerful minority goes back to the earliest recorded civilisations .\nThis pernicious and often obscured ruling class have long exercised power over the political and governing institutions , nominally presumed to represent the interests of the majority .\nBy virtue of wealth or birth , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the majority and loot any surplus produced by their lessers .\nFor the international capital class the creation of an Oligarchical elite is an essential component of any plan to infiltrate and corrupt existing political institutions .\nThe European banking elite could gain little traction in the young United States .\nThe founding fathers , in particular Thomas Jefferson and John Adams , had dealt with them as they attempted to raise funds for their War of Independence , they quickly came to understand the game .\nThe Declaration of Independence was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class as it was of King George and the Monarchy .\nThe powers that be were threatened by America \u2019 s bad example , and a constitution that declared , \u201c all men are created equal \u201d was bound to elicit a negative response from those who thought they ruled the world .\nThe then dominant British empire never forgave the upstart Americans and embarked on a century long war of capitalist revenge .\nThe creation of an American Oligarchy was how the banking elite dragged America back under control of the European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Robber Barons \u201d , Rockefeller in oil , Carnegie in steel , Harriman in railroads and J.P. Morgan in banking , and many other monopoly capitalists , were all covertly financed by London banks .\nIt took this nascent Oligarchy a few years , but in 1913 they managed to pass the unconstitutional Federal Reserve Act .\nThe American money system was now in the control of the European bankers , where it remains to this day .\nThis was the point when America became the very thing it was established to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American dream , became just that , a myth .\nToday the American Oligarchs are not in steel or railroads , they are in finance and tech , all essential components of complete societal control .\nThe \u201c charismatically challenged \u201d Bill Gates is such a creation .\nFunded by the national security state he had the financial backing to ensure Microsoft obtained a virtual monopoly over the global software business .\nUnknown was that his software contained backdoors accessible to U.S. security agencies that they may spy on the world .\nBill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world on vaccines and health while concurrently pushing his de-population agenda .\nThe equally odious Mark Zuckerberg is a more recent version of this same phenomena .\nIn recent years , the term Oligarch has often been preceded by \u201c Russian \u201d .\nWhen the Soviet Union collapsed in 1989 it presented the capital class with the opportunity of a lifetime .\nThe vast Russian landscape was abundant in oil , gas and other natural resources .\nThe Russian state sector , inefficient and bankrupt , was particularly ripe for plunder .\nSeemingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Russian \u201c businessmen \u201d who began to buy up , for pennies of the dollar , distressed state sector assets .\nThese newly aspiring western-backed Oligarchs looted the country of their birth with impunity and without compunction .\nThrough these proxies the Neo-liberal west feasted greedily on the Russian corpse .\nIn Francis Fukuyama \u2019 s book the \u201c End of History \u201d , he declared the west had won , the Cold War was over , and Neo-liberalism reigned supreme .\nNot so fast\u2026 Assumed to be another corrupt aspiring Oligarch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the west when he ran for the Russian presidency .\nPutin insinuated that it would be \u201c business as usual \u201c if he became president , that was sufficient reassurance for the West and he was elected Russian president in 2000 .\nHowever , it transpired that Vlad was neither corrupt nor an aspiring Oligarch , he was in fact a fiercely patriotic Russian nationalist who despised what the West had done to Russia and was determined to reverse it .\nOf specific ire were the Russian traitors who had so callously raped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blighted people .\nPutin summoned the eighteen most prominent Oligarchs and laid down the law .\nThey could keep a portion of their ill-gotten gains , but they would pay tax , and they would not influence or interfere with the political process .\nMany took it onboard and fled Russia for the safe , Oligarch-friendly haven of London and stayed out of Russian affairs .\nNot all however , Mikhail Khodorkovsky continued to meddle , and Putin , true to his word , put him in jail .\nPutin had fooled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian people , and the West hasn \u2019 t forgiven him and since then Russia has been subject to every trick in the playbook of revenge capitalism .\nUnder Putin , Russia has regained its status as a great power .\nHis popularity with the Russian people is due to their understanding of the forces he is battling .\nChina , while enjoying its spectacular rise from the ashes of its western-imposed \u201c century of shame \u2019 has been fighting the same forces of \u201c money power \u201d as Putin \u2019 s Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mega tech conglomerate Alibaba discovered how seriously China is on the subject .\nJust prior to Alibaba \u2019 s long anticipated IPO , Jack felt emboldened enough to criticise the Chinese state banking system .\nHis IPO was cancelled and he was advised to go live quietly somewhere and enjoy his money , he has wisely done so .\nIn fact , Jack Ma is just a creation , a front for the rich and powerful Jiang family faction from Shanghai

Truck Drivers : What Canada Needs Is the \u201c Political Quarantine \u201d of Justin Trudeau A mass movement against the Covid mandate is unfolding coast to coast across Canada in solidarity with cross-border truck drivers .\nTens of thousands of people will be joining the truck drivers in Ottawa .\nAccording to Justin Trudeau , unvaccinated truck drivers \u201c may pose a risk of transmitting COVID-19 to the general public \u201d .\nWhat nonsense .\nTruck drivers for the most part stay in their truck , perform administrative duties and supervise loading and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have limited contact with people .\nAll cross-border truckers will \u201c need to be vaccinated in order to avoid a 14-day quarantine \u201d , says Justin Trudeau .\nIs it relevant to the Freedom Convoy in solidarity with the truck drivers ?\nThe Prime Minster demands that the truck drivers be vaccinated .\nHas Justin been vaccinated ?\nCheck it out and decide for yourself : There are indications , yet to be fully confirmed , that Prime Minister Trudeau has not been vaccinated .\n( See video , testimony and analysis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lifeline of Our National Economy Successive Canadian governments have protected the structures of cross-border North-American trade .\nAnd now Justin Trudeau has sucked us up into the biggest economic mess in our country \u2019 s history , while violating the fundamental rights of Canadians .\nWhat we need here in Canada is an indefinite \u201c political quarantine \u201d of our not so illustrious Prime Minister .\nI can say as an economist that this irresponsible decision by the Trudeau government ( which is ongoing ) will have devastating impacts on producers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as on the entire fabric of wholesale and retail trade .\nIt will affect all of us .\nThere is evidence that cross-border trade is being deliberately undermined .\nThis policy mandate is already creating shortages of essential goods including food , fuel and pharmaceuticals .\nIt will also affect the delivery of essential commodities shipped via the US from China , the European Union and Latin America .\nWe must ensure that cross-border US-Canada-Mexico trade be fully restored .\nAll the covid-19 mandates must be duly suspended .\nWe must confront and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWe must initiate dialogue involving the truck drivers , the owners of transport companies , law enforcement officials , customs officials on both sides of the border , producers , wholesalers , retailers .\nThe government will say : We are committed to saving lives , to protect people against V the virus .\nWhat utter nonsense .\nThey are manipulating cross-border trade .\nThe are destroying people \u2019 s lives .\nThe Trudeau government is corrupt .\nThis far-reaching decision was taken on behalf of powerful financial interests .\nIts unspoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bankruptcies .\nIt is important that government Covid-19 mandates and restrictions be lifted and that cross-border trade be protected and sustained .\nThe various Covid mandates have been used to spearhead the fear campaign and encourage Canadians to take their booster vaccine dose .\nWhile the media repeats ad nauseam that the virus is more dangerous than the vaccine , the devastating impacts of the mRNA vaccine are now confirmed beyond doubt .\nOfficial figures of reported vaccine-related deaths are routinely published by the US , UK and EU .\nThey are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the statement by Doctors for Covid Ethics .\nAccording to the latest report by VAERS : \u201c There have been more deaths , more permanent disabilities , and more hospitalizations following the experimental COVID-19 vaccines [ in the US ] , than there have been following all FDA-approved vaccines for the previous 31 years combined.\n\u201d Moreover the devastating impacts of the vaccine are now confirmed by a Confidential Report by Pfizer released in November as part of a Freedom of Information ( FOI ) procedure .\nThe data on deaths and adverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document are now in the public domain .\nThey did not want us to read it : What is contained in Pfizer \u2019 s \u201c confidential \u201d report is detailed evidence on the impacts of the \u201c vaccine \u201d on mortality and morbidity .\nThis data which emanates from the \u201c Horse \u2019 s Mouth \u201d can now be used to confront as well formulate legal procedures against Big Pharma , the governments , the WHO and the media .\nThis is a de facto Mea Culpa on the part of Pfizer .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe Freedom Convoy Initiative focusses on the broader policy context , with a view to confronting the Trudeau government and repealing the Covid-19 narrative and its various policy mandates including the mRNA vaccine .\nThis movement must not be sidetracked .\nIt must focus on the immediate repeal of the mRNA vaccine , which has resulted in an upward trend in mortality and morbidity .\nIt is essential to dispel the lies .\nThe RT-PCR test which is used by the governments to justify their policy mandates has now been declared invalid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( which called for its withdrawal in the US effective December 31 , 2021 ) .\nAll the data pertaining to so-called \u201c Covid Confirmed Cases \u201d resulting from the PCR test are totally meaningless .\nIn November 2021 , 94 million rapid home test kits ( self testing and antigen testing kits ) were delivered and distributed to the provinces , and another 140 million were ordered by the federal government in early January at a cost of 1.7 billion dollars .\nCanada has a population of 38.5 million and we now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have indelibly contributed in the course of the last two months to pushing up so-called Covid-19 positive cases .\nThis has created havoc in families across Canada .\nThe fear campaign has gone into high gear .\nIronically , the antigen and self testing kits recommended by Health Canada are categorized as less reliable than the PCR test which is now upheld as \u201c the gold standard \u201d .\nThe PCR test is totally dysfunctional .\nIt does not detect or identify SARS-CoV-2 .\nAll those figures on \u201c Covid-19 confirmed cases \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK , US , EU ) on reported vaccine related deaths and adverse events are REAL .\nCanada \u2019 s Freedom Convoy : First Step towards the Development of a Broad Based Grassroots Movement The Freedom Convoy movement is now supported by people from more than 65 countries .\nTruck drivers in Australia will be sending a convoy to Canberra on the 31st of January .\nMore than 60,000 truck drivers from the United States including 15,000 from California will be crossing the border and meeting up in Ottawa for this important event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 77 % of Canadians have voted in support of the Freedom Convoy in support of the truck drivers .\n( out of 17,698 votes cast ) .\nThe original source of this article is Global Research", "author": "Guest Author", "url":

\u2019 s biggest cities to blast horns all weekend long .\nThe ongoing border blockade and standoff between truckers and RCMP in Coutts , Alberta was shaken up today when Rebel News initially reported that the truckers had decided to relocate their convoy to Edmonton .\nThe truckers reversed the decision after a vote , however , deciding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ongoing blockade of the Canada \u2013 Montana border crossing .\nChad Williamson , the lawyer representing the truckers in Coutts , explained to Rebel News that tensions with the RCMP had cooled down significantly .\n\u201c There \u2019 s different levels of government that we are dealing with , \u201d Williamson said .\n\u201c We will continue to be in touch with the Department of Justice and members of the RCMP to monitor what is

by reiterating the calls of truckers all over Canada and the world , saying that he hopes their protests result in the lifting of mandates and a return to the freedom that we have all been asking for .\nIn Ottawa , the truckers and their supporters remained on Wellington Street today to continue their ongoing and peaceful protests against the federal government \u2019 s vaccine mandates and other COVID restrictions .\nSupporters were seen playing hockey in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few of the players stopped to talk with True North to discuss how they felt about the Ottawa police contemplating the

Holocaust survivor Vera Sharav described the striking parallels between what she witnessed as a child in Nazi-controlled Romania , and COVID policies being enacted today by governments around the

canceled because police threatened protesters , Sharav and other rally speakers gave their speeches at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Holocaust is that genocide was facilitated by global silence , indifference and the failure to intervene .\nThe Holocaust was set in motion when personal freedom , legal rights and civil rights were swept aside .\nThe author Primo Levi , an Italian Jewish survivor of Auschwitz , warned : \u201c It happened .\nTherefore it can happen again .\nIt can happen everywhere.\n\u201d As a Holocaust survivor , I am appalled by poseurs who control the Holocaust narrative .\nThey deny the relevance of the Holocaust to current discrimination and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigilantes censor and silence those who speak out .\nBy denying the relevance of the Holocaust to current repression , the vigilantes are Holocaust deniers .\nElie Wiesel , an Auschwitz survivor and Nobel laureate , was regarded as the victims \u2019 voice .\nHe stated : \u201c Indifference and the silence of people led to the Holocaust .\nTo remain silent and indifferent is the greatest sin of all.\n\u201d Today , survivors are shaken by the fear-mongering , and divisive , discriminatory measures against a minority .\nHorrifying scenes include police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European cities , in Australia , and , yes , in Israel .\nThese are painful reminders of the prelude to the Holocaust in which the Nazis : \u2022 Used the psychological weapons of fear and propaganda to impose a genocidal regime .\n\u2022 Demonized Jews as the spreaders of disease and the cause of their misery .\n\u2022 Destroyed their social conscience in the name of public health .\nToday \u2019 s predators are also using fear and propaganda to maintain a state of anxiety and helplessness .\nThe objective \u2014 then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition people to become obedient and to follow directives without question .\nThe global assault on our freedoms and our right to self-determination is facilitated by the weaponization of medicine .\nThen and now , the medical establishment has provided a veneer of legitimacy to mass medical murder .\nThe Nazis declared disabled people \u2014 \u201c unfit for life.\n\u201d The 1,000 German infants and young children who were the world \u2019 s first medical murder victims were actually murdered in hospitals .\nIn 2020 , global governments declared an emergency and issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered not to treat the elderly in nursing homes .\nThe result was mass medical murder \u2014 which Sweden called \u201c active euthanasia.\n\u201d \u2022 UK hospitals used lethal doses of the drug Midazolam to medically murder the elderly \u2014 a drug they continue to stockpile .\n\u2022 U.S. hospital guidelines still call for the elderly to receive minimal treatment .\n\u2022 Doctors in Western Europe and the U.S. are forbidden to prescribe existing , licensed , safe and effective , life-saving treatments for COVID patients .\nToday , humanity is threatened by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The real virus that continues to infect these predators is Eugenics .\nA report by the U.S. Commission on the Holocaust , chaired by Elie Wiesel , noted : \u201c \u2026 the inclination to duplicate the Nazi option and once again exterminate millions of people remains a hideous threat.\n\u201d The modern-day Nazis \u2019 objective is global population reduction .\nThe global oligarchs are determined to gain absolute control of the world \u2019 s resources \u2014 natural , financial and human .\nBill Gates , a lifelong eugenicist and major stakeholder in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the \u201c final solution.\n\u201d COVID injections use an experimental , gene transfer technology .\nIts testing on the global population is in gross violation of the foremost human right to \u201c voluntary , informed consent.\n\u201d Those who refuse to be injected are vilified as spreaders of a deadly virus .\nThey are subjected to increasingly harsh penalties and discrimination .\nGermany , Austria and Italy are once again swept up by an orgy of fascist hate-mongering .\nThis time the unvaccinated are being targeted .\nThe claimed rationale for vaccine mandates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmitting infection .\nHowever , the incontrovertible evidence shows that COVID injections do not prevent infection or its transmission and they do not provide immunity .\nEven the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2019 s director , Rochelle Wallensky , has acknowledged that COVID jabs can not prevent transmission .\nAlbert Bourla , Pfizer CEO , conceded that \u201c two doses of the vaccine offers very limited protection \u2014 if any.\n\u201d If vaccinated people can get infected and spread COVID \u2014 why are they privileged ?\nWhy are the unvaccinated \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinically worthless product \u2014 maligned , discriminated against , threatened with job loss , and the withdrawal of their children \u2019 s schooling ?\nIf COVID injections do not protect anyone \u2019 s health , what is the real objective of vaccine mandates and digital passports ?\nMany independent scientists are warning that these injections are biological weapons of mass destruction .\nTens of thousands of doctors , scientists and nurses refuse the injections \u2014 even if it means losing their jobs and their licenses .\nGovernment data from the UK , Israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European Medicines Agency ] confirm that massive deaths and injuries have been reported .\nClose to 38,000 Europeans have died following the shots .\nAnd more than 3,390,000 have suffered injuries .\nHealthy , athletic , young adults have died .\nChildren are suffering from myocarditis and blood clots .\nNeurodegenerative diseases are also emerging in the vaccinated .\nWe are at a catastrophic junction in human

holdout of Freedom Convoy truckers blockading their downtown , the Canadian Armed Forces have been quick to say they will be doing no such thing .\nA spokesperson for the Minister of Defence told the Wall Street Journal on Thursday , \u201c The Canadian Armed Forces are not involved in law enforcement in this situation , and there are no plans for such CAF involvement.\n\u201d Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also said Thursday that a military response is \u201c not in the cards right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very , very cautious before deploying military forces in situations engaging Canadians , \u201d he said .\n( First Reading would also recommend caution before deploying the military against non-Canadians . )\nThere have only been two prior incidents in modern times of the Canadian military being called in to quell civil unrest .\nThe first , the 1970 October Crisis , actually worked great at stamping out Quebec separatist terrorism .\nBut the sight of armed soldiers detaining even peaceful Quebec nationalists en masse has always been a mark on the legacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second , the 1990 Oka Crisis , had a much more checkered legacy .\nThe military did eventually compel a Mohawk-led protest to stand down their blockade of a disputed golf course expansion , but the whole thing was so messy it \u2019 s mostly become a template for what not to do .\nThe experience of Oka is arguably a key reason why Canadian law enforcement is hesitant to bring the hammer down on blockades of any kind \u2013 even when they completely seize the country \u2019 s rail lines for days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military talk started only because Ottawa Police chief Peter Sloly said Wednesday \u201c there may not be a policing solution to this demonstration \u201d and that \u201c we \u2019 re looking at every single option , including military aid to civil power .\n\u201d Freedom Convoy still refuses to leave until Ottawa meets their not tremendously realistic demand of ending all COVID strictures ( even the ones that Ottawa didn \u2019 t impose ) .\nAnd thus Downtown Ottawa effectively remains closed , with businesses shuttered ( including the 200-store Rideau Centre ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ core .\nThus far , aside from arresting the occasional violent protester , the primary law enforcement response has been the issuing of traffic tickets , which police said would continue daily .\nMeanwhile , Torontonians are worrying that their downtown will be the next to fall victim to an invasion of big rigs that refuse to leave .\nSo far , the only evidence of a Toronto demonstration is a series of flyers circulating online calling for a convoy to blockade the Ontario Legislation Assembly starting on Saturday , although it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how Freedom Convoy started .\nRather than attempt to deter such a thing , Ontario Premier Doug Ford simply asked them to be peaceful .\n\u201c If people want to come down and protest , God bless them , \u201d he said .\nFreedom Convoy is technically polling higher than the Liberal Party of Canada right now .\nA new Abacus Data poll found that 32 per cent of Canadians \u201c have a lot in common with the protesters and how they see things.\n\u201d That \u2019 s not a lot , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polling at just 28.2 per cent if an election were to be held tomorrow .\nAnother interesting takeaway from the Abacus Poll ?\nOf Green Party supporters , 57 per cent are on board with the truckers .\nGoFundMe has suspended Freedom Convoy \u2019 s official online fundraiser after it hit $ 10 million .\nThe reason ?\n\u201c We strictly prohibit user content that reflects or promotes behavior in support of violence , \u201d wrote GoFundMe in a statement .\nIf you \u2019 re a convoy supporter , this is probably where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ didn \u2019 t feel the need to do anything of the sort in prior Canadian protests that tore down statues or used heavy equipment to strand a bunch of pipeline workers in the middle of nowhere amidst historic flooding .\nArguably a more consequential convoy blockade ( at least from an economic standpoint ) is the one backing up cross-border trade at the Coutts , Alta .\nborder crossing .\nOn Wednesday the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation weighed in on the blockade , asking authorities to arrest participants as per The Critical Infrastructure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2020 with the intention of barring a recent spate of Indigenous-led blockades of highways and rail lines .\n\u201c If this blockade was being organized by Indigenous people , we have no doubt that authorities would respond quickly , \u201d they wrote .\nJamil Jivani was in these pages just a couple days ago alleging that he got fired from Bell Media for being the wrong kind of black ( the conservative kind ) .\nIn a new op-ed for the National Post , Jivani concludes that O \u2019 Toole \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good clue as to what got him kicked out .\nRather than attempt to give official voice to a grassroots movement spurred by \u201c government overreach , \u201d Jivani wrote that he chose to entertain \u201c the mainstream media narrative and focus on the handful of negative images being used to define thousands of Canadians as extremists.\n\u201d With one conservative leader already hitting the dust this week , Alberta right-wingers are wondering whether they should bag a second one .\nIt \u2019 s no secret that Alberta Premier Jason Kenney is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now due to his government \u2019 s COVID response ( basically , left-wingers think he hasn \u2019 t done enough , while right-wingers think he \u2019 s a Trudeau-esque lockdown tyrant ) .\nChallengers within and without Kenney \u2019 s United Conservative Party are now looking to have another go at removing him from the top job .\n\u201c O \u2019 Toole \u2019 s failure is Kenney \u2019 s failure .\nIt \u2019 s time for the UCP caucus to do the right thing and finish what the CPC caucus began , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a former UCP MLA who was kicked out of caucus due to his criticism of the government \u2019 s COVID response .", "author": "Guest Author", "url":

her .\nThese days , I think I know how she must have felt .\nBut above the din of jabbering jackanapes , pontificating poltroons and pseudo-experts , the truth can still be heard , if you listen for it .\nSo , listen .\nOnce again , Casandra is reviled , and Pollyannas rule the day .\nOne purports to tell us that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 \u201c a peaceful transition \u201d .\nAnother , in spite of all the evidence , says Russia \u2019 s absolutely irrefutable ability to liberate Ukraine is \u201c A Fiction \u201c , and yet another , pinching \u201c Half a Loaf \u201d smugly and stupidly claims that those like myself , who would rather see a short , comparatively bloodless war , even if it \u2019 s on our own land , instead of one that can easily spread into Europa and even across the Atlantic , actually \u201c predict ( and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , here \u2019 s my actual prediction and the hope of every decent and literate human being on this planet .\nListen .\nPOLLYANNAS \u2013 \u201c Stop hoping for the worst !\nLet \u2019 s all have a nice cup of tea.\n\u201d What I actually do predict , and do very much hope for , is a limited and localized Russian surgical military strike in Ukraine .\nOne that will remove the existential threat right on Russia \u2019 s doorstep , a threat not only to Russia , but to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will achieve all the strategic goals delineated by Russia in their recent collective security proposals to the US and NATO , ( which US/NATO refused ) while also saving tens or hundred of thousands of civilians in Donbass ( including myself and my family ) from genocide , and liberating Ukraine from foreign occupation and neo-nazi oppression .\nAll with the absolute minimum possible destruction and bloodshed of civilians and soldiers ( on BOTH sides ) alike .\nAs well as , and most importantly , the least likelihood of escalation anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These Pollyannas think that \u2019 s \u201c the worst \u201d ?\nWell , Cassandra has a question for them\u2026 CASSANDRA \u2013 \u201c Do you prefer your whole country be vaporized while you sing Kumbaya \u201d ?\nThese self-styled pundits say that Russia should simply ignore the plethora of concrete evidence of imminent war , and waste time holding further diplomatic meetings with the same nazis who have threatened their very existence for a century , who have murdered civilians in Donbass for the last 8 years , including the 298 civilians on MH-17 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanctioned Russia for it ) the same ones who directed ISIS cannibals to commit the false flag mass murders in Syria to create a Syrian \u201c chemical weapons \u201d narrative , then used the same bogus line in the UK with the laughable \u201c Novichuk \u201d fabrications .\n\u201c Yes , \u201d they say , \u201c if only Russia can just sit down in friendly dialogue with their mortal enemies once again , then perhaps a \u201c peaceful transition \u201d may someday be achieved .\nWe can only hope , peacefully praying and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while we all sing Kumbaya.\n\u201d This is literally what they are saying , in the face of a real life and imminent Armageddon .\nAnd like Neville Chamberlain , they advocate compromise with abject Evil , in the vain hope of \u201c peace in our time.\n\u201d All while these same US/NATO nazis continue to prepare and provoke Ukraine to war , to cross Russia \u2019 s red lines of no attack on Donbass , and no offensive missiles in Eastern Europe , bringing in weapons and ammo at a rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about \u201c the worst \u201d \u2013 nothing could be more fatally stupid , or more contemptible , craven and myopic .\nOr more certain to lead to a global conflagration , just as the appeasement of the obeisant English toady Chamberlain did only 84 years ago .\nWell , thanks be to God , Putin is not Chamberlain , and I am not Pollyanna .\nThomas Paine once wrote about such things , and I quote , \u201c I once felt all that kind of anger , which a man ought to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held by the Tories : a noted one , who kept a tavern at Amboy , was standing at his door , with as pretty a child in his hand , about eight or nine years old , as I ever saw , and after speaking his mind as freely as he thought was prudent , finished with this unfatherly expression , \u201c Well !\nGive me peace in my day.\n\u201d Not a man lives on the continent but fully believes that a confrontation must some time or other finally take place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , \u201c If there must be trouble , let it be in my day , that my child may have peace ; \u201d and this single reflection , well applied , is sufficient to awaken every man to his duty.\n\u201d I feel that anger too .\nAnd it awakens me to my duty , and it shows me the true worth , or rather , worthlessness , of all the boot-licking cowards and historically illiterate Pollyannas who advocate begging for peace at any price .\nLet them keep begging , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work really will make them free this time .\nBut we Russians , and all intelligent people , do not forget their history so easily .\nNot a man or woman lives in the Donbass Republics , in Russia or Ukraine , who does not know that this war will not end without a final battle .\nThis battle is as inevitable as the sunrise .\nOnly fools and Pollyannas could think it would be otherwise .\nSo , better to make it soon , short , and final , a lesson to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , where the Good Guys win again , just like they did in 1945 .\nThe only other alternative is to wait , to allow the Ukronazi infection to suppurate , and become more dangerous , adding more cost , more blood , more destroyed infrastructure and wasted treasure , before the final and inevitable victory of Russia and the Donbass Republics , or perhaps leading to a war that will engulf the world , a war that no one will win .\nRUSSIA \u2013 \u201c Those who fail to learn from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has learned the lesson .\nIf it must be taught again , we will teach it.\n\u201d No competent or qualified person can still continue to believe in , much less continue to talk about or advocate , a \u201c peaceful transition \u201d or \u201c diplomatic solution \u201d .\nOf course , Putin preferred a peaceful solution .\nHe is a most excellent Warrior and would win without fighting if it were possible in any way .\nThat was \u201c Plan A \u201d , and he tried for 8 years to implement it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by every means possible .\nThat is why he gave the US , NATO and OSCE a final chance to make one .\nBut they categorically refused , so there is none , and there will be none .\nIt is simply no longer a realistic option .\nIf it ever was\u2026 So , now to \u201c Plan B \u201d .\nRussia prefers a quick and decisive liberation of Ukraine over a potential world war , and has every right and every reason , and above all , the ability to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we will .\nAt the next provocation .\nIt will be up to the USA and NATO to decide if they will also escalate and engage in a war that will most certainly lead to their total dismemberment and defeat .\nRussia is ready for any scenario , and we will deal with it however it may be needed .\nAnd Vae victis \u2013 \u201c Woe to the vanquished.\n\u201d Now , are you listening ?\nI predict , with 90 % certainty , that a major ukrop attack or provocation will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with 99 % certainty before the end of March .\nI can say , based on impeccable sources and irrefutable evidence , that the plans and preparations for provocations and a major attack against Donbass have already been made .\nThe ukrops and their US masters may chicken out , as they have many times over the last few years .\nBut Russia is not a Pollyanna , not stupid enough to keep playing waiting games while their enemies build lethal force every day .\nThose who predict or advocate further diplomacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so is only deception and distraction .\nThe fuse is already lit , on both sides , the detonation will occur , one way or the other , before the end of March , and maybe much sooner .\nAnd when it does , I can assure you that the Russian response will be swift and sure , measured in minutes and ( very few ) hours , not days , or even one day .\nAnd Russia will not arrive ( initially ) on tanks and trucks , but on wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wings of Angels , for the nazis and terrorists who dare to attack us , the wings of instant and fiery death .\nThose who have failed to learn the lessons of Debaltsevo and Ilovaisk will be taught a final lesson with thunder and steel , and they will not live long enough to never forget it .\nThey have all been warned for the last time already .\nThe time for talking is over and done .\nIt is time for work , Brothers .\nThe job will not be easy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacks Donbass , attacks Russia .\nWho attacks Russia will be vanquished .\nThis is a warning .\nListen .\nWhile you still can .",
